*** 1.4.151 Sikhism Response

Sikhism articulates causation through the concept of Hukam (Divine Order), wherein the One formless God (Ek Onkar) operates as both efficient and material cause through sovereign will. Guru Nanak (1469-1539) established that causation flows exclusively from Waheguru's command, which sustains cosmic order while transcending rational comprehension. This theocentric causality rejects both mechanistic determinism and arbitrary caprice, presenting divine will as intelligible purpose expressed through natural law.

Historically, Guru Nanak's foundational teachings in the Japji Sahib (c. 1500) describe creation emerging from God's self-expression: "By His Command (Hukam) souls come into being; by His Command, glory and greatness are obtained" (Japji 2). Guru Arjan (1563-1606), compiling the Adi Granth (1604), systematized this cosmology wherein God functions as kartā (doer) and karaṇ (instrument). Guru Gobind Singh (1666-1708) in the Jaap Sahib emphasized God's paradoxical nature as both transcendent cause and immanent sustainer, beyond temporal limitation yet intimately engaged with creation.

The Sri Guru Granth Sahib provides textual foundation: "You Yourself are the Creator, and the Cause of causes" (SGGS 1402). Causation operates through three integrated principles: First, Hukam represents divine ordinance governing natural and moral order—not arbitrary decree but intelligible cosmic law. Second, karma functions as secondary causation within Hukam's framework, whereby actions generate proportionate consequences through divine justice. Third, grace (nadar) supersedes karmic determinism, allowing liberation through divine mercy rather than mechanical cause-effect.

Philosophically, Sikh causality addresses the problem of evil by distinguishing God's permissive will from active causation of suffering. The tradition maintains that human haumai (ego) distorts perception of Hukam, generating apparent disorder. God remains unstained by creation's imperfections while operating as ultimate efficient cause. Against Buddhist pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination without first cause), Sikhism insists on theistic grounding for causal chains.

Internal variations exist regarding determinism's extent. Some interpret Hukam as strict predestination, while mainstream Sikh philosophy emphasizes complementarity between divine sovereignty and human agency through the concept of sant-sipahi (saint-soldier) requiring moral effort. The Nirankari and Namdhari movements have offered divergent emphases on causation's mystical versus ethical dimensions.

Contemporary Sikh scholars like Bhai Vir Singh (1872-1957) and Kapur Singh (1909-1986) reconcile Hukam with scientific causality by interpreting divine command as natural law's metaphysical foundation. This allows engagement with modern physics while maintaining theological distinctiveness. Compared to Islamic occasionalism, Sikhism grants greater ontological stability to secondary causes while sharing emphasis on divine sovereignty over all causal relations.

*** 1.4.152 Sant Mat Response

Sant Mat conceptualizes causation through the doctrine of Shabd (Divine Sound Current), wherein ultimate reality manifests through vibrational emanation rather than mechanical production. This North Indian mystical tradition, crystallizing in the 13th-17th centuries, presents causation as descending sonic hierarchy wherein the Supreme Being (Anami Purush) projects creation through audible life stream. Causation thus operates vertically through spiritual regions rather than horizontally through temporal succession, making salvation a matter of ascending causal chains to their source.

Historically, Sant Kabir (1440-1518) established foundational teachings rejecting both Vedantic maya-vada and Islamic occasionalism in favor of emanationist causality. Kabir's Bijak describes creation flowing from unstruck sound (anahat nad): "The Word (Shabd) is the Guru, the consciousness my disciple." Guru Nanak synthesized Sant traditions, while Paltu Sahib (1710-1780) systematized cosmology identifying five causal regions (pind, anda, brahmand, par-brahmand, sach khand) through which Shabd descends. Soami Ji Maharaj (Shiv Dayal Singh, 1818-1878) formalized these teachings in the Sar Bachan, describing causation as divine current's progressive densification into matter.

Textual foundations rest in the sant-vani (sayings of saints) preserved in the Bijak, Adi Granth, and Sant Mat scriptures. The Sar Bachan Prose (Part I) articulates: "The entire creation came into being through the instrumentality of Shabd." Causation operates through surat-shabd-yoga (union of consciousness with divine sound), wherein spiritual practitioners reverse creation's causal flow through meditation on inner sound currents.

Philosophically, Sant Mat presents three causal principles: First, Shabd functions as both efficient and material cause, simultaneously creating and constituting reality through vibrational differentiation. Second, maya operates as derivative causality—the lower spiritual regions generate karmic causation binding souls to transmigration. Third, guru-kripa (grace) provides acausal intervention enabling soul's ascent beyond mechanical karma.

Against Advaita Vedanta's illusionism, Sant Mat insists on creation's relative reality while maintaining ultimate non-dualism at Radhasoami's level. The tradition addresses theodicy by spatializing evil—suffering results from soul's descent into lower causal regions rather than from divine intention. Lower worlds governed by Kal (Time/Death) operate through mechanistic karma, while higher regions transcend causation entirely.

Internal variations distinguish northern (Agra-based) from eastern (Bihar-based) lineages regarding causal cosmology's details. Some branches emphasize devotional causation (bhakti as transformative agent), while others stress meditation technique's mechanical efficacy.

Contemporary Sant Mat teachers like Maharaj Charan Singh (1916-1990) reconcile traditional cosmology with modern science by interpreting spiritual regions as consciousness levels rather than spatial locations. This preserves causal hierarchy while avoiding cosmological conflicts. Compared to Neoplatonism's emanationism, Sant Mat emphasizes sonic rather than intellectual emanation and insists on personal guru as necessary causal agent for liberation.

*** 1.4.153 Radha Soami Response

Radha Soami articulates causation through sophisticated emanationist cosmology wherein the Supreme Being (Radhasoami) generates creation through descending spiritual currents while remaining absolutely transcendent. Founded by Soami Ji Maharaj (Shiv Dayal Singh, 1818-1878) in Agra, this tradition presents causation as hierarchical manifestation through sound and light emanations creating nested spiritual regions, each governed by distinct causal principles. Unlike mechanical causation, Radha Soami describes creative process as living current (surat) descending through increasingly dense vibrational states.

Soami Ji's foundational teachings in Sar Bachan Radhasoami Poetry (1878) describe causation originating from Radhasoami's self-contemplation producing Sat Purush (True Being), from whom sound current (Shabd) emanates creating successive spiritual regions. Huzur Maharaj (Rai Saligram, 1829-1898) systematized this cosmology in Prem Patra, identifying eight causal stages from pure spirit to gross matter. Maharaj Sahab (Brahm Shankar Misra, 1861-1907) philosophically refined causation theory in Discourses on Radhasoami Faith, distinguishing three causal modes: creation (srishti), sustenance (sthiti), and dissolution (pralaya) occurring simultaneously across different spiritual planes.

Textual foundations rest in Sar Bachan Prose articulating: "The Radhasoami Himself is the creator, creation, and the process of creation." Causation operates through four integrated principles: First, Shabd-dhun (divine sound-current) functions as instrumental cause channeling Radhasoami's creative will. Second, Nam (Divine Name) serves as formal cause providing intelligible structure. Third, sant-sat-guru acts as efficient cause mediating between absolute and manifest realms. Fourth, karma governs secondary causation within created regions but cannot bind souls accessing higher causal currents.

Philosophically, Radha Soami addresses classical causation problems through spatial metaphysics. The tradition resolves creation ex nihilo paradoxes by proposing emanation without diminution—Radhasoami remains complete while projecting creation. Against occasionalism, Radha Soami grants ontological stability to spiritual regions while maintaining divine sovereignty. The system addresses evil's origin by identifying Kal (Time/Death) governing lower causal realms where suffering emerges from soul's forgetfulness, not divine intention.

Theodicy operates through causal regionalism: suffering results from soul's entanglement in lower causal zones where mechanistic karma dominates. Higher regions transcend suffering through direct participation in divine causality. Liberation (moksha) means reversing causal descent through surat-shabd-yoga, reuniting individual consciousness with its causal source.

Internal variations distinguish Agra (Soamibagh) from Beas branches regarding causal hierarchy's details. Soamibagh emphasizes Radhasoami's absolute transcendence over causal processes, while Beas tradition (Radha Soami Satsang Beas) stresses living master's causal agency in liberation. Dayalbagh branch incorporates social causation, viewing community development as expressing divine will.

Contemporary teachers like Maharaj Charan Singh reconcile traditional cosmology with quantum physics, interpreting spiritual regions as vibrational frequencies rather than spatial locations. This preserves hierarchical causation while engaging modern science. Compared to Neoplatonism, Radha Soami emphasizes sonic emanation over intellectual procession and insists on guru's necessity as causal mediator, distinguishing it from purely philosophical systems.

*** 1.4.154 Eckankar Response

Eckankar conceptualizes causation through the ECK (Divine Spirit/Sound Current) as ultimate causal principle operating through the Sugmad (God) across twelve distinct planes of existence. Founded by Paul Twitchell (1908-1971) in 1965, this new religious movement presents causation as manifestation of divine light and sound flowing from God through hierarchical spiritual worlds, with each plane governed by distinct causal laws. Unlike linear mechanical causation, Eckankar teaches simultaneous multi-level causation wherein soul experiences multiple causal frameworks depending on consciousness level.

Twitchell's foundational texts, particularly The Tiger's Fang (1967) and The Spiritual Notebook (1971), describe creation emerging from the Sugmad's self-contemplation generating the ECK as active causal agent. The ECK manifests through the Mahanta (inner spiritual guide) and Living ECK Master who function as causal channels between absolute and relative realms. Harold Klemp (1942-present), current Living ECK Master since 1981, systematized causation theory in Soul Travelers of the Far Country (1987), describing how consciousness creates experience through attention and spiritual unfoldment rather than mechanistic determinism.

Textual foundations rest in the Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad (sacred scripture) declaring: "The ECK is the cause of all causes, the life of all life." Causation operates through four integrated principles: First, divine imagination (God's creative visualization) serves as efficient cause projecting all worlds. Second, karma functions as balancing mechanism within lower worlds but becomes transcended in higher causal regions. Third, soul itself participates in causation through co-creative capacity—consciousness shapes experience through spiritual unfoldment. Fourth, the Living ECK Master operates as causal intervention point, accelerating spiritual evolution beyond mechanical progression.

Philosophically, Eckankar addresses free will versus determinism through doctrine of spiritual freedom—soul possesses eternal nature beyond causal determination while temporarily experiencing causal laws during spiritual education. Against materialist reductionism, Eckankar insists consciousness precedes and generates matter through creative imagination. The tradition resolves problem of evil by teaching that suffering emerges from soul's limited awareness in lower causal planes, not divine punishment.

Causation varies across twelve planes from physical (governed by mechanical causation) through astral, causal, mental, etheric to Soul Plane (where karma ceases) and beyond to pure God-worlds where causation dissolves into direct divine will. Liberation means recognizing soul's independence from causal determination through spiritual exercises accessing higher planes.

Internal variations exist regarding karma's extent. Orthodox Eckankar teaching emphasizes transcending karma through spiritual exercises, while some practitioners emphasize balancing karma as prerequisite for higher realization. Debates continue regarding whether Living ECK Master can fully override individual karma or merely accelerate its resolution.

Contemporary Eckankar presents causation compatible with quantum physics' observer effect—consciousness affects reality through observation, paralleling spiritual teaching that awareness shapes experience. Critics note similarities to Sant Mat cosmology, which Eckankar acknowledges while claiming more systematic presentation and emphasis on individual spiritual freedom rather than guru dependency. Compared to Theosophy's hierarchical cosmos, Eckankar emphasizes practical soul travel techniques over intellectual cosmology, distinguishing experiential from philosophical approaches to causation.

*** 1.4.155 Transcendental Meditation Response

Transcendental Meditation (TM), founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1918-2008), articulates causation through Vedic Science identifying pure consciousness (transcendental Being) as unified field generating all manifest diversity through sequential unfoldment of natural law. This tradition presents causation as intelligence inherent in consciousness itself, operating through hierarchical levels from unmanifest pure awareness to expressed material forms. Unlike mechanistic causation, TM describes creative process as self-interacting dynamics of consciousness knowing itself, with meditation providing direct access to causation's source.

Maharishi's foundational teachings developed through three phases: early focus on transcendental Being as source (Science of Being and Art of Living, 1963); middle period systematizing Vedic cosmology (Maharishi's Absolute Theory of Government, 1993); late synthesis with quantum physics (Maharishi Vedic Science, 1990s). His commentary on Bhagavad-Gita (1967) presents causation rooted in self-referral consciousness: "The unmanifest Being is the cause and basis of all that exists in the relative field of life." These teachings draw from Shankaracharya's Advaita Vedanta while emphasizing practical technique over philosophical speculation.

Textual foundations rest in Vedic literature, particularly Rig Veda's apaurusheya (unauthored) hymns understood as primordial sound patterns through which consciousness creates. Maharishi interpreted "Ritam bhara pragna" (Yoga Sutras 1.48) as consciousness bearing natural law, identifying pure consciousness as both knower and process of knowing, constituting causation through self-interaction. The Vedic literature's sequential unfoldment from Rik (point value) through Sama (infinity value) to Yajur (junction point) maps causation's emergence from unity to diversity.

Philosophically, TM presents causation through five integrated principles: First, pure consciousness (Atman/Being) functions as material cause containing all possibilities in unmanifest form. Second, self-referral dynamics—consciousness knowing itself—serves as efficient cause transforming potential into actual. Third, natural law (Rishi-Devata-Chhandas structure) operates as formal cause organizing creation intelligently. Fourth, karma functions as secondary causation within manifest realm. Fifth, collective consciousness influences causation through maharishi effect—coherent group meditation affecting broader reality.

Against materialist emergence theory, TM insists consciousness precedes matter as fundamental reality. The tradition resolves mind-body problem by identifying both as expressions of unified consciousness at different levels. Causation operates simultaneously top-down (consciousness manifesting as matter) and bottom-up (matter evolving toward conscious expression), reconciled through holographic principle wherein each level contains totality.

Internal variations distinguish orthodox TM emphasizing meditation technique from broader TM movement incorporating Ayurveda, Jyotish, and Vedic architecture as applied causation sciences. Some practitioners emphasize personal development, others social transformation through collective consciousness.

Contemporary TM research correlates meditation with neurophysiological changes, presenting empirical evidence for consciousness-based causation. Physicist John Hagelin's identification of unified field (quantum physics) with pure consciousness (Vedic Science) attempts bridging traditional and modern causation theories. Compared to Buddhist emptiness, TM emphasizes fullness of pure consciousness as causal ground. Unlike classical Advaita's maya-vada, TM grants creation relative reality as actual expression of consciousness, making causation real though derivative.

*** 1.4.156 ISKCON (Hare Krishna) Response

ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) articulates causation through Gaudiya Vaishnavism's acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva (inconceivable simultaneous oneness and difference), wherein Krishna as Supreme Personality of Godhead operates as complete efficient and material cause while remaining absolutely transcendent. Founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977) in 1966, this tradition presents causation as lila (divine play) wherein Krishna manifests material and spiritual worlds through inconceivable potency (shakti) for souls' spiritual education and devotional exchange. Unlike impersonal emanationism, ISKCON emphasizes personal causation directed toward loving relationships.

Prabhupada's foundational teachings systematized through Bhagavad-gita As It Is (1968) and Srimad-Bhagavatam commentaries present Krishna declaring: "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me" (BG 10.8). This develops Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's (1486-1534) synthesis of earlier Vedantic schools, particularly building on Madhvacharya's dualism (1238-1317) and Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism (1017-1137) while emphasizing devotion over philosophical speculation. The Six Goswamis of Vrindavan (16th century), especially Jiva Goswami's Sat-sandarbha, philosophically grounded causation in Krishna's threefold energies.

Textual foundations rest in Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, and Chaitanya Charitamrita articulating three causal principles: First, Krishna's para-shakti (superior spiritual energy) generates eternal spiritual world without temporal causation. Second, kshara-shakti (inferior material energy/maya) produces temporal creation through sequential cosmological ages governed by karma and guna (material qualities). Third, tatastha-shakti (marginal energy) produces jiva souls possessing limited independence, making them participants in rather than products of material causation.

Philosophically, ISKCON addresses causation through five integrated arguments: First, Krishna remains complete (purnam) despite projecting creation—"the complete whole remains completely whole even after complete manifestations from it" (Isopanishad invocation). Second, causation operates through inconceivable potency reconciling God's immutability with creative activity. Third, material causation serves teleological purpose—providing opportunity for conditioned souls' purification through karma-yoga leading to bhakti-yoga. Fourth, devotional causation (grace) supersedes mechanical karma, enabling liberation through Krishna's direct intervention. Fifth, ultimate causation aims toward rasa (devotional relationship) rather than mere existence.

Against Advaita's maya-vada treating creation as illusion, ISKCON insists on relative reality's ontological status as actual manifestation of divine energy. The tradition resolves theodicy by distinguishing Krishna's responsibility for causal framework from jiva's misuse of independence causing suffering. Material world functions as correctional rather than punitive environment.

Internal variations distinguish philosophical emphasis from devotional practice. Some ISKCON scholars emphasize systematic Vedantic causation theory, while devotional practitioners focus on surrendered acceptance of Krishna's will. Regional variations exist between Indian traditional and Western convert communities regarding karma's operational details.

Contemporary ISKCON scholars like Ravindra Svarupa Dasa reconcile Vedantic causation with modern cosmology by interpreting puranic chronology symbolically while maintaining Krishna's ultimate causal agency. The Bhaktivedanta Institute explores consciousness-based causation paralleling quantum observer effects. Compared to Christian creation ex nihilo, ISKCON's emanationism maintains continuity between creator and creation through energy doctrine. Unlike impersonal Brahman of Advaita, Krishna's personhood makes causation intentional and relational, directed toward devotional exchange rather than necessity or accident.

*** 1.4.157 Brahma Kumaris Response

Brahma Kumaris articulates causation through cyclical cosmology wherein incorporeal Supreme Soul (Shiva) operates as efficient but not material cause, guiding eternal souls and prakriti (matter-energy) through precise 5,000-year cycles without creating or destroying fundamental reality. Founded by Prajapita Brahma (Dada Lekhraj, 1876-1969) following revelatory experiences beginning 1936, this movement presents causation as predetermined divine drama (kalpa) eternally repeating, wherein present actions constitute past causes in next cycle. Unlike linear causation, Brahma Kumaris teaches identical repetition (sarva samaan) making future and past causally equivalent.

Brahma Baba's revelatory experiences, systematized by administrative head Dadi Prakashmani (1922-2007) and chief teacher Dadi Janki (1916-2020), articulated through Raja Yoga meditation courses, present causation through trimurti (three aspects): Brahma (subtle change), Vishnu (sustenance), Shankara (transformation), all directed by incorporeal Shiva. The foundational Murli (daily teachings) received through trance mediumship describe causation: "This unlimited drama is eternally predestined. Your part of 84 births continues to repeat identically." This challenges conventional causation by denying genuine novelty while maintaining karmic responsibility within cyclical framework.

Textual foundations rest in daily Murlis and essential texts like "Essence of Murli" presenting three causal principles: First, eternal law (anadi, eternal drama) governs cyclical repetition wherein each 5,000-year cycle divides into Golden, Silver, Copper, and Iron Ages with predetermined duration and characteristics. Second, souls' sanskaras (impressions) from previous cycle determine present actions, creating circular rather than linear causation. Third, Shiva's intervention at cycle's end (Confluence Age/Sangam Yuga) provides knowledge enabling liberation from bodily consciousness, though this intervention itself repeats eternally.

Philosophically, Brahma Kumaris addresses causation through distinctive arguments: First, eternal drama reconciles determinism with moral responsibility—actions are predetermined yet souls experience agency through forgetfulness of repetition. Second, causation operates tri-temporally—present contains past and future simultaneously since cycles repeat identically. Third, Supreme Soul operates as teacher and guide rather than creator, providing knowledge as causal intervention without violating souls' eternal independence. Fourth, matter-energy (prakriti) exists eternally uncreated, eliminating creation ex nihilo problems.

Against monotheistic creation theology, Brahma Kumaris denies ultimate beginning, teaching eternal existence of three entities: Supreme Soul, individual souls (maximum 900 million), and prakriti. This resolves first cause regression by denying causal origin entirely. The tradition addresses evil through kalpa doctrine—degradation occurs necessarily through cycle's iron age (Kali Yuga) preparing transformation into golden age (Sat Yuga), making suffering teleologically necessary.

Internal variations exist regarding determinism's strictness. Orthodox teaching emphasizes identical repetition, while some practitioners interpret samaan as similarity rather than identity, allowing minor variations. Debates continue regarding whether effort affects liberation or merely fulfills predetermined script.

Contemporary Brahma Kumaris engage environmental and social causation through "Positive Thinking" campaigns and UN partnerships, presenting meditation as causally efficacious for global transformation despite underlying determinism. This apparent contradiction resolves through understanding present actions as fulfilling predetermined beneficial roles. Compared to Jainism's eternal uncreated universe, Brahma Kumaris adds cyclical repetition and divine guidance. Unlike Nietzsche's eternal recurrence emphasizing tragic repetition, Brahma Kumaris presents cycles optimistically as opportunities for spiritual elevation, with causation serving soteriological purpose within predetermined framework.
