*** 1.19.136 Art of Living (Sri Sri Ravi Shankar) Response

Space and time do not exist independently of consciousness but emerge from the field of pure awareness, according to the Art of Living tradition founded by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in 1981. This neo-Vedantic movement synthesizes Advaita Vedanta with quantum physics concepts, proposing that space-time represents modifications (vritti) of consciousness rather than absolute realities. The tradition's position crystallized through Ravi Shankar's commentary on Ashtavakra Gita and Yoga Sutras, particularly from the 1990s onward when he began explicitly addressing scientific cosmology.

Drawing on Patanjali's concept of desha (space) and kala (time) as mental constructs in Yoga Sutras III.52-53, the tradition argues that meditation experiences reveal space-time's dependence on awareness. The technical framework employs "zero-field" theory—consciousness as shunyata (void) from which spatial and temporal distinctions arise through vritti-pravaha (thought-flow). Ravi Shankar's "Celebrating Silence" (1995) articulates how turiya (fourth state) transcends normal space-time perception, suggesting these dimensions exist only in waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states.

The tradition cites Mandukya Upanishad's analysis of consciousness states and Bhagavad Gita 2.16 ("the unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be") to support the view that space-time belongs to vyavaharika (empirical reality) rather than paramarthika (absolute reality). Internal variations exist between teachers emphasizing psychological versus ontological interpretations—some viewing space-time as purely mental constructs, others as real but dependent manifestations of consciousness-energy (chit-shakti).

Materialist objections argue that consciousness depends on brain processes occurring in space-time, making awareness derivative rather than fundamental. The tradition responds that quantum non-locality and observer effects suggest consciousness precedes spatial separation, citing delayed-choice experiments as evidence.

Contemporary applications engage string theory's dimensional framework and loop quantum gravity's discrete space-time structure as partial validations of Vedantic insights into space-time's non-absolute nature. The Art of Living Academy's "Vedic Wisdom and Modern Science" programs explore parallels between akasha-kala tattvas and spacetime manifolds in general relativity.

Comparatively, this position aligns closely with Yogacara Buddhist consciousness-only doctrine and Kashmir Shaivism's prakasha-vimarsha framework, while differing from Nyaya-Vaisheshika atomism that grants paramanu (atoms) independent spatial existence. The tradition's integration of meditation phenomenology with physics discourse represents contemporary neo-Vedanta's characteristic approach to cosmological questions.

*** 1.19.137 Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi) Response

Space and time exist as projections of supreme consciousness (brahman) rather than independent realities, according to the Mata Amritanandamayi Math tradition. Amma's teachings, articulated from the early 1980s through darshan sessions and recorded dialogues, present a devotional Advaita framework where space-time emerges from divine consciousness like waves from ocean. The tradition's systematic position developed through Swami Amritaswarupananda's compilations, particularly "Awaken, Children!" series (1989-2019), which documents Amma's responses to scientific and philosophical questions.

The philosophical foundation rests on Shankara's Advaita while emphasizing bhakti epistemology—knowing through loving surrender rather than intellectual analysis. Amma employs the metaphor of consciousness as infinite ocean (samudra) and space-time as finite waves (taranga), arguing that just as waves cannot exist without water, spatial and temporal distinctions cannot exist without consciousness-substrate. The technical term chidakasha (consciousness-space) designates the fundamental reality, distinguished from bhutakasha (physical space) and hridayakasha (heart-space). These three levels represent stages from absolute to empirical reality.

Scriptural support draws from Chandogya Upanishad 7.25.1 ("infinite alone is bliss") and Vivekachudamani verses on maya-projection theory. Amma's Bhagavad Gita commentaries emphasize Krishna's statement in 9.4 ("by Me, unmanifest, this whole world is pervaded") as indicating space's dependence on divine consciousness.

Internal variations exist between Amma's direct mystical teachings and the more systematic Advaitic philosophy of her senior disciples. Some devotees interpret space-time psychologically (as mental constructs), while monastics emphasize ontological dependence on brahman.

Scientific materialists object that empirical evidence shows consciousness emerging from brain processes in space-time. The tradition responds that neuroscience observes correlations, not causation, and that pure consciousness precedes neurological activity as ground-state.

Contemporary engagement includes Amma's environmental initiatives framing ecological interconnectedness in terms of spatial-temporal unity in consciousness. The Amrita University's physics department explores connections between Advaita and quantum field theory, particularly zero-point energy as modern analogue to akasha.

Comparatively, this devotional Advaita differs from Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita by denying independent reality to space-time even as divine attributes, while sharing Kashmir Shaivism's emanationist cosmology where space-time represents spanda (divine vibration). The emphasis on experiential realization through bhakti distinguishes this tradition from more intellectualist Advaitic schools.

*** 1.19.138 Sathya Sai Baba Movement Response

Space and time constitute relative realities wholly dependent on the Supreme Being (Parama Brahman) who transcends all spatiotemporal limitations, according to Sathya Sai Baba's teachings (1926-2011). This modern Hindu movement, formalized through the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust from the 1970s, presents an integrative theology combining Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita, and devotional theism. Sathya Sai Baba's "Summer Showers" discourses (1972-2000) systematically address cosmological questions, arguing that space-time arises from divine sankalpa (will) and remains continuously dependent on divine consciousness for existence.

The philosophical framework employs Vedantic categories while emphasizing avatara metaphysics—the principle that divine incarnations transcend space-time while operating within it. Sathya Sai teachings distinguish between three levels: Atmatatwa (absolute reality beyond space-time), Hiranyagarbha (cosmic consciousness containing space-time), and Virat (manifested universe of space-time). The technical term sarva-vyapi (all-pervading) describes how divinity exists beyond spatial extension while pervading all space, and nitya (eternal) indicates transcendence of temporal succession while being present at all times.

Scriptural citations include Bhagavad Gita 9.4-5 where Krishna describes pervading the cosmos while remaining transcendent, and Purusha Sukta describing space arising from cosmic sacrifice. Sathya Sai's "Vahini" series, particularly Jnana Vahini (1959), explicates how maya creates illusory space-time divisions within non-dual reality.

Internal debates concern whether Sathya Sai's miracles (materialization, bilocation) demonstrate mastery over space-time or reveal their unreality. Conservative interpretations emphasize transcendence, while devotional approaches stress divine manipulation of space-time fabric.

Rationalist critics argue that claimed space-time transcendence cannot be empirically verified and contradicts physical laws. The movement responds that limited human perception within space-time cannot judge realities beyond these dimensions, citing quantum non-locality as suggestive evidence.

Contemporary applications include educational institutions (Sri Sathya Sai University) exploring consciousness and physics, particularly investigating whether quantum measurement depends on observer consciousness. The movement's medical and service projects embody teachings about interconnectedness beyond spatial separation.

Comparatively, this position resembles Gaudiya Vaishnavism's simultaneous transcendence-immanence (achintya-bheda-abheda) while maintaining stronger Advaitic elements. Unlike purely non-dualistic traditions, Sathya Sai theology preserves divine personality transcending space-time, closer to Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism. The avatara-centric cosmology distinguishes this movement from teacher-based guru traditions.

*** 1.19.139 Osho (Rajneesh) Movement Response

Space and time exist as psychological constructs of the conditioned mind rather than independent realities, according to Rajneesh/Osho's teachings (1931-1990). This controversial neo-sannyasa movement, formalized through Rajneesh Foundation International in the 1970s-80s, presents a radical phenomenological Buddhism-influenced position: space-time represents thought-created categories that dissolve in meditation. Osho's extensive discourse collections, particularly "The Book of Secrets" (on Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, 1972) and "Zen: The Path of Paradox" (1977), articulate how witnessing consciousness (sakshi) transcends spatiotemporal frameworks.

Drawing eclectically from Zen, Tantra, and Advaita, Osho argues that space-time belongs entirely to mind's conceptualizing function. The technical framework employs "gap-theory"—in moments between thoughts, space-time disappears, revealing their dependency on mental activity. Osho distinguishes between clock-time (chronological measurement) and psychological time (memory-anticipation), arguing both are mind-generated. The term "no-mind" (amann) designates awareness beyond spatiotemporal categorization, similar to Zen's mu-shin but with explicit anti-metaphysical emphasis.

While formally citing Upanishads and Buddhist sutras, Osho reinterprets texts psychologically rather than metaphysically. He uses Shiva Sutras' concept of space as consciousness (chidakasha) to argue space exists only in awareness, not independently. However, unlike traditional Advaita, Osho rejects brahman ontology, viewing space-time dissolution as purely experiential rather than revealing ultimate reality.

Internal tensions exist between followers emphasizing psychological liberation versus those maintaining metaphysical interpretations. Osho's "Zorba the Buddha" synthesis creates ambiguity—celebrating material existence while denying space-time independence.

Scientific realists argue that physics demonstrates space-time's mind-independence through cosmological evidence predating consciousness. Osho countered that all evidence appears to consciousness, making consciousness logically prior regardless of content.

Contemporary relevance appears in mindfulness movements exploring time-perception alterations and neuroscience studies on meditation's effects on spatial-temporal processing. Osho International's programs emphasize experiential verification rather than theoretical cosmology.

Comparatively, this position resembles Yogacara Buddhism's mind-only doctrine and phenomenological approaches more than traditional Hindu cosmology. Unlike Shankara's Advaita with its brahman ontology, or devotional traditions with divine cosmologies, Osho's framework remains radically experiential and anti-systematic. The emphasis on deconditioning rather than truth-realization distinguishes this movement from classical philosophical schools, aligning more with Zen's pragmatic approach while lacking traditional Buddhist ethical-metaphysical frameworks.

*** 1.19.140 Ramakrishna Mission (Vedanta Society) Response

Space and time exist as relative realities dependent on Brahman-consciousness but possess pragmatic validity within empirical experience, according to Ramakrishna Mission's Practical Vedanta. Founded by Swami Vivekananda (1897) based on Sri Ramakrishna's teachings (1836-1886), this movement articulates a nuanced position balancing Advaita metaphysics with phenomenological realism. The systematic exposition developed through Vivekananda's lectures, particularly "Jnana Yoga" (1896) and "Raja Yoga" (1896), and later through Swami Nikhilananda's and Swami Prabhavananda's scholarly works (1940s-1970s).

The philosophical framework employs Shankara's tri-level reality theory (paramarthika, vyavaharika, pratibhasika) while emphasizing experiential verification through yoga. Space (desha) and time (kala) belong to vyavaharika-satya (empirical reality)—neither absolutely real like Brahman nor entirely unreal like illusions, but relatively real as maya-projections. Ramakrishna's mystical experiences, documented in "Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna," describe samadhi states transcending space-time, suggesting these dimensions depend on consciousness-modifications rather than existing independently.

Scriptural authority derives from Shankara's Advaita commentaries, particularly on Brahma Sutras and Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1 ("Being alone existed in the beginning"). However, the Mission emphasizes Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.5.15's holistic cosmology and Bhagavad Gita's karma-yoga, validating empirical space-time's importance for ethical action.

Significant internal variation exists between "hard Advaita" emphasizing space-time's unreality (influenced by Swami Ashokananda) and "practical Vedanta" validating scientific cosmology (championed by Swami Ranganathananda, 1908-2005). The latter's "The Message of the Upanishads" (1985) attempts reconciliation with relativity theory.

Materialist critics argue that validating empirical space-time contradicts claims of its Brahman-dependence. The Mission responds through epistemological distinction: space-time exists conventionally but not ultimately, similar to how waves exist dependently on ocean.

Contemporary engagement includes Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture's publications exploring quantum physics and Vedanta, particularly Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as supporting non-absolute space-time. Swami Ranganathananda's dialogues with physicists explored whether quantum fields approximate akasha concept.

Comparatively, this position mediates between Shankara's strict Advaita (denying space-time's reality) and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita (affirming qualified reality). Unlike Neo-Vedanta movements embracing scientific materialism, Ramakrishna Mission maintains metaphysical priority of consciousness while respecting empirical science's domain. The emphasis on practical realization rather than theoretical consistency distinguishes this pragmatic Vedanta from more systematically rigorous philosophical schools.

*** 1.19.141 Self-Realization Fellowship (Yogananda) Response

Space and time exist as relativistic manifestations of divine consciousness rather than independent absolutes, according to Paramahansa Yogananda's (1893-1952) teachings and the Self-Realization Fellowship founded in 1920. This East-West synthesis presents a sophisticated integration of Vedantic cosmology with Einstein's relativity, arguing that space-time constitutes maya's dreamlike projection within God-consciousness. Yogananda's systematic exposition appears in "Autobiography of a Yogi" (1946), "The Second Coming of Christ" (2004, posthumous), and "God Talks with Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita" (1995, posthumous), where he explicitly engages modern physics.

The philosophical framework employs kriya yoga metaphysics with distinctive Christian-Vedantic terminology. Space-time represents God's "Cosmic Dream" (vishwa-svapna) or "Cosmic Delusion" (maha-maya), having dependent reality as divine manifestation. Yogananda's technical innovation involves "astral" and "causal" cosmology: physical space-time (gross), astral space-time (subtle energy realms), and causal realm (ideational seeds) all depend on supracosmic consciousness transcending spatiotemporal categories. The term "Cosmic Consciousness" designates awareness beyond space-time limitations, while maintaining that space-time serves divine purpose in soul evolution.

Scriptural synthesis draws from Bhagavad Gita 9.4-10 (Krishna pervading cosmos) and John 1:3 ("all things were made through Him"), arguing both traditions teach space-time's derivative status. Yogananda's Gita commentary extensively cites Patanjali's Yoga Sutras on transcending desha-kala through samyama.

Internal variations exist between literalist followers emphasizing astral cosmology's physical reality and metaphorical interpreters viewing these as consciousness-states. Sri Daya Mata's conservative approach contrasted with some Western disciples' more symbolic readings.

Scientific materialists object that invoking consciousness to explain space-time lacks empirical support and explanatory power. The Fellowship responds by citing quantum observer effects and arguing that consciousness-primacy resolves measurement problems better than materialist interpretations.

Contemporary applications include extensive engagement with relativity theory—Yogananda taught that Einstein's space-time relativity empirically validates Vedantic maya doctrine. The Fellowship's publications explore whether quantum non-locality and entanglement demonstrate space-time's non-fundamental nature, suggesting fields of consciousness as more basic than spacetime manifolds.

Comparatively, this position resembles Aurobindo's evolutionary cosmology in validating progressive manifestation, while differing by emphasizing liberation from rather than transformation of material creation. Unlike purely Advaitic schools denying multiplicity's reality, Yogananda maintains qualified reality for creation's purpose in divine plan, closer to Ramanuja's thought. The explicit physics engagement distinguishes Self-Realization Fellowship from most traditional Hindu schools.

*** 1.19.142 Anandamayi Ma Tradition Response

Space and time possess no independent existence but appear as spontaneous play (lila) of undifferentiated consciousness, according to the teachings of Anandamayi Ma (1896-1982) and her tradition. This non-systematic, experience-centered Advaita lineage, formalized through Shree Shree Anandamayee Sangha from the 1950s, presents a radically non-dual position where space-time represents apparent modifications within changeless awareness. The tradition's philosophy emerges not from systematic texts but from Ma's spontaneous utterances compiled in "Matri Vani" (Mother's Words) and "Sad Vani" (Eternal Words), interpreted by disciples like Bhaiji (Jyotish Chandra Ray) and Gurupriya Devi.

Anandamayi Ma's distinctive approach emphasizes kevala-advaita (absolute non-dualism) without concessions to gradualism or relative reality. She employed terms like "khela" (divine play) and "akhand" (unbroken wholeness) to indicate that space-time divisions represent consciousness's self-entertainment rather than genuine multiplicity. Her teaching that "sab ek hi hai" (all is one only) denies ontological status to spatial-temporal distinctions. The technical framework uses "bhavasamadhi" (spontaneous absorption) where space-time awareness dissolves without meditation effort, suggesting these dimensions lack substantial reality.

While Ma rarely cited scriptures systematically, disciples reference Ashtavakra Gita's pure Advaita and Ribhu Gita's radical non-dualism. Her interpretation of "tat tvam asi" (thou art that) eliminates any gap—spatial, temporal, or conceptual—between individual and absolute.

Significant variation exists between Ma's direct non-dual utterances and disciples' attempts at systematic exposition. Some followers (like Atmananda) maintain strict position denying space-time's conventional reality, while others (like Bithika Mukerji) allow educational concessions to dualistic perspectives.

Philosophical objections argue that denying space-time's independent reality contradicts empirical experience of causation and change. Ma typically responded not with arguments but with pointing toward direct realization where questions dissolve.

Contemporary relevance appears less in theoretical cosmology than in phenomenological investigations of meditation states. Anandamayi Ma Ashram's educational programs explore consciousness studies, though without Ma's earlier scientific engagement.

Comparatively, this radical non-dualism exceeds even Shankara's allowance for vyavaharika-satya (conventional reality), resembling instead Gaudapada's ajativada (non-origination doctrine) where nothing ever comes into existence. Unlike systematic Advaita schools with elaborate cosmologies, Ma's tradition emphasizes that ultimate truth transcends cosmological speculation entirely. The spontaneous, play-centered framework differs from meditation-path traditions, suggesting enlightenment as natural state rather than achievement, with space-time concepts as temporary obscuration rather than real bondage.

*** 1.19.143 Ramana Maharshi Advaita Response

Space and time exist solely within the mind and have no independent reality apart from the Self (atman), according to Ramana Maharshi's (1879-1950) teaching and the Advaita lineage continuing through Sri Ramanasramam. This modern renaissance of classical Advaita, systematized through "Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi" (1955), "Who Am I?" (Nan Yar, 1902), and disciple writings by Arthur Osborne, David Godman, and S.S. Cohen (1940s-1990s), presents the most uncompromising non-dual position on space-time among contemporary traditions.

Ramana's philosophical framework centers on atma-vichara (self-inquiry) revealing that space-time belongs entirely to the mind-body complex rather than to true Self. His teaching employs the technical distinction between "I" (pure awareness) and "I-thought" (ego creating space-time framework). The classic formulation states: "Time and space are in the mind, but the true Self is beyond mind, therefore beyond time and space." Ramana references Vivekachudamani's analysis of superimposition (adhyasa) where spatial-temporal limitations are falsely attributed to limitless awareness. The term "ajata" (non-origination) from Gaudapada's Karikas indicates that space-time never actually arises—what appears as cosmic manifestation represents mistaken perception.

Scriptural authority derives from Ashtavakra Gita, Ribhu Gita, and especially Advaita portions of Upanishads. Ramana's commentary on "Ulladu Narpadu" (Forty Verses on Reality, his own composition) systematically demonstrates space-time's mind-dependence. Verse 16 argues: "When we scrutinize time and space, they resolve into the Self; therefore how can they be real?"

Minimal internal variation exists given the tradition's focus on direct experience over theoretical elaboration. However, Western interpreters sometimes psychologize Ramana's teaching (space-time as mental constructs) versus traditional Advaitic ontology (space-time as maya-projections).

Scientific realists argue that physics demonstrates space-time's observer-independence through cosmological evidence. Ramana's response, preserved in conversations, maintains that all evidence appears to consciousness, which alone self-validates without requiring space-time framework.

Contemporary engagement includes David Godman's and Michael James's writings exploring whether quantum mechanics' observer-dependence and relativity's space-time relativity align with Ramana's position. The tradition generally avoids claiming scientific validation, emphasizing experiential self-inquiry over theoretical cosmology.

Comparatively, Ramana's teaching represents purest advaita-vada, closer to Gaudapada than Shankara by rejecting even provisional reality for space-time. Unlike Yoga traditions accepting mind-body practices in space-time, or devotional schools validating divine manifestation, Ramana points directly to awareness transcending all spatiotemporal frameworks. The methodology of self-inquiry rather than meditation practice distinguishes this tradition, as does radical emphasis on present-moment awareness beyond temporal succession.

*** 1.19.144 Nisargadatta Maharaj Advaita Response

Space and time possess no independent existence whatsoever but appear exclusively within consciousness as fleeting modifications of awareness, according to Nisargadatta Maharaj's (1897-1981) radical Advaita teaching preserved through "I Am That" (1973), "Prior to Consciousness" (1985), and subsequent transcripts. This Navnath Sampradaya lineage, transmitted through Siddharameshwar Maharaj, presents an uncompromising position: space-time constitutes conceptual overlay on pure being-awareness (sat-chit), having no more independent reality than dream objects.

Nisargadatta's philosophical framework employs technical Marathi-Sanskrit terminology: "mahamaya" (great illusion) designating the space-time appearance, "parabrahman" indicating absolute beyond consciousness itself, and crucially, "beingness" (sattva) as the primary illusion from which space-time derives. His distinctive contribution distinguishes between "I Am" (consciousness requiring space-time framework) and absolute (beyond even consciousness). The technical innovation involves three-level analysis: Absolute (beyond space-time and consciousness), Consciousness/Beingness (containing space-time appearances), and phenomenal world (space-time experience). Space-time exists in the second level only, having zero status in absolute reality.

While rarely citing scriptures formally, Nisargadatta's teaching resonates with Ashtavakra Gita's pure non-dualism and Avadhuta Gita's radical formulations. His interpretation transcends even classical Advaita by questioning consciousness itself as ultimate reality, suggesting space-time's double-dependency: on consciousness, which itself depends on Absolute.

Significant internal tension exists between "I Am That" period emphasizing consciousness-primacy and later teachings subordinating consciousness to Absolute. Early students (like Jean Dunn) focused on consciousness transcending space-time, while later interpreters (like Robert Powell) emphasize the Absolute beyond consciousness-unconsciousness duality.

Philosophical objections note that denying independent reality to both space-time and consciousness undermines the very framework for discussion. Nisargadatta responded that logical consistency matters only within mental framework he aimed to transcend.

Contemporary applications remain limited to consciousness studies and phenomenology rather than physics engagement. The tradition's apophatic approach resists scientific synthesis, viewing empirical investigation as occurring entirely within the illusion requiring transcendence.

Comparatively, Nisargadatta's position exceeds both Shankara (who maintains consciousness-brahman identity) and Ramana (who identifies Self with consciousness). By placing space-time in consciousness and consciousness in Absolute, he creates double-dependency unique among Advaita schools. Unlike Tantra's celebration of manifestation or Yoga's progressive realization, this teaching points to immediate recognition of what precedes space-time and consciousness simultaneously. The working-class, spontaneous presentation distinguished Nisargadatta from scholarly traditions while maintaining radical philosophical rigor.

*** 1.19.145 Swami Vivekananda Neo-Vedanta Response

Space and time exist as relative categories dependent on Absolute Existence-Consciousness-Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda) while possessing pragmatic validity for empirical science and ethical action, according to Swami Vivekananda's (1863-1902) Neo-Vedanta synthesizing Shankara's Advaita with Western philosophy and science. This foundational formulation of modern Hindu thought, articulated through Complete Works (lectures 1893-1902), presents sophisticated epistemological framework where space-time belongs to vyavaharika-satya (empirical reality) without independent ontological status, yet deserves serious engagement rather than dismissal as mere illusion.

Vivekananda's philosophical innovation involves reconciling Kantian critical philosophy with Advaita Vedanta. He explicitly compares Kant's space-time as forms of intuition to Vedantic maya-categories, arguing both traditions recognize these dimensions as mind-contributed rather than thing-in-itself features. However, unlike Kant's agnosticism regarding noumena, Vedanta claims direct realization of Brahman beyond space-time through samadhi. The technical framework employs Shankara's adhyasa (superimposition) doctrine while validating scientific investigation within empirical realm. Vivekananda distinguishes between "time and space in God" versus "God in time and space"—the former representing dependent dimensions within Absolute, the latter the mistaken view of independent containers.

Scriptural foundations include Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.3.6 ("beyond hunger and thirst, beyond sorrow, beyond time and space") and Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.19 on transcendence. Vivekananda's Jnana Yoga extensively analyzes these texts while engaging Spencer's evolutionary philosophy and contemporary physics.

Internal variation within Neo-Vedanta ranges from strict Advaitins denying space-time's conventional reality to liberal modernizers fully accepting scientific cosmology's independent validity. Vivekananda attempted middle path validating both.

Materialist critics argue that claiming space-time dependence on consciousness contradicts evolutionary evidence of consciousness emerging within space-time. Vivekananda responded through his involution-evolution theory: consciousness involutes into matter before evolving back, with space-time representing the involutionary framework.

Contemporary relevance includes Vivekananda's anticipation of relativity through emphasis on space-time relativity and observer-dependence. His Chicago lectures (1893) presciently suggested that advanced physics would discover space-time's non-absolute nature, partially validated by Einstein's 1905-1915 work.

Comparatively, Vivekananda mediates between traditional Advaita's world-negation and Western scientific realism. Unlike Ramanuja's attributing qualified reality to creation, or pure Advaitins denying conventional validity, Neo-Vedanta grants epistemic significance to empirical space-time while maintaining ontological dependence. This position influenced virtually all subsequent Hindu modernist movements, from Aurobindo to contemporary Hindu-physics dialogues.

*** 1.19.146 Aurobindo Integral Yoga Response

Space and time exist as real dimensions of manifestation proceeding from Sat-Chit-Ananda (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss) through graded involution and evolution, according to Sri Aurobindo's (1872-1950) Integral Yoga and the philosophy systematized in "The Life Divine" (1914-1919), "The Synthesis of Yoga" (1914-1921), and elaborated by The Mother (Mirra Alfassa, 1878-1973). This evolutionary Vedanta presents a unique position: space-time possesses genuine reality as divine self-manifestation rather than illusion (maya), while remaining dependent on supracosmic Reality beyond spatiotemporal categories.

Aurobindo's philosophical framework involves "double movement"—involution of consciousness into matter creating space-time dimensions, and evolution of consciousness through matter transforming these dimensions. Unlike classical Advaita denying creation's reality, Integral Yoga affirms space-time as divine self-objectification. The technical terminology includes "supermind" (vijnana) as intermediate principle between Sat-Chit-Ananda and space-time manifestation, with space-time emerging through supermind's self-determining power. Aurobindo distinguishes between "timeless Eternal" (kala-atita) and "sempiternal" (perpetual existence in time)—both real but different modalities. His innovation involves "temporal" and "spatial" consciousness as actual divine attributes, not mere illusions.

Scriptural interpretation emphasizes Isha Upanishad's affirmation of manifestation's reality and Taittiriya Upanishad's evolutionary emergence from Brahman. Aurobindo's Gita commentary interprets Krishna's "I am Time" (kalo'smi) literally—divine reality expressing as temporal dimension, not merely appearing as time.

Significant internal debate exists between followers emphasizing transcendence beyond space-time versus immanence transforming space-time. Later Aurobindonian thought increasingly stressed material transformation, with The Mother's "Agenda" (1951-1973) exploring "cellular consciousness" potentially transcending physical space-time limitations while remaining embodied.

Classical Advaitins object that granting reality to space-time contradicts non-dualism. Aurobindo responded that non-dualism need not mean non-differentiation—unity can manifest as real multiplicity without losing essential oneness.

Contemporary applications include extensive engagement with evolution, relativity, and quantum physics. Aurobindo anticipated multiple dimensions beyond conventional space-time, suggesting supermind operates through different spatiotemporal frameworks. The Auroville experiment represents practical application—creating community embodying transformed space-time consciousness.

Comparatively, Integral Yoga diverges radically from traditional Advaita by affirming creation's genuine reality, closer to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita but with evolutionary dynamism absent in classical Vedanta. Unlike Western process theology, consciousness remains ontologically prior while validating space-time's authentic existence. The synthesis of Vedantic transcendence with evolutionary immanence creates unique position influencing Teilhard de Chardin comparisons and contemporary consciousness-evolution dialogues.

*** 1.19.147 Mother Meera Response

Space and time exist as manifestations of the Divine Light and do not possess independence from the Supreme Reality, according to Mother Meera's (b. 1960) teachings and the devotional practice centered at Schaumburg, Germany since 1982. This contemporary avatar-based tradition, though minimally discursive compared to philosophical schools, articulates through darshan sessions and "Answers" compilations (1991, 2002) a position where space-time represents veils or layers through which divine light and grace operate. The tradition's metaphysics developed through Mother Meera's responses to written questions, emphasizing experiential realization over systematic cosmology.

The philosophical framework, insofar as systematized, draws on Aurobindo's Integral Yoga (Mother Meera's early connection to Aurobindo Ashram through adoptive uncle Reddy) while centering on Paramatman light (supreme divine light) as fundamental reality from which space-time dimensions emerge. Mother Meera's distinctive contribution involves emphasis on "Light" as primary ontological category—space-time exists as progressively dense crystallizations of Light-consciousness. Her practice of "pranam" (darshan with head-holding) reportedly works on "subtle body" levels transcending physical space-time while remaining connected to it. The teaching maintains that divine consciousness exists beyond spatial limitation and temporal succession, yet works through these dimensions for transformation.

Scriptural reference remains implicit rather than explicit, though the tradition's Vedantic background suggests alignment with Upanishadic formulations of light-metaphysics (jyotir brahman). Mother Meera's statement that "the Divine is beyond time and space but can be experienced within them" encapsulates the position.

Minimal internal variation exists given the tradition's non-discursive nature and Mother Meera's consistent emphasis on silent transmission over doctrinal elaboration. However, followers range from devotional practitioners unconcerned with cosmology to philosophically-inclined students attempting systematic frameworks.

Materialist critiques question claims of spatial-temporal transcendence without empirical verification. The tradition typically does not engage such objections, maintaining that direct experience through darshan provides sufficient validation.

Contemporary application focuses primarily on individual transformation rather than cosmological speculation. However, the international character of the tradition (centers across Europe, North America, Asia) embodies teaching about consciousness transcending spatial separation while working through physical locations.

Comparatively, Mother Meera's position aligns broadly with avatar-centric traditions (Sathya Sai, Amma) emphasizing divine transcendence-immanence regarding space-time, while distinguished by remarkable non-verbal approach. Unlike systematically articulated philosophies, this tradition maintains that silence communicates truth about space-time's relationship to ultimate reality more effectively than concepts. The light-centered metaphysics shares elements with Kashmir Shaivism's prakasha (luminosity) doctrine while avoiding technical elaboration.

*** 1.19.148 Krishnamurti Foundation Response

Space and time as ordinarily conceived constitute psychological constructs created by thought's movement rather than independent realities, according to Jiddu Krishnamurti's (1895-1986) teachings preserved through Krishnamurti Foundation publications and extensive recorded dialogues from 1930s-1980s. This radically non-traditional approach, explicitly rejecting all authority and systems, presents a phenomenological analysis where space-time represents thought's activity of division, measurement, and becoming rather than objective dimensions. Krishnamurti's position crystallized particularly in works like "Freedom from the Known" (1969), "The First and Last Freedom" (1954), and dialogues with physicist David Bohm exploring consciousness and physics (1960s-1980s).

The philosophical framework emphasizes observation without the observer—a state where thought's space-time creation ceases. Krishnamurti employs "psychological time" (past-future movement creating continuity) versus "chronological time" (practical sequential ordering). He argues that while chronological time serves functional purposes, psychological time—the self-perpetuating narrative creating past and projecting future—generates illusory space-time framework causing suffering. The technical terminology includes "thought-time" and "interval" (the gap between observer and observed creating spatial separation). In timeless awareness, spatial and temporal divisions dissolve not into mystical unity but into immediate perception without mediation.

Krishnamurti rarely cited traditional scriptures, viewing them as impediments to direct perception. However, his approach resonates with Buddhist concepts of momentariness (kshanika-vada) and Advaita's subject-object non-duality, though he rejected these frameworks as systems.

Significant internal debate exists between interpreters emphasizing psychological versus ontological dimensions. Some view Krishnamurti as addressing only mental time-construction, while others argue he addressed space-time's fundamental nature. His dialogues with Bohm explored whether quantum physics' implicate order suggested space-time's derivative status.

Scientific realists argue that physics demonstrates space-time's mind-independence. Krishnamurti's response distinguished between physical measurements (functional) and the psychologically-created sense of past-future determining present experience.

Contemporary relevance appears in cognitive science research on time perception and constructed nature of temporal experience. Krishnamurti's analysis influenced various mindfulness and awareness movements, though often simplified.

Comparatively, this position resembles phenomenological reduction more than traditional Indian cosmology. Unlike Vedantic brahman-based ontologies, Buddhist momentariness doctrines, or devotional divine-time frameworks, Krishnamurti's approach remains steadfastly anti-metaphysical. The emphasis on observation without observer distinguishes his teaching from meditation practices accepting space-time framework for transformation. The extensive physics dialogues represent unique contribution exploring whether quantum mechanics and relativity support view of thought-created space-time, positioning this teaching at intersection of phenomenology, philosophy of mind, and physics.

*** 1.19.149 Sathya Sai Organization Response

Space and time exist as relative manifestations within divine consciousness, lacking independent existence apart from the Supreme Being who transcends yet pervades all spatiotemporal dimensions, according to the Sathya Sai Organization's systematic theology based on Sathya Sai Baba's teachings (1926-2011). This global movement, formalized through Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust and international councils from 1960s onward, presents an integrative framework synthesizing Advaita Vedanta's non-dualism with devotional theism's personal God conception. The philosophical position developed through Sathya Sai's extensive discourse series including "Summer Showers in Brindavan" (1972-2000), "Sathya Sai Speaks" (30 volumes, 1953-2011), and "Vahini" (spiritual stream) series elucidating Vedantic concepts with contemporary applications.

The theological framework employs tripartite reality structure: Sat-Chit-Ananda (absolute transcending space-time), Hiranyagarbha (cosmic consciousness containing space-time potentials), and Virat (manifested universe expressing space-time actuality). Sathya Sai's teaching emphasizes that Parabrahman exists as "Desha-Kala-Nimitta-atita" (beyond space, time, and causation) while simultaneously being "Sarva-vyapi" (all-pervading) and "Nitya" (eternal-present). This paradox resolves through understanding space-time as divine lila (play) or projection—real as manifestation, unreal as independent entities. The technical innovation involves relating quantum physics' observer-effects to consciousness-primacy, suggesting measurement creates space-time actuality from consciousness-possibilities.

Scriptural foundations include Bhagavad Gita 9.4-5 where Krishna describes pervading cosmos while remaining transcendent, Purusha Sukta's cosmogonic account, and Upanishadic mahavakyas (great statements) indicating identity beyond space-time. Sathya Sai's interpretations emphasize that "Tat Tvam Asi" (Thou art That) dissolves spatial separation between individual and ultimate.

Internal variations exist between devotional practitioners emphasizing Sai's personal interventions transcending space-time (bilocation accounts, simultaneous appearances) and philosophically-oriented followers focusing on Advaitic metaphysics. Educational institutions (Sri Sathya Sai University campuses) attempt systematic integration of perspectives.

Rationalist critics challenge claimed spatial-temporal transcendence as empirically unverifiable. The Organization responds that limited human perception cannot judge transcendent realities, while pointing to quantum non-locality as suggestive evidence.

Contemporary applications include educational curricula integrating Vedantic cosmology with modern physics, exploring whether consciousness-based quantum interpretations align with Sathya Sai's teachings. Service projects worldwide embody teaching that spatial separation represents illusion overcome through love-based unity consciousness.

Comparatively, this position resembles Ramakrishna Mission's balanced approach while maintaining stronger avatar-centered focus. Unlike purely non-dualistic traditions denying personality's ultimate reality, Sathya Sai theology preserves divine personhood transcending space-time, closer to Chaitanya's achintya-bheda-abheda (inconceivable difference-non-difference). The integration of devotional practice with Advaitic philosophy distinguishes this from either purely jnana-based or bhakti-based traditions.

*** 1.19.150 Chinmaya Mission Response

Space and time exist as conditioned reality (vyavaharika satya) dependent on unconditioned Brahman-consciousness, possessing conventional validity while lacking absolute independence, according to Chinmaya Mission's educational Vedanta founded by Swami Chinmayananda (1916-1993). This influential teaching movement, established in 1953 and systematized through extensive Upanishadic and Bhagavad Gita commentaries, presents classical Advaita Vedanta with emphasis on rational exposition and contemporary accessibility. The philosophical position developed through Chinmayananda's "Self-Unfoldment" (1987), Upanishad commentary series (1950s-1990s), and successor swamis' works, particularly Swami Tejomayananda's and Swami Swaroopananda's systematic presentations (1990s-2020s).

The pedagogical framework employs Shankara's tri-level reality analysis with educational precision: Paramarthika satya (absolute reality—Brahman beyond space-time), Vyavaharika satya (empirical reality—space-time as valid conventions), and Pratibhasika satya (illusory reality—space-time misperceptions). Chinmayananda's distinctive contribution involves methodical progression from gross to subtle: physical space-time (sthula-desha-kala), mental space-time (sukshma-desha-kala), and causal potentials (karana-bija) all resolving into limitless awareness (aparicchinna-chaitanya). The technical exposition employs rope-snake analogy: just as snake-perception depends on rope-substrate, space-time appearances depend on Brahman-substrate. The term "mithya" (dependent reality) indicates space-time's status—neither absolutely real nor entirely unreal, but dependently real.

Scriptural authority derives from Shankara's bhashyas (commentaries), particularly on Mandukya Upanishad's analysis of consciousness-states and Chandogya Upanishad's creation accounts. Chinmayananda's Bhagavad Gita commentary emphasizes Krishna's description as "Kala" (Time, 11.32) not as temporal succession but as consciousness-principle manifesting as time.

Internal variations remain minimal given the Mission's educational systematization, though teaching approaches range from strictly traditional (Swami Brahmananda) to contemporary-scientific (Swami Mitrananda). The latter explores quantum physics parallels, while traditionalists emphasize scriptural precision.

Scientific objections regarding consciousness-dependence meet responses distinguishing epistemological from ontological claims: space-time appears within awareness (epistemology) and depends on awareness for existence (ontology), with meditation experience as verification.

Contemporary applications include Chinmaya International Foundation's research publications exploring Vedantic cosmology and modern physics, particularly investigating whether quantum field theory's vacuum state resembles akasha concept, and whether relativity's space-time fabric aligns with maya's dependent-reality status. Educational programs (Chinmaya Vidyalayas) integrate traditional and scientific cosmology.

Comparatively, Chinmaya Mission represents mainstream Advaita Vedanta applied educationally, closer to Shankara's systematic approach than experiential-mystical lineages (Ramana, Nisargadatta). Unlike Neo-Vedantic movements significantly modifying tradition for Western audiences, Chinmaya Mission maintains classical positions while employing contemporary language. The emphasis on intellectual clarity and logical exposition distinguishes this educational mission from devotional movements, making it particularly influential in Hindu diaspora communities seeking systematic philosophical understanding.
