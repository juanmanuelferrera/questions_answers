*** 1.4.61 Sabbatean Judaism Response

Sabbatean Judaism presents a paradoxical understanding of causation rooted in the radical messianic theology of Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), where divine causation operates through deliberate violation of traditional norms to hasten redemption. The movement maintains that causation functions in a suspended ethical framework during the messianic era, where conventional chains of cause and effect are inverted through sacred transgression.

The theological foundation emerged with Sabbatai Zevi's self-proclamation as messiah in 1665-1666, elaborated systematically by Nathan of Gaza (1643-1680), who developed the concept that the messiah's apostasy to Islam was itself a causative act of cosmic repair (tikkun). Abraham Miguel Cardozo (1626-1706) further theorized that causation in the messianic age operates through birur ha-nitzotzot (raising sparks) accomplished paradoxically through descent into kelipot (husks of evil). This reversal of causation appears in Nathan's Treatise on the Dragons (Derush ha-Tanninim, 1666), which describes how the messiah must enter into the realm of impurity to extract holy sparks.

Central to Sabbatean causation theory is the concept that God causes events through contradictory manifestations—the messiah both upholds and violates Torah as causative necessity. The tradition cites Psalms 50:16 ("But unto the wicked God says, What have you to do to declare My statutes?") as prophetic indication that messianic causation transcends conventional morality. Sabbateans interpret Isaiah 53's suffering servant as demonstrating that redemption is caused precisely through apparent degradation.

Key arguments include: (1) Linear causation is suspended during liminal messianic periods, replaced by paradoxical causation where descent causes ascent; (2) Human actions become co-causative with divine will when performed in messianic consciousness, justifying antinomian practices as causally efficacious for redemption; (3) Suffering and apostasy function as necessary causal intermediaries in cosmic restoration.

Internal tensions emerged between moderate Sabbateans who maintained hidden observance and radical variants embracing open transgression. Critics from rabbinic orthodoxy, particularly Jacob Emden (1697-1776), argued this causation theory enabled immoral behavior without genuine metaphysical foundation.

Contemporary scholarship by Gershom Scholem demonstrates how Sabbatean causation theory influenced later Jewish mysticism and potentially early Hasidic thought. The paradoxical causation bears structural similarity to Gnostic systems where knowledge causes salvation through inverting conventional religious categories, and to antinomian strands in Christianity where grace supersedes law as primary causative principle in salvation.

*** 1.4.62 Frankist Judaism Response

Frankist Judaism, following Jacob Frank (1726-1791), articulates an extreme dualistic causation where the true hidden God operates through causes that appear evil to conventional perception, requiring systematic transgression to activate redemptive causation. This tradition posits that causation in the visible world is governed by the demiurgic "Big Brother," while authentic causation flows from the concealed deity accessible only through ritual violation.

Frank's teaching evolved from Sabbatean roots after his 1755 revelations, crystallized during the disputations at Kamieniec (1757) and Lvov (1759), and preserved in the Słowa Pańskie (The Words of the Lord, recorded 1790-1791). Unlike his Sabbatean predecessors, Frank explicitly identified two causative principles: the inferior creator-god of Jewish law whose causation produces bondage, and the supreme hidden God whose causation liberates through destruction of existing order. His follower Moses Dobruška (1753-1794) theorized that causation operates through deliberate contamination—entering Christianity while maintaining inner nihilism causes breakthrough to higher reality.

The Frankist causation framework draws from Genesis 1:1, interpreted as revealing multiplicity of causative powers rather than single creator. Frank taught that Esau's blessing (Genesis 27) demonstrates superior causative power flowing through transgressive channels. The tradition reinterprets Job 28:7 ("There is a path which no fowl knows") as referring to hidden causative pathways accessible only through violation of conventional religion.

Three core arguments structure Frankist causation: (1) Visible causation represents a false system maintained by the demiurge; true causation requires destruction of existing structures through sacred antinomianism; (2) Conversion itself (first to Islam for Sabbateans, then to Catholicism for Frankists) functions as causative mechanism to access hidden divine power; (3) Sexual transgression specifically disrupts false causative chains and opens channels to authentic divine causation.

Internal variations ranged from those maintaining covert Jewish identity to complete assimilation. The radical trinity doctrine (Frank, his daughter Eve, and hidden God) created causative hierarchy foreign to Judaism.

Critics, including contemporary rabbinical authorities, condemned this as nihilistic destruction of ethical causation. Pawel Maciejko's historical research reveals how Frankist causation influenced Central European esoteric movements. The system parallels Gnostic demiurgic causation theories and Manichaean dualistic causality, while inverting Pauline theology's tension between law and grace into systematic antinomianism.

*** 1.4.63 Dönmeh Response

The Dönmeh tradition, emerging from Ottoman Sabbatean communities after Sabbatai Zevi's 1666 conversion to Islam, developed a syncretic causation theory where divine action operates simultaneously through Islamic, Jewish, and messianic principles in complementary rather than contradictory fashion. Causation functions through concealment—outward Islamic observance serves as necessary causal medium for inner messianic transformation accessible only to initiated believers.

The tradition crystallized into three main sects by the 18th century: the Izmirli following Sabbatai Zevi's original path, the Jakubi founded by Jacob Querido (d. 1690) who claimed to be Sabbatai's incarnation, and the Karakaş emphasizing mystical practice. Osman Baba (Berekhiah Russo, d. 1720) systematized Dönmeh causation theology in his Sefer ha-Zekhut, arguing that causation operates through concealment—the very act of hiding messianic identity causes cosmic repair because it embeds holiness within the kelipah of Islam. Later thinkers like Derviş Mehmed Efendi (18th century) integrated Sufi concepts of divine causation through emanation with Kabbalistic theories of tzimtzum (divine contraction).

Dönmeh causation draws from Sabbatai's interpretation of Isaiah 53:3 ("despised and rejected") as indicating the messiah's caused humiliation serves redemptive purpose. They cite Deuteronomy 30:11-14 to argue that causative power resides not in external law but in internal transformation. Quranic verses on taqiyya (protective dissimulation) are reinterpreted as validating concealment as causative mechanism for spiritual development.

Three philosophical arguments ground their causation theory: (1) External religious forms function as causative vessels (kelim) that channel divine energy; conversion to Islam doesn't nullify but redirects causative spiritual power; (2) Dual observance creates causative synergy—performing Islamic practice externally while maintaining Sabbatean mysticism internally generates unique redemptive causation unavailable through either tradition alone; (3) Genealogical causation through endogamous marriage preserves and transmits messianic consciousness across generations as biological-spiritual causative chain.

Internal variations existed between literalist and mystical interpretations of how conversion causes redemption. The Karakaş emphasized individual spiritual causation while Izmirli maintained collective causation through community preservation.

Contemporary scholarship by Marc Baer examines how Dönmeh navigated causation in modernizing Ottoman Empire. Their hidden causation parallels Ismaili taqiyya practices and crypto-Jewish communities, while maintaining distinctly messianic causation theory where concealment itself possesses redemptive causal efficacy unavailable to open religious practice.

*** 1.4.64 Jewish Renewal Response

Jewish Renewal articulates an eco-spiritual, neo-Hasidic understanding of causation where divine creative energy continuously flows through nested systems of consciousness, personal action, and environmental interconnection, requiring human partnership to direct causative flows toward healing (tikkun olam). The movement integrates traditional Kabbalistic causation with contemporary systems thinking, ecology, and participatory spirituality.

Founded by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (1924-2014) in the 1960s-1970s, drawing from his Lubavitch Hasidic training combined with encounter with diverse spiritual traditions, the movement developed distinctive causation theology through works like Paradigm Shift (1993) and Wrapped in a Holy Flame (2003). Arthur Green (b. 1941) contributed philosophical rigor in Radical Judaism (2010), articulating panentheistic causation where God functions as the singular causal force manifesting through infinite particular causes. Rabbi Marcia Prager (b. 1945) emphasized feminine dimensions of causation through Shekhinah consciousness in The Path of Blessing (2003).

Jewish Renewal causation roots in Lurianic Kabbalah's concepts of tzimtzum (divine contraction enabling finite causation), shevirat ha-kelim (breaking of vessels creating fragmented causation), and tikkun (repair through redirected causative action). However, they reinterpret these mythically as describing psychological and ecological rather than cosmological causation. Genesis 1:1 is read as continuous present tense: God continuously causes existence at each moment. Deuteronomy 30:19 ("I have set before you life and death") emphasizes human causative agency as divine partnership.

Core arguments include: (1) Causation flows through interconnected systems; individual actions cause ripple effects through spiritual, social, and ecological networks simultaneously (networked causation); (2) Consciousness participates in causation—mindful intention (kavanah) directs how divine energy causes effects in world; meditation and prayer function as causative practices; (3) Environmental causation reflects divine immanence; ecological degradation results from disrupted causative flows requiring repair through sustainable practices aligned with divine creative causation.

Internal variations span from Green's philosophical naturalism, where causation operates through emergent natural processes as divine self-expression, to more theistic versions maintaining supernatural causative intervention while emphasizing human partnership.

Critics from Orthodox Judaism question whether panentheistic causation preserves divine transcendence and sovereignty. Some argue ecological focus dilutes theological specificity.

Contemporary Renewal communities apply causation theory through contemplative practice combined with social justice activism, viewing both as causative mechanisms for tikkun. The approach parallels process theology's participatory causation, Buddhist dependent origination applied ecologically, and panentheistic Christian movements, while maintaining distinctly Jewish textual and liturgical framework.

*** 1.4.65 Neo-Hasidism Response

Neo-Hasidism presents a theologically liberal yet spiritually intensive causation theory recovering classical Hasidic panentheism while rejecting supernatural intervention, arguing that divine causation operates continuously through natural processes that human consciousness can recognize and align with through contemplative practice and ethical action. Causation functions non-dualistically—every cause is simultaneously natural and divine, mundane and sacred.

The movement crystallized through Martin Buber's (1878-1965) early 20th century recovery of Hasidic teachings in works like Tales of the Hasidim (1947-1948), though his existentialist interpretation differed from contemporary Neo-Hasidism. Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) contributed sophisticated causation theology in God in Search of Man (1955), articulating divine pathos where God both causes history and responds to human action in dynamic reciprocal causation. Arthur Green synthesized these streams in works like Seek My Face (2003) and A Guide to the Zohar (2004), developing evolutionary panentheistic causation where divine creativity causes universe's unfolding through emergent natural processes.

Neo-Hasidic causation draws deeply from the Maggid of Mezeritch's (1704-1772) teaching that "There is no place devoid of Him"—all causation is divine causation appearing through particular natural mechanisms. The Ba'al Shem Tov's (1698-1760) concept of hashgachah pratit (divine providence in every detail) is reinterpreted naturalistically: not supernatural intervention but recognition that every causal event contains divine significance. Psalm 145:18 ("The Lord is near to all who call upon Him") indicates divine causation's accessibility through consciousness rather than spatial proximity.

Three arguments structure Neo-Hasidic causation: (1) Panentheistic non-dual causation—God doesn't cause nature separately but through nature; recognizing divine causation means perceiving depth dimension in natural causes; (2) Consciousness participates in causation not supernaturally but by directing attention and intention; kavanah (focused intention) shapes how we receive and respond to causative flows; (3) Evolutionary causation—universe's development from simplicity toward complexity and consciousness manifests divine creative causation; human ethical and spiritual development continues this causative trajectory.

Internal variations range from Buber's existentialist focus on I-Thou encounter as primary causative moment, to Heschel's maintaining divine pathos and revelation as special causative events, to Green's more naturalistic reading where all causation is divine creative process.

Orthodox critics argue this dissolves traditional theology into naturalism. Some question whether naturalized causation preserves meaningful prayer or providence.

Contemporary Neo-Hasidic communities integrate this causation understanding through contemplative practice, ecstatic prayer, and social justice work, viewing spiritual practice as cultivating awareness of divine causation rather than invoking supernatural causes. The position parallels process theology's dipolar causation, Spinoza's natura naturans, and contemporary religious naturalism, while maintaining distinctly Hasidic devotional and mystical framework.

*** 1.4.66 Gnosticism (Christian) Response

Christian Gnosticism articulates a complex dualistic causation where the supreme unknowable God did not create the material world; instead, a flawed demiurgic power causes material existence through ignorance or malice, while the true God causes salvation through gnosis (revealed knowledge) transmitted by Christ as divine emissary. Material causation operates through deterministic archonic powers, while spiritual causation flows from transcendent divine realm through revelation.

The tradition crystallized in 2nd century CE through teachers like Valentinus (c. 100-160 CE), who developed sophisticated emanationist causation theory, and Basilides (early 2nd century), who proposed 365 emanated heavens with the Jewish God as lowest creative power. The Gospel of Thomas (c. 50-140 CE) presents Jesus teaching that self-knowledge causes liberation: "If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you" (Saying 70). The Apocryphon of John (2nd century) provides comprehensive Gnostic cosmogony where Sophia's presumptuous desire causes the demiurge's generation, whose ignorant activity causes material world's formation.

Christian Gnostic causation interprets John 1:1-3 as describing true divine creative causation through Logos, while material creation results from Sophia's fall. Genesis 1 is reread as describing not supreme God's creation but demiurge's fashioning of prison for divine sparks. John 8:44 ("You are of your father the devil") indicates dual causative lineage—material ancestry from demiurge, spiritual ancestry from true God.

Core arguments include: (1) Moral and natural evil proves supreme God didn't cause material world; a perfect cause cannot produce imperfect effect; material causation must originate from flawed power; (2) Human consciousness experiences tension between body (caused by demiurge) and spirit (caused by true God), evidencing dual causative origin; (3) Knowledge causes salvation—gnosis doesn't result from good works or faith alone but from revealed understanding that disrupts archonic causative control over soul.

Internal variations ranged from moderate systems (Valentinian) maintaining material world as correctable error to radical dualism (some Sethian texts) viewing matter as evil requiring destruction. Some systems proposed Christ's appearance was docetic (apparent not real body) to avoid contamination by material causation.

Orthodox Christian critics, particularly Irenaeus in Against Heresies (180 CE), argued this denigrated creation and denied incarnation's reality. Gnostic causation made biblical creator into villain, contradicting Christian monotheism.

Contemporary scholarship by Elaine Pagels demonstrates Gnostic causation's sophisticated response to theodicy problem. The framework parallels Manichaean dualism, Platonic demiurge theory, and anticipates some modern idealist philosophies, while uniquely identifying Jewish creator-God with subordinate causative power and Christ with revelation disrupting material causation.

*** 1.4.67 Gnosticism (Non-Christian) Response

Non-Christian Gnosticism presents diverse dualistic causation frameworks where material existence results from cosmic error, divine emanation gone awry, or malevolent creation, while true reality consists of transcendent pleroma (fullness) from which salvation-causing gnosis emanates. Causation operates on multiple levels: material causation through archons and demiurgic powers, psychic causation through soul, and pneumatic (spiritual) causation from supreme unknowable divinity.

Foundational systems include Simonian Gnosticism attributed to Simon Magus (1st century CE), teaching that the supreme Power caused emanations, the lowest of which created and now imprisons souls in matter. The Hermetic texts (2nd-3rd centuries CE), particularly Poimandres, describe causation through divine Mind generating Logos, which causes ordered cosmos, while human redemption is caused by ascending through spheres to original divine source. Mandaean tradition (possibly pre-Christian origins, developed 2nd-7th centuries) maintains elaborate causation mythology where Life (Hiia) causes manda (knowledge) to descend from World of Light, enabling souls to escape causation-bound material realm created by Ptahil.

Non-Christian Gnostic causation draws from Platonic philosophical heritage, interpreting Timaeus' demiurge as literal inferior creative cause. The "Unknown God" Paul references in Acts 17:23 is identified as true supreme causative principle beyond the creator-god of Judaism. Various systems cite orphic and Pythagorean teachings on soul's imprisonment in body caused by primordial fall.

Core causation arguments include: (1) Graduated ontological levels require corresponding causative hierarchies—supreme God causes highest emanations; intermediate powers cause psychic realm; lowest powers cause matter; (2) Material causation operates mechanistically through deterministic archonic powers (heimarmene/fate); spiritual causation operates through knowledge-transmission breaking deterministic chains; (3) The body-soul dualism humans experience evidences dual causative origin; material body is caused by archons, divine spark by supreme God through emanational causation.

Significant internal variation exists between Iranian-influenced systems emphasizing radical dualism (matter caused by evil principle) versus Hellenistic-influenced systems viewing material causation as error or necessary but inferior stage. Some systems (Hermetic) maintain material world as potentially positive if understood correctly, while others (Manichaean-influenced) view it as irredeemably evil in its causation.

Critics within philosophical Platonism, like Plotinus in Enneads (3rd century), argued against degrading material creation and defended demiurge as beneficial causative principle. Jewish and Christian authorities condemned the theology as blasphemous corruption.

Contemporary religious studies scholars like Kurt Rudolph identify non-Christian Gnosticism's Persian, Babylonian, and Greek philosophical causation sources. The framework parallels Buddhist analysis of samsara (causally conditioned existence) requiring escape through knowledge, Platonic causation hierarchy, and prefigures some idealist metaphysics, while maintaining distinctive mythology of cosmic fall and archonic causation.

*** 1.4.68 Valentinianism Response

Valentinianism, the most philosophically sophisticated Christian Gnostic system, articulates an elegant emanationist causation where the supreme unknowable Father causes all reality through progressive emanations (the Pleroma of thirty aeons), but material creation results from Sophia's passion causing the demiurge's generation, whose ignorant activity produces deficient material causation. Salvation is caused by Christ-Logos restoring knowledge of true causative hierarchy, enabling souls to return through causal chain to ultimate source.

Founded by Valentinus (c. 100-160 CE), who taught in Rome and nearly became bishop, the system was elaborated by Ptolemy (mid-2nd century) in his Letter to Flora and Epistle to Rheginus, and by Heracleon (mid-2nd century) in his Commentary on John—the first Christian biblical commentary. The Gospel of Truth (mid-2nd century), possibly by Valentinus, describes causation poetically: "Error became powerful; it worked on its own matter in an empty way, not having known the truth." The Tripartite Tractate (late 2nd-3rd century) provides detailed emanation causality where Logos causes organization while Sophia's solo creative attempt causes disorder.

Valentinian causation creatively interprets John 1:1-18 as describing emanational causation from Father through progressive manifestations. Genesis 1:1-2 describes not supreme God but demiurge working with formless matter caused by Sophia's passion. John 14:6 ("I am the way, the truth, and the life") indicates Christ as causative principle restoring broken causal connection between material and divine realms.

Four key arguments structure Valentinian causation: (1) Perfect unity causes reality through syzygy (paired emanations) maintaining balance; material world's imperfection results from Sophia's asymmetrical causation attempting creation without consort; (2) Triple human constitution (material, psychic, pneumatic) reflects triple causative origin—material from demiurge, psychic from Sophia, pneumatic from Pleroma; (3) Christ causes salvation not by atonement but by revealing true causative structure; gnosis itself functions as causative power reintegrating fragmented consciousness; (4) Resurrection occurs spiritually, not materially, as pneumatic element recognizes causative origin and returns to Pleroma, liberated from material causation.

Internal Valentinian variations included Eastern school emphasizing Christ's substantial causative reality versus Western school's more docetic interpretation. Debates concerned whether material creation is inherently evil (requiring destruction) or correctable through gnosis.

Orthodox critics, particularly Irenaeus in Against Heresies Book I, systematically refuted Valentinian causation as contradicting biblical monotheism and making salvation depend on esoteric knowledge rather than faith and grace. Tertullian argued the emanation causality was arbitrary mythology.

Contemporary scholarship by Elaine Pagels and Christoph Markschies demonstrates Valentinian causation's philosophical sophistication, attempting to reconcile Platonic emanationism with Christian revelation. The system parallels Neoplatonic hypostases (One, Nous, Soul) as causative hierarchy and process theology's dipolar God, while uniquely identifying creative activity itself as result of divine disruption requiring restoration.

*** 1.4.69 Sethianism Response

Sethian Gnosticism presents a radical dualistic causation where the supreme unknowable Invisible Spirit causes reality through emanations of divine attributes, but material creation results from Sophia's presumptuous attempt to create alone, producing the monstrous demiurge Yaldabaoth whose ignorant causative activity imprisons divine light in matter. Seth, third son of Adam, represents the pure divine lineage through which salvific gnosis causes liberation from demiurgic causation.

The tradition appears in texts from Nag Hammadi library (2nd-4th centuries CE), particularly the Apocryphon of John (c. 180 CE), which provides comprehensive cosmogony where Barbelo (first emanation) causes subsequent divine powers through thought-causation, while Sophia's solitary thought causes malformed creator-god. The Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit (3rd century) describes how Seth causes preservation of gnosis through successive generations. Zostrianos (mid-3rd century) presents elaborate causation metaphysics of graduated divine levels influencing Neoplatonic philosophy. Allogenes (3rd century) emphasizes negative theology—supreme causative principle is unknowable, beyond being itself.

Sethian causation radically reinterprets Genesis: the serpent in Genesis 3 causes enlightenment not sin, revealing Yaldabaoth's deception; Eve receives Zoe (Life) from Sophia, causing spiritual awakening; Seth (Genesis 4:25) carries uncorrupted divine causation lineage. Genesis 1:26 ("Let us make man") reveals multiple causative powers; Yaldabaoth ignorantly imitates divine creative causation. John 8:44 indicates the biblical "God" (Yaldabaoth) is liar from beginning.

Core causation arguments include: (1) Radical unknowability of supreme cause—the Invisible Spirit transcends being/non-being dichotomy; all cataphatic descriptions apply only to emanations, not ultimate causative source; (2) Knowledge-transmission functions as causative mechanism independent of belief or ethics; baptismal rituals cause gnosis by reconnecting soul with causative origin; (3) The "living Jesus" causes salvation by revealing humans' true causative origin beyond material creation; (4) Apocalyptic determinism—archons cause material events deterministically; only pneumatic souls possess capacity for liberation-causation through gnosis.

Internal variations concerned number and names of aeons (causative emanations), role of Christ versus Seth as primary revealer, and degree of material world's inherent evil. Some texts emphasize ascent through spheres as causal process; others focus on instantaneous gnosis.

Orthodox Christians condemned Sethian theology as blasphemous inversion of Genesis, making villain into hero. The portrayal of biblical God as ignorant demiurge fundamentally contradicted Christian monotheism.

Contemporary scholarship by John D. Turner and Birger Pearson demonstrates Sethian causation's Platonic philosophical sophistication and possible Jewish apocalyptic roots. The framework parallels Zoroastrian dualism's cosmic conflict, Buddhist analysis of ignorance causing samsara, and anticipates some existentialist themes of authentic versus inauthentic existence, while maintaining distinctive mythology of archonic causation and baptismal gnosis as liberating causative mechanism.

*** 1.4.70 Marcionism Response

Marcionism articulates a stark dualistic causation where the Old Testament creator-God (demiurge) causes the material world and enforces justice through law, while the previously unknown supreme Good God, revealed by Jesus, causes salvation through pure grace independent of creation. These represent two entirely separate causative principles—one creating and judging, the other redeeming through unmotivated mercy.

Founded by Marcion of Sinope (c. 85-160 CE), a wealthy shipowner who came to Rome around 140 CE and developed his theology systematically, influenced by Pauline emphasis on law versus grace. Marcion composed the Antitheses (c. 144 CE, surviving only in refutations) contrasting the creator-God's causation through justice with the Good God's causation through mercy. He created the first Christian canon (c. 144 CE), including only edited Luke and ten Pauline letters, excluding all material connecting Jesus to Old Testament creative causation. Apelles (late 2nd century), Marcion's prominent follower, modified the system arguing one supreme God with inferior angel causing creation.

Marcionite causation interprets Paul's distinction between law and grace (Romans 3:21-28, Galatians 3:10-14) as revealing two Gods with separate causative operations. The creator-God causes through "an eye for eye" (Exodus 21:24); the Good God causes through "turn the other cheek" (Luke 6:29)—these contradictory causative principles require separate sources. Luke 6:43 ("good tree cannot bear evil fruit") proves the flawed creation cannot be caused by supremely good God. Jesus states "No one knows the Father" (Matthew 11:27) because the Good God was previously unknown, distinct from creation's cause.

Four arguments ground Marcionite causation: (1) Material world's inherent flaws (disease, death, suffering) prove it cannot be caused by perfect good God; justice itself as retributive causation is inferior to grace as pure gift-causation; (2) Old Testament God causes through material blessings/curses, warfare, and law; Good God causes salvation purely spiritually without material involvement; (3) Jesus appeared suddenly without birth narrative (docetism) because he originates from different causative principle than material creation; incarnation would contaminate him with inferior creator's causation; (4) Human nature is caused by demiurge and therefore inherently inclined toward material concerns; salvation requires alien grace from outside created order's causative chains.

Internal variations concerned creation's status—Marcion viewed it as morally neutral but inferior; some followers considered it actively evil. Debates emerged on whether demiurge was evil or merely just but not good, and whether matter itself was caused or eternal.

Orthodox Christian critics, especially Tertullian in Against Marcion (208 CE), argued this contradicted monotheism and biblical continuity. Irenaeus contended good creation proves God's unified causative power. The theological response significantly shaped orthodox formulations of creation and redemption as unified divine causation.

Contemporary scholarship by Sebastian Moll and Judith Lieu examines Marcionism as radical interpretation of Paul's law/grace tension. The causation framework parallels Gnostic dualism while lacking complex emanation mythology, anticipates some Protestant emphases on grace versus works, and resonates with process theology's distinction between creative and redemptive divine action, while maintaining absolute separation between creative and redemptive causative principles.

*** 1.4.71 Catharism Response

Catharism articulates a radical dualistic causation derived from Bogomil influences, teaching that two eternal principles cause reality: the good God creating spiritual realm and souls, while Satan (or corrupted secondary divine principle) causes material world as prison for angelic souls who fell through seduction or rebellion. Material causation operates through evil power; spiritual causation flows from good God accessible through ascetic purification and consolamentum sacrament.

The tradition flourished in Languedoc region of southern France from the mid-12th century until crusader suppression by 1255, with variations in Italy through 14th century. The Cathar Church organized into bishoprics, distinguishing perfecti (those receiving consolamentum and living ascetically) from credentes (ordinary believers). Theological formulations appear in Inquisition records, particularly testimony recorded by inquisitors like Bernard Gui (1261-1331), and in texts like The Book of Two Principles (mid-13th century), which systematically argued for dual ultimate causation. Nicetas of Constantinople brought Bogomil absolute dualism to Western Cathars at Council of Saint-Félix (1167), shifting some communities from moderate to radical dualism.

Cathar causation interprets John 1:3 ("without him was not anything made") as referring only to spiritual creation; John 18:36 ("My kingdom is not of this world") indicates Jesus originates from different causative principle than material world. Genesis 1 is either allegory or describes Satan's imitation of true divine creation. Matthew 7:18 ("a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit") proves material world's corruption requires evil causative origin. John 8:44 explicitly identifies Satan as alternative causative principle and father of lies.

Core arguments include: (1) Moral and physical evil's persistence proves material world is caused by evil or inferior power; omnipotent good God could not create realm of suffering; (2) Body-soul conflict evidences dual causative origin—soul from good God, body from Satan; (3) Procreation perpetuates Satan's causative power by imprisoning more souls in matter; celibacy breaks cycle of material causation; (4) Consolamentum sacrament causes spiritual rebirth by reconnecting soul with good God's causation, breaking Satan's causative control.

Significant internal division existed between absolute dualists (Satan as eternal evil principle) and modified dualists (Satan as fallen angel who causes materially but depends on God's initial causation). Italian Cathars debated whether evil principle could truly create or only fashion from pre-existing chaos.

Catholic critics condemned dualism as Manichaean heresy. Inquisitors argued material creation's beauty and order proves good causation; Christ's incarnation demonstrates matter's capacity for redemption rather than inherent evil.

Contemporary scholarship by Malcolm Barber and R.I. Moore examines Catharism's social contexts and theological development. The causation framework parallels Gnostic and Manichaean dualism, Platonic body-soul tension, and anticipates some Protestant skepticism toward material sacraments, while distinctively combining absolute dualism with Christian Gospel focus and creating comprehensive alternative causation theology within medieval European Christianity.

*** 1.4.72 Bogomilism Response

Bogomilism presents a modified dualistic causation originating in 10th century Bulgaria, teaching that God has two sons—Christ and Satanael—with the latter causing material creation through rebellion and deception, trapping angelic souls in physical bodies, while Christ causes spiritual salvation through revealed knowledge and return to divine realm. Material causation results from diabolic activity; spiritual causation flows from the heavenly Father through Christ.

Founded by Bulgarian priest Bogomil (Theophilus, meaning "beloved of God") around 950 CE during reign of Tsar Peter I (927-969), amid social upheaval and perceived church corruption. The movement spread throughout Byzantine Empire and into Western Europe, influencing Catharism. Cosmas the Priest's Sermon Against the Bogomils (c. 970) provides earliest hostile account of their causation theology. The Interrogatio Johannis (Secret Supper), preserved in Latin translation (13th century), presents Bogomil myth where Satanael causes material world by claiming creative power and trapping angels in bodily prisons. Euthymius Zigabenus' account in Panoplia Dogmatica (c. 1100) describes Bogomil causation hierarchy where God permits Satanael's causative activity temporarily before final restoration.

Bogomil causation radically reinterprets biblical narrative: Satanael, God's first-created angel, causes material cosmos through imitation-creation (Genesis 1), makes bodies to imprison angels (Genesis 2), and rules as "god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4). John 1:3 applies only to spiritual creation; John 12:31 ("prince of this world will be cast out") confirms Satan's causative reign is temporary. Luke 10:18 ("I saw Satan fall like lightning") describes original rebellion that caused diabolic creative activity. Prayer to "Our Father who art in heaven" emphasizes God's distance from earthly material causation.

Four key causation arguments include: (1) Hierarchical institutional church with material wealth results from Satanael's causation; true spiritual causation operates through simple prayer and itinerant preaching; sacramental materialism perpetuates diabolic causation; (2) Old Testament primarily records Satanael's causative activity and laws; New Testament reveals Christ's counter-causation of spiritual liberation; (3) Procreation continues Satanael's causative power by creating more body-prisons; celibacy among perfecti disrupts material causation's perpetuation; (4) Christ descended without true material body (docetism) because accepting causation from Satanael would compromise his divine nature.

Internal variations ranged from absolute dualism (Satanael as eternal principle) to modified dualism (Satanael as fallen being whose causative power derives secondarily from God's permission). Debates concerned whether Satanael retains suffix "-el" (of God) after fall, indicating continuing derivative causation.

Orthodox Christian critics, particularly Byzantine theologians like Euthymius of Acmonia, argued this contradicted creatio ex nihilo and made evil equal to good. The implied Christological docetism denied incarnation's salvific causation.

Contemporary scholars including Dmitri Obolensky trace Bogomil causation's blend of Paulician dualism and Slavic religious context. The framework influenced Western Catharism, parallels earlier Manichaean and Gnostic dualistic causation, and represents Eastern Christian engagement with problem of evil through radical causation dualism while maintaining Christ's redemptive causative power.

*** 1.4.73 Paulicianism Response

Paulicianism articulates an adoptionist-dualistic causation emerging from 7th century Armenia, teaching that the spiritual God causes invisible heavenly realm and souls through Christ as adopted Son, while an evil demiurge or Satan causes material world and flesh, binding souls in matter. Material causation operates through malevolent power; spiritual causation flows from transcendent God through Gospel revelation, requiring rejection of material sacraments and veneration.

Founded by Constantine of Mananalis (c. 657-684 CE) near Samosata, who after receiving Gospel from travelling deacon reorganized Christian practice around pure Pauline theology (hence the name) rejecting material mediation of divine causation. Sergius-Tychicus (8th century) systematically developed Paulician dualistic causation theology, leading communities that spread through Armenia and Byzantine Asia Minor. Carbeas (9th century) established Paulician military-religious state at Tephrike (843-878), demonstrating political implications of causation theology that rejected Byzantine Christian material sacramental causation. Peter of Sicily's History of the Heresy of the Manichaeans (c. 870) provides critical but detailed account of Paulician causation beliefs, though conflating them somewhat with Manichaeans.

Paulician causation interprets John 18:36 ("My kingdom is not of this world") as indicating spiritual God did not cause material realm. 2 Corinthians 4:4 ("god of this world has blinded minds of unbelievers") identifies separate causative principle governing material existence. John 8:44 ("you are of your father the devil") indicates dual genealogy from separate causative sources—spiritual from heavenly Father, material from diabolic power. They rejected Old Testament as describing inferior creator's causation, accepting only Luke's Gospel and Pauline epistles as revealing true spiritual causation.

Core arguments include: (1) Material mediation contradicts spiritual causation—sacraments using physical elements (water, bread, wine) perpetuate material causation rather than spiritual; true baptism is spiritual knowledge, not water ritual; (2) Icon and cross veneration worships material creation rather than spiritual God; physical crucifixion represents Satan's causative power over matter, while Christ's spiritual reality remained untouched; (3) Church hierarchy and buildings result from material causative principle; true church consists of spiritual believers without physical structures or ordained mediation; (4) Mary gave birth only to Christ's material body caused by material principle; his divine spiritual nature descended from heaven without material causation.

Internal variations concerned degree of dualism—some Paulicians emphasized ethical dualism (spiritual vs. material practice) while others held ontological dualism (two ultimate causative principles). Debates emerged regarding Christ's nature and whether material world was created fallen or became corrupted.

Byzantine Orthodox critics condemned Paulicianism as Manichaean dualism destroying sacramental theology. Photius emphasized unified divine causation creating good material world. Physical persecution culminated under Empress Theodora (842-867), though communities survived and influenced Bogomils.

Contemporary scholarship by Nina Garsoïan examines Paulician Armenian context and theological development. The causation framework parallels Marcionite rejection of Old Testament creator, anticipates Protestant iconoclasm and rejection of sacramental materialism, and influenced later dualistic movements while distinctively combining adoptionist Christology with causation dualism and radical rejection of material religious mediation.

*** 1.4.74 Manicheism Response

Manicheism articulates the most systematic and absolute dualistic causation of Late Antiquity, teaching two eternal uncreated principles—Light and Darkness—whose conflict causes cosmic history, with material world resulting from mixture after Darkness's invasion of Light realm, requiring elaborate redemptive causation to separate light particles from matter and restore original separation. Causation operates through three time-phases: past separation, present mixture, and future restoration.

Founded by Mani (216-274 CE) in Sassanian Mesopotamia, who synthesized Zoroastrian dualism, Buddhist cosmology, and Christian soteriology into systematic religion presenting himself as "Seal of the Prophets" completing Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus's revelations. Mani composed original scriptures including Living Gospel, Treasure of Life, and Book of Giants (fragments preserved in various languages), using visual art (lost Arzhang) to illustrate causation cosmology. Augustine of Hippo's (354-430) Confessions and anti-Manichaean works provide detailed critical account after his nine years as Manichaean "Hearer." Coptic Manichaean texts from Egypt, particularly Kephalaia (discovered 1930), preserve detailed causation theology: Father of Greatness causes emanation of Primal Man to combat Darkness; when defeated, his light-armor (souls) becomes mixed with matter, necessitating elaborate rescue causation through successive messengers.

Manichaean causation interprets John 1:5 ("light shines in darkness, and darkness did not overcome it") as describing eternal cosmic conflict between causative principles. John 8:44 ("devil was murderer from beginning") indicates independent evil causative principle coeternal with good. 1 John 5:19 ("whole world lies in the evil one") describes material causation's diabolic origin. 2 Corinthians 4:4 confirms Satan causes this world-age.

Five core causation arguments structure Manichaean theology: (1) Absolute dualism solves theodicy—evil doesn't result from good God's causation but from independent evil principle; God is entirely good but not omnipotent regarding evil's causation; (2) Mixed causation explains human nature—reason and spirit derive from Light's causation, appetites and flesh from Darkness's causation; internal conflict evidences dual causative origin; (3) Cosmogonic causation describes world's creation through violence and mixture rather than intentional divine creative act; material existence itself results from tragic necessity, not divine plan; (4) Soteriological causation operates through knowledge and asceticism—recognizing true causative dualism and liberating light particles through vegetarianism, celibacy, and spiritual practice causes cosmic redemption; (5) Eschatological causation culminates in complete separation—Jesus the Splendor causes final judgment extracting all remaining light, after which material cosmos caused by Darkness burns eternally.

Internal variations distinguished Elect (pure practitioners causing maximum liberation of light) and Hearers (supporters whose lesser practice still contributed to redemptive causation). Regional variations developed in Roman Mediterranean, Central Asia, and China, adapting causation terminology to local concepts.

Critics from Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism attacked absolute dualism as compromising monotheism and divine sovereignty. Augustine's critique emphasized logical problems: if principles are equal in power, eternal stalemate should result; if unequal, dualism dissolves; evil's causative power ultimately derives from good's permission.

Contemporary scholarship by Samuel Lieu and Jason BeDuhn examines Manicheism's sophisticated synthesis and global spread. The causation framework parallels Zoroastrian dualism while radicalizing it, influenced Gnostic and Cathar theology, and represents most philosophically developed ancient dualistic causation system, attempting to solve theodicy through absolute metaphysical dualism of causative principles.

*** 1.4.75 Mandaeism Response

Mandaeism presents a complex dualistic causation theology from Mesopotamian traditions, teaching that the supreme King of Light causes spiritual World of Light and emanates uthras (beings of light) through thought-causation, while the material world is caused by Ptahil, a lesser demiurgic figure who creates imperfectly, trapping souls in physical existence. Liberation causation occurs through manda (knowledge) transmitted by Hibil, Šitil, and Anuš (variants of Abel, Seth, and Enosh), enabling soul's ascent through planetary spheres controlled by hostile causative powers.

The tradition's origins remain debated—possibly pre-Christian (1st century CE or earlier) with Jewish and Iranian influences, developed in Mesopotamia through Parthian and Sassanian periods. The Ginza Rabba (Great Treasure, compiled 3rd-7th centuries CE) provides comprehensive causation cosmology: Life (Hiia) causes Manda d-Hiia (Knowledge of Life) to emanate, who descends to instruct trapped souls. The Book of John the Baptizer (7th-8th centuries) presents John as primary prophet revealing causation truth, opposing Jesus whom Mandaeans identify with false planetary powers. Harran Gawaita (medieval chronicle) records migration traditions and causation mythology. Contemporary Mandaean priests (shamans and tarmidas) transmit causation teachings through ritual, particularly baptism (masbuta) causing purification that counteracts material world's contaminating causation.

Mandaean causation interprets Genesis through dualistic lens: Ptahil creates material Adam (prototype of earthly bodies) but requires Higher Powers to cause spiritual animation; Eve (Hawwa) receives hidden gnosis from Hibil enabling recognition of true causative hierarchy beyond Ptahil's realm. Planetary spheres (especially Sun and Moon) cause astrological determination over earthly life, requiring ritual counteraction. Rivers, especially Euphrates and Tigris, contain living waters through which Life's causation flows, making frequent baptism necessary to restore connection with light-causation.

Core causation arguments include: (1) Graduated causation hierarchy—King of Light causes through successive emanations of uthras; Ptahil creates materially but lacks full causative power, producing flawed cosmos; planetary archons cause intermediate determination; (2) Knowledge-transmission causation—manda functions as causative agent transmitted from light realm, enabling soul to remember origin and navigate post-mortem ascent through hostile causative spheres; (3) Ritual causation—baptism doesn't merely symbolize but actively causes purification and reconnection with light-world; masiqta (death mass) causes soul's elevation through spheres by priestly mediation; (4) Moral causation operates separately from cosmic creation—ethical living aligns soul with light-world's causation regardless of body's imprisonment in material causation.

Internal variations concern Ptahil's precise status—some traditions emphasize his ignorance, others his malevolence; debates exist regarding whether material creation is fallen-but-correctable or inherently evil. Contemporary Mandaeans (approximately 60,000-100,000 worldwide, primarily in Iraq, Iran, and diaspora) maintain diverse interpretations while preserving ritual practices.

Zoroastrian and later Islamic authorities criticized Mandaean dualism, while Mandaeans distinguished themselves from Manichaean absolute dualism by maintaining material creation within overall divine causation, though executed imperfectly by demiurge.

Contemporary scholarship by Jorunn Buckley and Charles Häberl examines Mandaeism as surviving example of ancient Mesopotamian Gnostic traditions. The causation framework parallels Sethian Gnostic demiurgic causation, Hermetic planetary sphere ascent, and Zoroastrian light-darkness dualism, while distinctively centering on baptismal causation and preserving pre-Christian Semitic religious elements within Gnostic causation framework, representing unique synthesis of Near Eastern dualistic and Jewish wisdom traditions.
