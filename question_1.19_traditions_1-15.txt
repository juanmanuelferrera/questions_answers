*** 1.19.1 Catholic (Roman Catholic - Thomistic) Response

Catholic theology, particularly in its Thomistic formulation, maintains that space and time do not exist independently of matter but rather constitute relational orders dependent upon creation itself. This position emerges from Aquinas's synthesis of Aristotelian metaphysics with Christian doctrine, wherein time is defined as "the measure of motion according to before and after" (*Summa Theologiae* I, Q.10, A.1), intrinsically linking temporal succession to material change. Space, understood through the Aristotelian category of *ubi* (place), represents the relationship between bodies rather than an independent container. The Thomistic framework distinguishes God's eternity (*aeternitas*) from temporal succession (*tempus*), establishing that while creatures exist within spatiotemporal coordinates, these coordinates themselves depend upon the existence of material creation.

The development of this doctrine traces from Augustine's revolutionary insight in *Confessions* XI that time itself was created with the universe, through Aquinas's refinement using Aristotelian categories, to twentieth-century Neo-Thomist engagement with relativity theory. Étienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain demonstrated how Thomistic metaphysics anticipated Einstein's relational understanding of spacetime, though maintaining the crucial distinction between mathematical descriptions and ontological reality. Contemporary Thomists like Edward Feser argue that modern physics confirms rather than contradicts the Aristotelian-Thomistic position that space and time are *accidents* inhering in substance rather than independent *substantiae*.

Scripture supports this relational view: Genesis 1:1 indicates a definite beginning of creation, while 2 Peter 3:8 suggests time's relativity to divine perception. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) affirmed creation *ex nihilo*, implying that all creaturely attributes, including spatiotemporal extension, derive from God's creative act. Against Newtonian absolute space, Thomism emphasizes that God's omnipresence (*omnipraesentia*) is not spatial but causal—God exists where He operates, which is everywhere, but not *in* space as creatures are.

Internal variations exist: some Neo-Scholastics adopted quasi-Newtonian positions before relativity theory, while process-influenced Catholic thinkers like Teilhard de Chardin emphasized temporal becoming more dynamically. Protestant critics charge that Catholic sacramental theology requires quasi-substantial space, while Eastern Orthodox thinkers prefer energetic over causal language. Contemporary applications address cosmology and quantum mechanics: if vacuum fluctuations constitute "matter," does empty space truly exist? Thomistic distinctions between *materia prima* (prime matter) and *materia signata* (individuated matter) provide sophisticated tools for analyzing whether quantum fields represent genuine substantiality. The tradition's emphasis on relational rather than absolute space harmonizes remarkably with general relativity while maintaining metaphysical realism against purely mathematical interpretations.

*** 1.19.2 Protestant (Reformed/Lutheran) Response

Protestant theology, particularly in Reformed and Lutheran expressions, generally affirms that space and time do not possess independent existence but function as created frameworks ordering God's creative work. This position emerges from the fundamental Protestant principle of *sola Scriptura* applied to cosmological questions, emphasizing that Genesis 1:1 establishes temporal beginning and that Colossians 1:16-17 declares all things created "in him" and held together by Christ's sustaining power. Space and time thus represent creaturely conditions rather than eternal metaphysical necessities. Luther's doctrine of divine omnipresence (*praesentia Dei*) and the Reformed emphasis on God's transcendence both resist according independent reality to spatiotemporal categories that would limit divine sovereignty.

The Reformation heritage on this question shows significant development. Luther, in his Genesis commentary, explicitly rejected Aristotelian notions of eternal matter, insisting that time began with creation. Calvin's *Institutes* (I.14.1) emphasized that "before" creation is meaningless, anticipating later philosophical insights. The Lutheran Formula of Concord's treatment of Christ's bodily presence (the *ubiquity* debates) engaged spatial categories intensely: against Zwinglian localization, Lutherans argued that Christ's human nature participates in divine omnipresence, suggesting that creaturely spatial limitation is contingent rather than necessary. Reformed theologians, more cautious about communicating divine attributes to Christ's humanity, nevertheless maintained that spatial extension is creational rather than primordial.

Seventeenth-century Protestant scholastics engaged Cartesian and Newtonian theories vigorously. Reformed thinker Gisbertus Voetius distinguished God's *immensitas* (boundlessness) from creaturely extension, while Lutheran metaphysician Johann Andreas Quenstedt defended space as relational. Jonathan Edwards, in his *Notes on Natural Science*, proposed that space consists in God's immediate presence to creation, offering a proto-phenomenological account. Contemporary Protestant thought engages physics through figures like John Polkinghorne (Anglican) and Alister McGrath (Reformed), who interpret relativity theory as confirming creation's contingency against eternal universe models.

Biblical warrants include Psalm 90:2 ("Before the mountains were brought forth... from everlasting to everlasting you are God"), Hebrews 11:3 ("the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible"), and Acts 17:28 ("in him we live and move and have our being"). These texts suggest spatiotemporal existence depends on divine creative and sustaining activity.

Internal diversity appears in fundamentalist tendencies toward Newtonian absolutes versus sophisticated Reformed engagement with relativity. Catholic critics note Protestant difficulty maintaining sacramental realism without substantial spatial categories, while process theologians challenge the tradition's strong creation-Creator distinction. Contemporary applications address young-earth creationism's time-scale debates and cosmological fine-tuning arguments, where Protestant thinkers increasingly recognize that divine transcendence permits varied physical cosmologies within theological orthodoxy.

*** 1.19.3 Orthodox (Eastern Orthodox) Response

Eastern Orthodox theology approaches the question of space and time's independent existence through its distinctive understanding of divine energies (*energeiai*), creation, and the transfiguration of material reality. The Orthodox position holds that space and time do not exist independently of matter but rather constitute created conditions that, while real, participate in God's uncreated energies and are destined for eschatological transformation. This framework emerges from the Cappadocian synthesis of Christian doctrine with modified Platonic metaphysics, wherein Gregory of Nyssa's *On the Making of Man* establishes that material creation, including its spatiotemporal dimensions, originates in God's will rather than necessity. Space and time belong to the *ktisis* (creation), fundamentally distinguished from God's eternal, simple essence (*ousia*) yet pervaded by His uncreated energies through which He is genuinely present to creation.

The patristic development of this teaching shows remarkable sophistication. Maximus the Confessor's *Ambigua* articulated how the *logoi* (divine principles) of created things exist eternally in God while their material instantiation occurs temporally. John of Damascus, in *Exposition of the Orthodox Faith* (I.13), described God as neither in place nor in time but as "Himself creating both place and time," establishing clear ontological dependence. The fourteenth-century Hesychast controversy crystallized Orthodox distinctions: Gregory Palamas's essence-energies distinction preserved divine transcendence while affirming real divine presence in creation, implying that space itself can be transfigured (as on Mount Tabor) without compromising creaturely integrity.

This theological vision finds scriptural foundation in texts emphasizing creation's contingency (Isaiah 40:22, "He who sits above the circle of the earth") and eschatological renewal (Revelation 21:1, "new heaven and new earth"). The liturgical cry "Time no longer!" (*chronos ouketi estai*) from Revelation 10:6, frequently invoked in Orthodox eschatology, suggests time's provisional character. Orthodox cosmology emphasizes *kairotic* time (qualitative, salvific moments) over mere *chronos* (quantitative succession), indicating that temporal experience is transformable through participation in divine life.

Contemporary Orthodox theologians like John Zizioulas emphasize that personhood transcends while engaging spatiotemporal limitation, and that ecclesial existence anticipates creation's eschatological liberation from corruption. Georges Florovsky engaged modern physics, arguing that relativity's unification of spacetime resonates with Orthodox holistic metaphysics. Against Western Scholastic approaches (both Catholic and Protestant) that Orthodox thinkers perceive as overly rationalistic, the tradition emphasizes apophatic reserve: we know space and time are created conditions but cannot exhaustively systematize their relationship to divine eternity. This position navigates between Newtonian absolutism and reductive relationism, maintaining that spatiotemporal frameworks possess genuine creaturely reality while remaining radically dependent on divine creative will and destined for transfiguration in the age to come.

*** 1.19.4 Oriental Orthodox (Coptic/Armenian/Syrian/Ethiopian) Response

Oriental Orthodox Christianity—encompassing Coptic, Armenian, Syrian Orthodox, and Ethiopian traditions—maintains that space and time exist as created realities fundamentally dependent upon matter and God's creative action, lacking independent ontological status. This position flows from the traditions' Cyrillian Christological emphasis on the unity of divine and creaturely existence in the Incarnation, which provides the theological lens through which all cosmological questions are addressed. If space and time possessed autonomous existence independent of creation, the hypostatic union's integrity would be compromised, as Christ's assumption of humanity would not fully encompass all creaturely conditions. The Oriental Orthodox framework, developed through thinkers like Severus of Antioch and Timothy Aelurus, emphasizes that spatiotemporal extension constitutes a property (*idioma*) of created nature rather than a pre-existent container into which creation is placed.

The patristic heritage informing this position centers on Cyril of Alexandria's anti-Nestorian polemic, which established that attributes of created existence, including spatial localization and temporal succession, are assumed and transformed in Christ without division or confusion (*synkrasis*). The *Mystagogia* attributed to Cyril explores how sacramental presence transcends spatial limitation while remaining truly material, suggesting that space itself is a created condition permitting divine-human encounter rather than an obstacle to it. Philoxenus of Mabbug, a sixth-century Syrian theologian, articulated how time's directionality toward eschatological fulfillment indicates its purposive, created character rather than eternal necessity.

Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, preserved in the *Kebra Nagast* and commentarial literature, emphasizes creation's goodness and purposiveness, viewing spatiotemporal order as divinely willed structure rather than metaphysical given. Armenian theological development, particularly through Gregory of Narek's *Book of Lamentations*, presents temporal existence as the arena of repentance and divine encounter, its linear character reflecting God's pedagogical design. Coptic liturgical theology, expressed in the Anaphora of Saint Basil, proclaims God as "existing before all ages" and "creating time," explicitly subordinating temporal succession to divine creative will.

Scriptural foundations include Genesis 1:1's temporal beginning, Wisdom 11:20 ("you arranged all things by measure and number and weight"), and John 1:3 ("all things were made through him"). These texts collectively indicate spatiotemporal order's derivative character. Contemporary Oriental Orthodox engagement with cosmology remains limited compared to other traditions, though scholars like Metropolitan Bishoy of Damietta have addressed concordism between patristic cosmology and modern physics.

Internal variations reflect linguistic and cultural differences: Ethiopian traditions incorporate indigenous African time-consciousness into Christian frameworks, while Armenian theology shows Hellenistic philosophical influence. Against Chalcedonian traditions, Oriental Orthodox thinkers emphasize that spatial and temporal categories must be understood primarily through Christological rather than abstract metaphysical analysis. Modern applications address diaspora experience—how sacred space and liturgical time maintain identity across geographical displacement—and ecological theology, where spatiotemporal ordering reflects divine care for material creation's flourishing.

*** 1.19.5 Evangelical/Pentecostal Response

Evangelical and Pentecostal Christianity affirms that space and time are created realities dependent upon God's sovereign action, existing instrumentally to facilitate divine purposes rather than possessing independent ontological status. This position emerges from the movements' characteristic emphasis on biblical authority, supernatural intervention, and God's dynamic engagement with creation. If space and time existed independently of God's creative will, they would constitute limitations on divine sovereignty—an unacceptable constraint for traditions emphasizing God's absolute freedom and miraculous intervention in natural processes. The Evangelical principle of *sola Scriptura* demands that cosmological understanding conform to biblical revelation, which consistently presents temporal beginning (Genesis 1:1) and God's transcendence over spatial limitation (1 Kings 8:27: "the highest heaven cannot contain you").

Historical development shows interesting trajectories. Early fundamentalist cosmology, exemplified in the Scofield Reference Bible's dispensationalist framework, emphasized temporal divisions as divinely ordered epochs, suggesting time's theological rather than autonomous character. Mid-twentieth-century Evangelical scholars like Carl F.H. Henry engaged modern physics, arguing in *God, Revelation and Authority* that biblical theism anticipates relativity's rejection of Newtonian absolute space. Pentecostal theology, with its emphasis on *kairos* moments of divine breakthrough, inherently challenges sequential, mechanical time, seeing temporal order as permeable to supernatural interruption. Contemporary figures like William Lane Craig (Evangelical philosopher) have developed sophisticated arguments that spacetime's beginning at the Big Bang confirms biblical creation doctrine and necessitates a transcendent Creator existing independently of spatiotemporal manifolds.

Pentecostal distinctive contributions emphasize experiential dimensions: speaking in tongues represents language transcending normal spatiotemporal communication structures; healing and miracles demonstrate divine sovereignty over natural laws governing spatial extension and temporal succession. Classical Pentecostal theologians like Myer Pearlman taught that God operates "outside time," enabling prophecy and providential orchestration. Charismatic renewal emphasized God's immediate presence, challenging deistic conceptions requiring spatial mediation.

Biblical foundations are extensive: Psalm 90:4 ("a thousand years in your sight are like a day"), 2 Peter 3:8 (similar temporal relativity), Isaiah 57:15 ("the high and lofty one who inhabits eternity"), and Revelation 1:8 (God as Alpha and Omega, encompassing temporal beginning and end). These texts establish divine transcendence over created spatiotemporal orders.

Internal diversity appears in young-earth creationism's literalist chronologies versus old-earth Evangelical positions accepting cosmological timescales. Word of Faith movements emphasize believers' authority over natural conditions, including spatial-temporal limitations, through faith declarations—a position mainstream Evangelicals critique as overrealized eschatology. Against liberal Protestant accommodation to naturalistic cosmologies, Evangelicals maintain supernatural intervention's reality; against Catholic sacramental substantialism, they emphasize spiritual over spatial presence. Contemporary applications include apologetics engaging fine-tuning arguments, prosperity gospel spatial claims about territorial spirits, and missions theology addressing gospel proclamation across cultural time-consciousness differences, where understanding varies between Western linear and non-Western cyclical temporal frameworks.

*** 1.19.6 Restorationist/Adventist Response

Restorationist and Adventist movements, including traditions like Seventh-day Adventism, the Churches of Christ, and the Latter-day Saints, approach the question of space and time's independent existence through distinctive hermeneutical commitments to biblical primitivism and, in some cases, materialistic metaphysics that challenge mainstream Christian philosophy. The dominant position within conservative Restorationism affirms that space and time are created frameworks without independent existence, serving God's redemptive purposes. However, Latter-day Saint theology presents a notable exception, teaching that matter is eternal and uncreated, which implies spatiotemporal extension may possess a form of independent reality, though always subject to divine organization rather than creation *ex nihilo*.

Seventh-day Adventist theology, shaped by Ellen G. White's cosmological visions and biblical literalism, maintains robust creation *ex nihilo* doctrine emphasizing that Genesis 1:1 establishes absolute temporal beginning. The Adventist emphasis on the seventh-day Sabbath as memorial of creation week grounds theological anthropology in specific temporal ordering—six literal days of creation followed by divine rest, establishing time's theological purposiveness. Space similarly serves divine intentions: the heavenly sanctuary doctrine, central to Adventist soteriology, posits real spatial dimensions to Christ's high-priestly ministry, though transcending earthly physics. Contemporary Adventist scholars like Richard Davidson defend young-earth chronology, viewing geological timescales as compromising biblical authority, thus making temporal frameworks definitively dependent on revealed divine action.

Churches of Christ and Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), following Alexander Campbell's rational biblicism, generally adopt commonsense realism regarding space and time as created orders, avoiding speculative metaphysics. Campbell's *Christian System* emphasized that biblical revelation provides sufficient cosmological understanding: God existed "before" creation, time began with creation, and eschatological consummation will introduce transformed spatiotemporal conditions. This pragmatic approach resists both philosophical abstraction and scientific concordism.

Latter-day Saint metaphysics diverges dramatically through distinctive scripture. *Doctrine and Covenants* 93:29 declares "there is no such thing as immaterial matter" and "the elements are eternal," suggesting space (as extension of matter) and time (as measure of material motion) possess primordial reality. Joseph Smith's *King Follett Discourse* taught that God organized pre-existent matter rather than creating *ex nihilo*, implying spatiotemporal frameworks preceded divine organizational activity. This materialistic metaphysics, influenced by nineteenth-century American philosophy, positions LDS thought closer to process theology than classical theism.

Biblical interpretation varies accordingly: mainstream Restorationists emphasize Genesis 1:1, Hebrews 11:3, and John 1:3 as establishing creation from nothing, including spatiotemporal dimensions. LDS interpreters read Genesis 1:1 as "organized" rather than absolutely created. All traditions affirm divine sovereignty over natural processes and reject deistic mechanistic determinism. Contemporary applications include Adventist engagement with relativity theory (some scholars like Leonard Brand integrate scientific cosmology with biblical chronology through mature creation theories), and LDS dialogue with physics regarding eternal matter and energy conservation laws. These diverse positions reflect Restorationism's commitment to biblical authority while demonstrating how hermeneutical approaches and philosophical assumptions generate significantly different cosmological conclusions.

*** 1.19.7 Eastern Christian (Chaldean/Assyrian) Response

The Eastern Christian traditions, particularly the Church of the East (Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East) and related Chaldean Catholic communities, maintain that space and time are created realities fundamentally dependent upon matter and divine creative will, possessing no independent ontological existence. This position emerges from the tradition's distinctive Antiochene theological heritage, emphasizing the historical and material dimensions of salvation history while maintaining robust divine transcendence. The Syriac theological framework, developed through luminaries like Ephrem the Syrian, Narsai, and Babai the Great, presents a cosmology wherein spatiotemporal order reflects divine *rāzā* (mystery) made manifest in creation's rational structure, which points toward the Creator while remaining utterly dependent upon His sustaining presence (*qnomā*).

The Antiochene school's characteristic attention to historical particularity and literal biblical interpretation shaped this tradition's cosmological understanding. Theodore of Mopsuestia, whose exegetical works profoundly influenced East Syrian theology, emphasized creation's temporal beginning and purposive ordering toward eschatological consummation. His commentary on Genesis established that "in the beginning" (*brēšīṯ*/*beresheet*) denotes absolute commencement rather than eternal matter's organization, directly opposing Greek philosophical notions of eternal materiality. Ephrem the Syrian's poetic theology, preserved in the *Hymns on Paradise* and *Commentary on Genesis*, presents creation as temporal narrative revealing divine pedagogy, with time itself constituting a merciful provision allowing human progression toward sanctification.

Narsai's *Homilies*, central to East Syrian liturgical tradition, elaborate how creation's spatiotemporal structure participates in sacramental reality: the Eucharistic elements, occupying space and consecrated within temporal liturgy, become vehicles of divine presence without space or time thereby achieving independent metaphysical status. Babai the Great's *Book of Union*, defending dyophysite Christology, carefully distinguishes the two natures' properties—divine nature existing beyond spatiotemporal limitation, human nature existing within created spatiotemporal framework—without separation or confusion. This Christological precision requires understanding spatial and temporal extension as properties (*kyānāyē*) of created nature rather than neutral metaphysical containers.

Scriptural foundations include Genesis 1:1, affirmed in Syriac tradition as establishing temporal beginning, and Colossians 1:17 ("in him all things hold together"), interpreted as indicating creation's continuous dependence on divine sustaining activity. The Liturgy of Addai and Mari, among Christianity's most ancient Eucharistic prayers, invokes God who "made all things, visible and invisible," affirming comprehensive divine creative agency over all creaturely existence, including its spatiotemporal conditions.

Contemporary Eastern Christian thought, particularly within diaspora communities, engages modernity cautiously. Scholars like Mar Bawai Soro have explored consonance between patristic cosmology and relativity theory, noting that East Syrian emphasis on divine will's primacy over philosophical necessity anticipates modern physics' contingency. Against Western Scholastic substance-accident metaphysics, the tradition prefers dynamic relational categories. Internal diversity is limited given these communities' relative theological conservatism, though Chaldean Catholic integration with Latin theology introduces Thomistic elements. Modern applications address liturgical temporality—how sacred time structures diaspora identity—and ecological theology, where Ephrem's creation spirituality informs environmental stewardship emphasizing humanity's temporal responsibility.

*** 1.19.8 Contemporary Christian Movements Response

Contemporary Christian movements, encompassing emergent church networks, progressive Christianity, eco-theology movements, and various post-denominational expressions, demonstrate remarkable diversity regarding space and time's independent existence, generally rejecting classical metaphysical formulations in favor of phenomenological, ecological, or process-oriented approaches. The dominant tendency affirms that space and time are relational, socially constructed, or participatory realities rather than independent substances, but these movements resist systematic metaphysics, preferring experiential and pragmatic orientations. This eclecticism reflects postmodern suspicion of grand narratives and embrace of contextual, pluralistic theological method, where cosmological questions are addressed through praxis-oriented frameworks emphasizing justice, embodiment, and ecological interconnection rather than abstract ontology.

Emergent church thinkers like Brian McLaren and Peter Rollins draw on continental philosophy, particularly phenomenology and poststructuralism, to reconceive spatiotemporal existence. McLaren's *A New Kind of Christianity* presents space and time not as metaphysical givens but as interpretive frameworks shaped by narrative and community. This approach resonates with social constructionism while maintaining that divine creativity underlies all existence. Rob Bell's *Love Wins* employs fluid temporal categories, emphasizing qualitative *kairos* over quantitative *chronos*, suggesting liberation from mechanical time through kingdom participation. These thinkers generally avoid traditional creation *ex nihilo* formulations, preferring open-ended language about divine creativity that leaves metaphysical specifics underdetermined.

Progressive Christianity, represented by figures like John Shelby Spong and Marcus Borg, often adopts panentheistic frameworks influenced by process theology. Here, space-time constitutes God's "body" or the relational matrix within which divine becoming occurs. Process-influenced thinker Catherine Keller, in *The Face of the Deep*, proposes a creatio ex profundis (creation from the deep) reading Genesis 1, suggesting spatiotemporal potentiality precedes divine creative ordering—a position diverging sharply from classical theism. Sallie McFague's ecological theology presents space as the "body of God," rejecting transcendent Creator/creation dualism in favor of immanentist metaphors emphasizing mutual divine-cosmic interdependence.

Eco-theology movements, drawing on deep ecology and indigenous wisdom, often critique Western linear time as ideologically linked to exploitative progressivism. Theologians like Norman Wirzba propose recovered cyclical temporality honoring creation's rhythms—seasonal, agricultural, liturgical—over industrial mechanical time. Similarly, sacred space theology emphasizes particular places' spiritual significance, rejecting homogeneous abstract space for qualitatively differentiated landscapes bearing meaning and divine presence.

Biblical interpretation in these movements typically emphasizes creation care passages (Genesis 2:15, Romans 8:19-22) and incarnational texts (John 1:14, Colossians 1:15-20) supporting material world's theological significance while deemphasizing cosmological origins narratives. Contemporary applications dominate: how do virtual spaces constitute genuine community? How does climate crisis reveal distorted temporal consciousness prioritizing short-term gain? How do marginalized communities experience space differently, requiring spatial justice? These movements' contributions lie less in systematic cosmological doctrine than in recovering embodied, ecological, and justice-oriented engagement with created spatiotemporal existence, challenging both pre-modern substantialism and modern mechanistic reductionism while maintaining, however variously, that divine creativity grounds rather than is constrained by spatiotemporal frameworks.

*** 1.19.9 Christian Mysticism (Western Mystical Tradition) Response

Christian mysticism in its Western expressions, from Pseudo-Dionysius through medieval mystics to contemporary contemplatives, approaches the question of space and time's independent existence through distinctive apophatic and experiential epistemology, maintaining that spatiotemporal categories represent creaturely limitations that contemplative ascent progressively transcends without denying their provisional reality. The mystical tradition affirms that space and time exist dependently upon divine creative will but emphasizes that ultimate reality—experienced in mystical union—surpasses spatiotemporal determination altogether. This position emerges from the Neoplatonic heritage integrated into Christian theology by Pseudo-Dionysius, whose *Mystical Theology* establishes the via negativa: God is neither in place nor in time, and spiritual ascent involves progressive detachment from spatiotemporal modes of knowing toward *theōsis* (divinization) transcending such categories entirely.

Meister Eckhart's German sermons articulate this perspective radically: "God creates the entire world now, in this instant" (*nû*), suggesting that apparent temporal succession is epistemic rather than ontological—creation continuously emerges from divine ground beyond time. Eckhart's concept of the "eternal now" (*nunc aeternitatis*) presents mystical consciousness as participating in God's atemporal creative presence, where past, present, and future collapse into unified simultaneity. This does not negate time's creaturely reality but relativizes it as a perspectival limitation transcended in contemplative experience. Similarly, spatial location dissolves in mystical union: "the eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees me," erasing subject-object spatial separation while maintaining creaturely ontological distinction.

Teresa of Avila's *Interior Castle* presents spiritual journey through spatial metaphor—seven mansions—while simultaneously teaching that the soul's deepest center, where God dwells, transcends physical spatiality entirely. John of the Cross's *Dark Night* describes contemplative purgation as liberation from spatiotemporal attachments, enabling union with eternal God. These Carmelite mystics maintain orthodox creation doctrine while emphasizing experiential transcendence of creaturely conditions including spatiotemporal limitation.

Julian of Norwich's *Revelations of Divine Love* offers distinctive temporal theology: her showings reveal how divine providence encompasses past, present, and future simultaneously, and her famous assurance "all shall be well" rests on seeing temporal process from God's eternal perspective. This contemplative temporality neither denies historical reality nor reduces it to illusion but recognizes its subordination to divine purposes.

Scriptural foundations include 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 (Paul's ineffable third-heaven experience transcending normal spatiotemporal consciousness), Revelation 10:6 ("time shall be no more"), and Psalm 139:7-12 (divine omnipresence transcending spatial limitation). The mystical tradition interprets these texts as indicating contemplative consciousness's capacity to participate proleptically in eschatological reality beyond present spatiotemporal restriction.

Against Scholastic rationalism, mystics emphasize experiential knowledge (*cognitio experimentalis*) over discursive reasoning; against Protestant emphasis on historical revelation, mystics stress unmediated divine encounter. Contemporary mystics like Thomas Merton engaged modern physics, suggesting contemplative consciousness's atemporal quality resonates with relativity's insights. Current applications address mindfulness practices (distinguishing Christian contemplation from Buddhist meditation), virtual reality's challenge to spatial presence, and ecological mysticism's recovery of sacramental place against abstract homogeneous space. The mystical tradition's contribution lies in maintaining space-time's creaturely dependency while testifying to consciousness's capacity, through grace, to transcend these limitations partially in contemplation and completely in beatific vision.

*** 1.19.10 Christian Theological Schools (Patristic/Scholastic/Modern) Response

The Christian theological schools spanning patristic, medieval scholastic, and modern periods demonstrate remarkable continuity in affirming that space and time do not exist independently of matter but constitute created, relational orders dependent upon divine creative and sustaining activity, though the philosophical frameworks articulating this position evolved significantly across epochs. Patristic theology, particularly Augustine's revolutionary treatment in *Confessions* Books XI-XII, established the foundational principle that time itself is created: asking what God was doing "before" creation is incoherent, as temporal succession begins with creation. Augustine's analysis of time as *distentio animi* (stretching of the mind) across memory, attention, and expectation introduced phenomenological dimensions while maintaining time's ontological dependence on created change. Regarding space, the Cappadocians distinguished God's *immensitas* (unboundedness) from creaturely *topos* (place), establishing that spatial relations exist between bodies rather than as independent container.

Medieval Scholasticism refined these insights through Aristotelian categories. Aquinas's *Summa Theologiae* (I, Q.46, A.1-2) demonstrates that reason cannot prove creation's temporal beginning but revelation confirms it, and that time, as "the number of motion according to before and after," depends intrinsically upon material change—no motion, no time. Spatial location (*ubi*) represents one of nine accidents requiring substantial bearer; empty space lacking substantial being is impossible in Aristotelian framework. Duns Scotus introduced haecceity (*haecceitas*) and thisness, emphasizing individual spatiotemporal instantiation as constitutive of creaturely particularity without granting space-time independent reality. Bonaventure's *Itinerarium Mentis in Deum* integrated this metaphysics with mystical theology, presenting spatiotemporal creation as vestige (*vestigium*) of eternal Trinity.

Modern theology engaged revolutionary physics. Protestant liberal theology, exemplified by Schleiermacher's *Christian Faith*, deemphasized cosmological speculation in favor of religious consciousness, treating space-time as phenomenal ordering of experience rather than ontological category. Neo-Thomists like Garrigou-Lagrange defended scholastic positions while engaging relativity theory, arguing that Einstein's work confirmed relationalism over Newtonian absolutism. Karl Barth's *Church Dogmatics* (III/1) presented creation doctrine emphasizing that space and time are good creaturely realities whose existence depends wholly on God's gracious will, not metaphysical necessity. Barth rejected natural theology's pretensions to deduce spatiotemporal nature philosophically apart from Christological revelation.

Twentieth-century developments include process theology (Whitehead, Hartshorne), which posits becoming as fundamental and God as temporal, thereby granting time quasi-independent metaphysical status—a position orthodox theologians largely reject. Karl Rahner's transcendental Thomism explored how human spatiotemporal existence constitutes the condition for receiving divine revelation, while Wolfhart Pannenberg's eschatological ontology presented time's direction toward future consummation as theologically determinative.

Scripture cited across all periods includes Genesis 1:1 (temporal beginning), Colossians 1:17 (continuous dependence), and 2 Peter 3:8 (divine temporal transcendence). Contemporary applications address cosmological fine-tuning, quantum mechanics' challenge to classical causation, and digital culture's transformation of spatial presence and temporal experience. The theological schools' enduring contribution lies in sophisticated metaphysical analysis preventing both deification of space-time (as in some process thought) and reduction to mere mathematical formalism (as in scientific positivism), maintaining creaturely spatiotemporal reality's genuine yet wholly dependent status.

*** 1.19.11 Jewish (Rabbinic Judaism) Response

Rabbinic Judaism approaches the question of space and time's independent existence through distinctive hermeneutical traditions interpreting Torah, Talmudic discussion, and medieval philosophical synthesis, generally affirming that spatiotemporal reality depends fundamentally upon divine creative will (*ratzon*) while exhibiting significant internal diversity between rationalist and mystical schools. The dominant position, rooted in Genesis 1:1's interpretation, maintains that time began with creation (*bereshit bara*—"in beginning, created") and that space, understood through the concept of *makom* (place), serves as one of God's names precisely because God is the "place" of the world while the world is not God's place—indicating spatial categories' derivative character relative to divine reality. This cosmology reflects Judaism's fundamental commitment to creation *ex nihilo* against Greek philosophical eternalism, established definitively by medieval authorities though debated in earlier periods.

Talmudic literature demonstrates sophisticated temporal consciousness without systematic cosmology. Tractate Rosh Hashanah discusses cosmic temporality, while Pirkei Avot's maxim "Who is wise? One who sees the nolad (what is being born/future)" suggests time's purposive rather than mechanical character. The rabbinic concept of *olam* (world/eternity) encompasses both spatial extension and temporal duration, their Hebrew term's double meaning indicating their conceptual interconnection. Sabbath observance, central to Jewish practice, establishes temporal order's theological significance: *Shabbat* sanctifies time, demonstrating that temporal sequence serves divine purposes of rest, remembrance, and sanctification rather than constituting autonomous metaphysical necessity.

Medieval Jewish philosophy crystallized systematic positions. Saadia Gaon's *Emunot ve-Deot* (Book of Beliefs and Opinions) deployed *kalam* arguments demonstrating creation's temporal beginning against Aristotelian eternalism, establishing that time is created rather than primordial. Maimonides' *Guide for the Perplexed* (II:13-31) presents more nuanced position: while defending creation doctrine on theological grounds, Maimonides acknowledged philosophical arguments for eternity's plausibility, ultimately appealing to revelational certainty. His concept of God's absolute incorporeality (*shlilat ha-gashmiut*) entails transcendence of spatial limitation. Later rationalists like Gersonides (Levi ben Gershon) proposed that prime matter exists eternally while formed creation begins temporally—a minority position generally rejected by mainstream tradition.

Kabbalistic mysticism offers radically different framework. The Zohar presents creation emerging through *tzimtzum* (divine contraction), wherein infinite God (*Ein Sof*) withdraws to create conceptual "space" for finite existence. Lurianic Kabbalah developed this into sophisticated cosmogony where *tzimtzum* represents both literal spatial withdrawal and metaphorical divine self-limitation. Here, space possesses theological rather than merely physical significance, as arena of divine presence and absence dynamically interrelated. Hasidic thought, particularly Chabad philosophy, emphasizes *bittul ha-yesh* (nullification of existence), teaching that apparent autonomous existence of spatiotemporal reality is illusory (*acosmism*), with only divine reality truly existing—creation's apparent independence representing epistemic limitation rather than ontological truth.

Contemporary Jewish thought engages modernity variously: Orthodox authorities like Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik integrated traditional metaphysics with modern science, while Conservative and Reform approaches show greater theological pluralism. Applications address Sabbath technology use (does virtual space constitute "domain" for carrying prohibitions?), cosmological concordism in Orthodox apologetics, and Holocaust theology's temporal questions regarding providence and history.

*** 1.19.12 Islamic (Sunni) Response

Sunni Islamic theology (*aqidah*) across its major schools generally affirms that space (*makān*) and time (*zamān*) do not possess independent existence but rather constitute created realities entirely dependent upon Allah's creative and sustaining will (*irādah*), reflecting the fundamental Islamic doctrine of *tawhid* (divine unity and sovereignty). The Qur'anic declaration "He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden" (57:3) and "Every day He is in [a new] matter" (55:29) establish that Allah transcends temporal succession while sustaining creation through continuous creative activity. The Ash'ari school, representing Sunni orthodoxy's dominant theological expression, developed occasionalist metaphysics wherein spatial location and temporal sequence result from Allah's direct creation of accidents (*a'rād*) in atoms (*jawāhir*) at each moment, denying natural causation and secondary causal efficacy—space and time thus possess no autonomous structure but manifest divine will's immediate operation.

Classical Islamic philosophy (*falsafah*) engaged Greek thought more directly than *kalam* (theological dialectic). Al-Kindi, "philosopher of the Arabs," deployed arguments for temporal creation against Aristotelian eternalism, demonstrating that infinite temporal regress is impossible. Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina (Avicenna), more deeply influenced by Neoplatonism, proposed emanationist cosmologies wherein creation flows eternally from divine necessity, making temporal beginning metaphorical rather than literal—positions many Sunni theologians condemned as compromising creation doctrine. Ibn Sina's concept of God as "Necessary Being" (*wājib al-wujūd*) while all else is contingent (*mumkin*) established that spatiotemporal existence possesses no intrinsic necessity, depending wholly on divine creative act. His distinction between essence (*māhiyyah*) and existence (*wujūd*) suggested that spatial extension and temporal duration are existential determinations added to essences rather than belonging to things intrinsically.

The Ash'ari-Maturidi synthesis, systematized by scholars like Al-Ghazali, Al-Baqillani, and Al-Juwayni, rejected philosophical eternalism as contradicting Qur'anic teaching. Al-Ghazali's *Tahāfut al-Falāsifah* (Incoherence of the Philosophers) devastatingly critiqued philosophers' eternal universe doctrine, arguing that divine will can create temporally without implying change in God. His atomistic occasionalism made spatiotemporal continuity depend on Allah's customary (*'ādah*) but not necessary creative pattern—miracles (*mu'jizāt*) demonstrate Allah's sovereign freedom from spatiotemporal constraints.

Qur'anic foundations include "Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and earth in six days" (7:54), establishing temporal framework for creation, and "To Allah belongs the east and the west" (2:115), indicating divine sovereignty over spatial orientation. The concept of *al-lawh al-mahfūz* (the Preserved Tablet) suggests divine knowledge encompasses all temporal events in eternal simultaneity, distinguishing divine *'ilm* (knowledge) from temporal succession characterizing creaturely experience.

Sufi metaphysics introduces distinctive elements: Ibn 'Arabi's *wahdat al-wujūd* (unity of being) presents creation as divine self-disclosure, where spatiotemporal multiplicity manifests single divine reality—apparent independent existence is veiling (*hijāb*) masking underlying unity. This position, controversial among exoteric scholars, influenced Persian and Turkish Sufi traditions.

Contemporary Sunni thought addresses relativity theory: some scholars see Einstein's unification of spacetime as confirming Islamic emphasis on creation's unified dependence on divine will, while others maintain classical atomistic frameworks. Applications include prayer direction (*qibla*) in space travel, Ramadan fasting timing across time zones, and cosmological apologetics.

*** 1.19.13 Roman Catholic (Vatican/Magisterial Emphasis) Response

The Roman Catholic Church's magisterial teaching, articulated through papal encyclicals, conciliar documents, and the Catechism, definitively affirms that space and time do not exist independently of matter but constitute created dimensions of reality wholly dependent upon God's creative *fiat* and sustaining providence. This position represents the authoritative interpretation of Catholic theological tradition, integrating patristic wisdom, Scholastic precision, and engagement with modern science under the Holy Spirit's guidance promised to the Magisterium. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) established foundational dogma: God "by His almighty power at the beginning of time created together out of nothing (*de nihilo*) both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal," indicating that temporal "beginning" itself is created rather than pre-existent, and that all creaturely reality—including its spatiotemporal conditions—originates through divine creative will.

The First Vatican Council (1869-1870) reaffirmed creation doctrine against modern materialisms, teaching in *Dei Filius* that God created "not to increase His own beatitude, nor to acquire, but to manifest His perfection," establishing creation's contingency and purposiveness. This formulation excludes any metaphysical necessity for spatiotemporal frameworks independent of divine creative freedom. Pope Pius XII's 1951 address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences engaged Big Bang cosmology, noting its consonance with Catholic doctrine of temporal beginning while cautioning against overly simplistic concordism—scientific cosmology describes physical processes, while theology addresses ultimate ontological causation. This magisterial prudence established parameters for Catholic engagement with physics: affirm compatibility between faith and reason while respecting disciplinary boundaries.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraphs 279-314) synthesizes magisterial teaching: "Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection... God wills the interdependence of creatures" (340), indicating that spatiotemporal relations among creatures are positively willed aspects of creation's goodness rather than necessary conditions constraining God. The Catechism emphasizes that creation is *ex nihilo*—not from pre-existent matter, not divine emanation, not necessary overflow—but free divine act. This excludes space and time as eternal co-principles with God.

Pope John Paul II's extensive teaching on creation emphasized its Christological dimension: Colossians 1:16-17 reveals that "in him all things were created... all things hold together in him," establishing Christ's cosmic primacy over all creaturely reality including spatiotemporal structures. His 1996 address to the Pontifical Academy acknowledged evolutionary theory's scientific legitimacy while maintaining that material processes cannot account for spiritual soul's creation, distinguishing levels of causation—efficient (natural processes operating within spacetime) from transcendent (divine creative act grounding spatiotemporal existence itself).

Pope Benedict XVI's emphasis on *Logos* theology presented creation as rational order reflecting divine wisdom, suggesting spatiotemporal structures manifest divine intelligence rather than constituting brute metaphysical facts. Pope Francis's *Laudato Si'* extends this to ecological applications: creation care respects spatiotemporal reality as divinely willed gift rather than instrumental resource, temporality enabling human responsibility.

Contemporary magisterial engagement addresses quantum cosmology, multiverse theories, and digital culture's virtual spaces, consistently maintaining that however physics describes spatiotemporal manifolds mathematically, ontologically they remain created realities dependent on transcendent Creator. Applications include bioethics (embryonic human dignity from conception within temporal development), eschatology (resurrection body's transformed spatiotemporal existence), and Catholic social teaching (spatial justice in urban planning, temporal justice in sustainable development).

*** 1.19.14 Eastern Catholic (Byzantine Catholic/Melkite) Response

Eastern Catholic Churches, particularly those of Byzantine tradition including Ukrainian, Melkite, and Ruthenian Catholics, maintain full communion with Rome while preserving distinctive Eastern theological, liturgical, and spiritual heritage that shapes their approach to cosmological questions. Their position on space and time's independent existence reflects synthesis of Eastern patristic theology—especially Cappadocian and Constantinopolitan traditions—with Catholic dogmatic definitions, affirming that spatiotemporal reality constitutes created order radically dependent upon God's creative will while emphasizing liturgical and mystical dimensions often underemphasized in Latin theological discourse. This ecclesial context produces theology attentive to both magisterial authority and Eastern Fathers' apophatic sensibility, resulting in distinctive emphases within Catholic orthodoxy.

The theological foundation draws heavily on Cappadocian cosmology: Gregory of Nazianzus's teaching that God is neither in place nor time but "Himself creates both time and space," and Basil the Great's *Hexaemeron* establishing creation's temporal beginning. Eastern Catholic theology particularly emphasizes theosis—creation's destiny is divinization, transfiguration into participation in divine life. This eschatological orientation affects cosmological understanding: space and time are not merely neutral containers but possess *telic* orientation toward transformation in the parousia. Byzantine liturgical theology, preserved in the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysyostom celebrated by Eastern Catholics, proclaims cosmic glorification where material creation, situated spatiotemporally, participates in eternal divine glory through epiclesis—the Holy Spirit's transformative presence.

The distinction between divine essence (*ousia*) and energies (*energeiai*), though not dogmatically defined for Catholics as in Eastern Orthodoxy, influences Eastern Catholic theological method. God's essence transcends spatiotemporal categories entirely, while divine energies permeate creation without being bounded by it, allowing genuine divine presence in space-time without reducing God to creaturely limitation. This framework, developed by Maximus the Confessor and systematized by Gregory Palamas, provides Eastern Catholics with conceptual tools for addressing divine omnipresence and sacramental presence without compromising transcendence or spatiotemporal reality's genuine creatureliness.

Christological considerations prove central: the hypostatic union establishes that divine Logos assumes complete human nature, including spatiotemporal existence, without confusion or change. Eastern Catholic emphasis on Christ's cosmic headship (Colossians 1:15-20) suggests spatiotemporal order's Christocentric purposiveness—creation exists "for him" as well as "through him." Icon theology, central to Byzantine spirituality, addresses spatial representation's relationship to divine presence: icons occupy physical space yet mediate divine prototype, demonstrating that spatial materiality can become transparent to eternal reality without ceasing to be genuinely spatial.

Liturgical temporality receives particular attention: Byzantine horologion structures daily prayer through sanctifying time, Easter cycle celebration creates sacred temporality distinct from secular chronology, and the troparion for creation hymns God who "brought all things from non-being into being." These liturgical contexts situate cosmological theology within doxological practice rather than abstract speculation.

Contemporary Eastern Catholic thought engages modernity while preserving patristic heritage. Scholars like Archbishop Elias Zoghby and Chorbishop Seely Beggiani have articulated how Eastern Catholic cosmology complements Latin Scholastic approaches, emphasizing participatory ontology over substance metaphysics. Applications address ecumenical dialogue with Eastern Orthodoxy (showing doctrinal compatibility despite papal primacy disagreements), diaspora identity maintenance through sacred spatial-temporal practices, and ecological theology drawing on Basil's and Chrysostom's creation spirituality. The Eastern Catholic contribution within Catholic communion enriches cosmological discourse by integrating apophatic restraint, liturgical temporality, and eschatological transformation while maintaining magisterial teaching on creation's absolute dependence on divine creative freedom.

*** 1.19.15 Traditional Catholic (Traditionalist Movement) Response

The Traditional Catholic movement, encompassing communities attached to the pre-Vatican II liturgy and theological formulations including Society of St. Pius X adherents, sedevacantists, and indult/Ecclesia Dei communities, maintains rigorous adherence to Scholastic metaphysics, particularly Thomistic formulations, regarding space and time's ontological status. This perspective affirms unambiguously that space and time possess no independent existence but constitute accidents of material substance, entirely dependent upon God's creative and conserving causality. Traditional Catholics view this position as definitively established by magisterial teaching, particularly the Fourth Lateran Council's creation *ex nihilo* decree and the First Vatican Council's affirmations, and resist perceived modern theological ambiguities or accommodations to evolutionary or relativistic cosmologies that might compromise these settled doctrines.

The traditionalist commitment to Scholastic precision makes Aquinas's treatment in *Summa Theologiae* and *Summa Contra Gentiles* normative: time is "the measure of motion according to before and after," intrinsically dependent on material change; place (*locus*) is "the immobile boundary of the containing body," requiring substantial being; prime matter (*materia prima*) cannot exist without substantial form, precluding independent space devoid of material instantiation. These Aristotelian-Thomistic principles are understood not as optional philosophical preferences but as rational elaboration of revealed truth consonant with patristic teaching and conciliar definition. Traditional Catholic apologetics emphasizes that this cosmology's philosophical rigor surpasses modern physics' mathematical formalism, which describes phenomena without addressing ultimate ontological causation.

The traditionalist critique of contemporary theology charges that post-conciliar openness to evolutionary cosmology and process-influenced thought has introduced metaphysical confusion. They maintain that Pius XII's 1950 encyclical *Humani Generis*, while permitting cautious investigation of evolutionary hypotheses regarding human bodily origins, definitively required maintaining immediate divine creation of the spiritual soul and special creation of Adam and Eve—positions implying that temporal succession cannot be ultimate explanatory principle. Traditional Catholics often resist Big Bang cosmology's theological appropriation, not necessarily denying its scientific validity but questioning whether temporal singularity truly represents absolute beginning or merely current scientific model subject to revision. Some traditionalist thinkers favor geocentrism or other alternative cosmologies, though this represents minority position.

Scriptural interpretation follows literalist patristic exegesis: Genesis 1:1 establishes temporal beginning, Ecclesiastes 3:11 ("he has put eternity into man's heart") indicates temporal existence points beyond itself toward eternal God, and Wisdom 11:20 ("you have arranged all things by measure and number and weight") suggests mathematical ordering reflects divine wisdom without exhausting ontological reality. The Latin Vulgate's authority is emphasized, with *in principio* (in the beginning) understood as absolute commencement rather than indeterminate starting point.

Liturgical practice reinforces cosmological theology: the Traditional Latin Mass's Prayers at the Foot of the Altar invoke Psalm 43:4 ("I will go to the altar of God, to God who gives joy to my youth"), situating temporal liturgical action within eternal divine life. The Church's calendar structures temporal progression through Christological mysteries, sanctifying time through divinely instituted commemorative order rather than arbitrary human convention.

Contemporary applications include critiques of relativity theory's popularization as undermining objective truth (confusing epistemological observer-dependence with ontological relativism), opposition to virtual reality and transhumanism as denying embodied spatiotemporal human nature's God-given integrity, and defense of Eucharistic realism requiring Christ's substantial presence under spatial accidents of bread and wine. Traditionalists maintain that Scholastic spatial-temporal categories ground sacramental theology more securely than modern phenomenological or personalist approaches, preserving mystery while rejecting irrationalism. This position represents self-conscious ressourcement of premodern Catholic cosmology as permanent achievement rather than historically conditioned formulation requiring revision.
