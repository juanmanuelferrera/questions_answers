The Sannyasi in the Dinosaur Mask (100 words)

A disturbing scenario: a sannyasi in traditional Vaishnava robes wearing funny hats, dinosaur masks, dancing ridiculously, believing chanting alone justifies everything. Shastra's response is unequivocal and severe.

The Bhagavad Gita (6.1) clarifies real renunciation isn't external ritual while doing whatever pleases the mind. Hari-bhakti-vilasa prescribes strict sannyasi conduct: gravity, simplicity, exemplary behavior. A sannyasi serves as society's spiritual guide—circus behavior creates institutional mockery.

Most critically, thinking "I can behave any way because I chant" constitutes offense to the Holy Name itself—namno balad yasya hi papa-buddhih—sinning on chanting's strength. The Holy Name is supreme, but doesn't nullify varnashrama duties or sannyasa vows.

Two choices exist: reform immediately or renounce the dress.
