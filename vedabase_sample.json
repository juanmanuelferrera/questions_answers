      "purport": "Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the widely read theistic science summarized in the G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya (Glorification of the G\u012bt\u0101). There it says that one should read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.\n\nThe word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons\u2019 ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did my sons and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du do?\u201d He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship-even for the denizens of heaven-Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra even while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.\n\nBoth the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\u1e63etra where the father of religion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\u1e63etre and kuru-k\u1e63etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance."

      "purport": "Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Sa\u00f1jaya could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. He wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent King, and thus he warned him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place. Sa\u00f1jaya therefore informed the King that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, at once went to the commander-in-chief, Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, to inform him of the real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana\u2019s diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas."

      "purport": "Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, the great br\u0101hma\u1e47a commander-in-chief. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupad\u012b, who was Arjuna\u2019s wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya knew this perfectly well, and yet, as a liberal br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna took the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were also Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat."

They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as formidable as Bh\u012bma and Arjuna. He knew the strength of Bh\u012bma and Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them."

      "synonyms": "apary\u0101ptam-immeasurable; tat-that; asm\u0101kam-of ours; balam-strength; bh\u012b\u1e63ma-by Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma; abhirak\u1e63itam-perfectly protected; pary\u0101ptam-limited; tu-but; idam-all these; ete\u1e63\u0101m-of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; balam-strength; bh\u012bma-by Bh\u012bma; abhirak\u1e63itam-carefully protected.",
      "translation": "Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, whereas the strength of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, carefully protected by Bh\u012bma, is limited.",
      "purport": "Herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by Duryodhana. He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. On the other hand, the forces of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bh\u012bma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. Duryodhana was always envious of Bh\u012bma because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bh\u012bma. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained."
