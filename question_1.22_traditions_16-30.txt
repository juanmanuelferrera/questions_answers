*** 1.22.16 Franciscan Response

Franciscan theology articulates freedom through *voluntarism*—the primacy of will over intellect—wherein God's absolute freedom establishes creation's contingency and human liberty as reflection of divine self-determination. Emerging from Francis of Assisi's (1181-1226) radical obedience to God's call, the tradition developed sophisticated philosophical defenses of libertarian freedom through John Duns Scotus (1266-1308) and William of Ockham (1287-1347), countering Dominican-Thomistic intellectualism that subordinated will to reason's necessity.

Scotus's *Opus Oxoniense* and *Quodlibetal Questions* establish freedom's essence as *self-determination* (*indeterminatio*), not merely choosing between alternatives but causing one's own choices. His principle of *haecceity* (thisness) grounds individual particularity in irreducible singularity, protecting creaturely freedom from reduction to universal necessities. Scotus argued the will possesses *potentia absoluta*—absolute power to will otherwise—even while choosing, making every free act contingent. His *univocity of being* doctrine asserts God and creatures share being's concept, though not degree, allowing genuine creaturely causation without divine determination.

Ockham radicalized Scotus's voluntarism, distinguishing God's *potentia absoluta* (what God could do by absolute power) from *potentia ordinata* (what God has chosen to do through established order). This preserves divine freedom to act otherwise while maintaining created order's stability. His nominalism denies universal natures determining particular actions, grounding freedom in individual wills unbound by abstract essences. The *Sentences* commentaries elaborate how divine foreknowledge occurs through eternal present, not causal determination.

Internal debates address whether Scotian synchronic contingency (ability to will otherwise at the moment of willing) implies libertarian indeterminism or subtle compatibilism. Some contemporary Franciscans integrate evolutionary science while preserving contingency through quantum indeterminacy. Thomistic critics charge voluntarism makes divine action arbitrary, lacking rational foundation, while Calvinists consider libertarian freedom incompatible with divine sovereignty.

Contemporary applications include personalist ethics emphasizing irreducible dignity, ecological theology grounding creation care in contingency's giftedness, and dialogue with analytic philosophy of action. The tradition influenced phenomenology's emphasis on intentional consciousness and existentialism's radical freedom. Comparative analysis reveals parallels with Islamic Ash'arite occasionalism and Buddhist concept of dependent origination, though Franciscans uniquely combine metaphysical contingency with Christological love. Unlike necessitarian traditions subordinating freedom to rational order, Franciscan voluntarism establishes will's primacy while risking charges of irrationalism from intellectualist opponents.

*** 1.22.17 Dominican Response

Dominican theology synthesizes freedom and determinism through Thomistic intellectualism, wherein rational understanding perfects voluntary action within divine providence's comprehensive ordering. Founded by Dominic de Guzmán (1170-1221) for preaching and doctrinal precision, the Order of Preachers developed systematic accounts of freedom through Thomas Aquinas's (1225-1274) integration of Aristotelian causation with Christian revelation, establishing rational necessity's compatibility with genuine human agency.

Aquinas's *Summa Theologiae* articulates freedom as *liberum arbitrium* (free judgment), whereby intellect presents goods to will, which chooses through rational deliberation. His doctrine of *intellectualism* subordinates will to intellect's apprehension of truth—the will necessarily desires happiness but freely chooses particular goods through practical reason's mediation. The *prima pars* establishes God as primary cause operating through secondary causes (creatures) who act according to their natures. Divine motion actualizes creaturely potencies without violating their proper causality; God's transcendence as *actus purus* (pure act) enables immanent operation within creation.

Domingo Báñez (1528-1604) developed *praemotio physica* (physical premotion) doctrine: God's grace efficaciously moves will to act freely, distinguishing sufficient grace (providing ability) from efficacious grace (producing consent). His *Concordia* defends Thomistic predestination against Molinist middle knowledge, maintaining God's sovereign decree determines salvation while preserving human moral responsibility through intrinsic rather than extrinsic predetermination. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange's twentieth-century Thomism articulated strict intellectualism against modern voluntarism.

Internal debates address whether physical premotion implies theological determinism. Thomists distinguish *necessitas consequentis* (consequent necessity—the act must happen) from *necessitas consequentiae* (conditional necessity—if God wills it, it happens)—affirming only the latter. Some contemporary Dominicans incorporate evolutionary psychology while maintaining rational deliberation's irreducibility to neural determinism.

Jesuit critics charge physical premotion destroys genuine freedom, while Franciscan voluntarists reject intellectualism's subordination of will to rational necessity. Calvinist critics consider Thomistic freedom Pelagian compromise, granting creatures autonomous causation. Contemporary applications include natural law ethics grounding moral obligation in rational nature, virtue theory emphasizing habitual perfection of rational appetite, and dialogue with cognitive science. The tradition influenced medieval scholasticism and neo-scholasticism. Unlike occasionalist denial of secondary causation or libertarian indeterminism, Dominican Thomism establishes freedom through rational participation in divine providence's ordering wisdom.

*** 1.22.18 Jesuit Response

Jesuit theology addresses freedom and determinism through Luis de Molina's (1535-1600) *scientia media* (middle knowledge), proposing God knows all possible free actions creatures might perform in any circumstance, reconciling comprehensive divine knowledge with genuine libertarian freedom. Founded by Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) emphasizing spiritual discernment and missionary adaptability, the Society of Jesus developed sophisticated defenses of human cooperation with grace against Calvinist and Thomistic determinism.

Molina's *Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis* (1588) distinguishes three types of divine knowledge: *scientia naturalis* (natural knowledge of all possibilities), *scientia media* (middle knowledge of what free creatures would choose in any circumstance), and *scientia libera* (free knowledge of what will actually occur given God's creative decree). Middle knowledge occurs logically between God's knowledge of possibilities and His creative decision, allowing Him to arrange circumstances eliciting desired free responses without determining choices. This preserves libertarian freedom—the power of contrary choice—while maintaining providence's meticulous sovereignty.

Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) elaborated *concursus simultaneus* (simultaneous concurrence) as alternative to Dominican physical premotion: God's causal influence operates simultaneously with creaturely action, neither predetermining nor merely permitting but actively cooperating while respecting libertarian freedom. His *Disputationes Metaphysicae* grounds freedom in will's indifference—genuine alternatives between which the will chooses without prior determining factors. The *Spiritual Exercises* embody Jesuit emphasis on discernment, presuming humans can genuinely cooperate with or resist divine inspiration.

Internal debates address whether middle knowledge grants creatures autonomous causation independent of divine determination. The *Congregatio de Auxiliis* (1597-1607) adjudicated Jesuit-Dominican controversy without definitive resolution, Pope Paul V forbidding each side from condemning the other. Contemporary Jesuits incorporate psychological freedom research while maintaining theological libertarianism.

Dominican critics charge Molinism makes God dependent on creaturely choices logically prior to His creative decree, compromising sovereignty. Reformed theologians reject middle knowledge as incoherent—truly free acts possess no explanatory grounding even in counterfactual circumstances. Open theists claim middle knowledge implies determinism through divine circumstantial manipulation. Contemporary applications include open theology dialogue, philosophical free will debates, and providence theodicy addressing evil's permission without causation. The tradition influenced Arminianism and modern analytical theology. Unlike Thomistic intellectualism or Calvinist sovereignty, Jesuit Molinism maximizes both divine control and human autonomy through middle knowledge's logical priority.

*** 1.22.19 Carmelite Response

Carmelite spirituality approaches freedom through mystical transformation, wherein contemplative union with God liberates the soul from disordered attachments, establishing freedom as progressive purification culminating in transforming union where human will operates in perfect harmony with divine will. Emerging from hermits on Mount Carmel in the twelfth century and reformed by Teresa of Ávila (1515-1582) and John of the Cross (1542-1591), the tradition understands freedom not as mere choice between alternatives but as capacity for God achieved through ascetical discipline and passive divine action.

John's *Ascent of Mount Carmel* and *Dark Night of the Soul* articulate freedom's realization through *noche oscura* (dark night)—periods of divine purgation stripping attachments to created goods and even spiritual consolations. His doctrine of *nada* (nothingness) requires renunciation of all creaturely desires to achieve *todo* (everything) in God. Teresa's *Interior Castle* maps seven mansions representing progressive intimacy with God, wherein freedom increases paradoxically through surrender. Her distinction between *arrobamiento* (rapture—involuntary suspension of faculties) and *unión* (union—voluntary cooperation with grace) acknowledges both passive reception and active assent.

The tradition integrates Thomistic metaphysics with experiential knowledge (*conocimiento experimental*) derived from contemplative practice. Carmelites distinguish initial freedom of choice (*libertas contradictionis*)—selecting between good and evil—from perfected freedom (*libertas complacentiae*)—spontaneous alignment with divine will. Thérèse of Lisieux's (1873-1897) *"little way"* democratized mysticism, showing ordinary Christians achieve freedom through confident abandonment to divine mercy rather than heroic asceticism.

Internal debates address whether mystical experiences involve supernatural infusion or natural psychological processes. Quietist controversies questioned whether pure passivity negates human cooperation. Contemporary Carmelites integrate contemplative practice with social justice, following Edith Stein's (1891-1942) personalist phenomenology uniting mysticism with philosophical anthropology.

Critics from active apostolic orders question contemplative withdrawal's efficacy, while Protestant suspicion of merit-based spirituality challenges Carmelite ascetical rigor. Thomistic intellectualists distinguish rational deliberation from affective mysticism. Contemporary applications include contemplative prayer movements, spiritual direction emphasizing discernment, and dialogue with Buddhist meditation. The tradition influenced French spiritual school and Salesian spirituality. Unlike libertarian focus on choice between alternatives or determinist emphasis on causal necessity, Carmelite mysticism locates freedom in transformative union transcending choice through love's perfect conformity to divine will.

*** 1.22.20 Benedictine Response

Benedictine monasticism articulates freedom through *stabilitas* (stability), *conversatio morum* (conversion of life), and *obedientia* (obedience)—vows establishing communal discipline as context for liberating human will from egoistic tyranny. Founded by Benedict of Nursia (c.480-547) whose *Rule* shaped Western monasticism, the tradition understands freedom not as autonomy but as ordered liberty within common life, liturgical rhythm (*opus Dei*), and manual labor (*ora et labora*).

The *Rule of Saint Benedict* balances authority and discretion, granting abbots paternal governance while requiring consultation with community. Chapter 5 on obedience establishes freedom paradoxically through submission: "The first degree of humility is prompt obedience...they live not by their own judgment nor obey their own desires and pleasures, but walk according to another's judgment and command." This counters modern autonomy celebrating independent choice, proposing instead that disordered self-will enslaves while disciplined communal formation liberates for genuine relationship with God.

Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109), Benedictine Archbishop, developed sophisticated freedom doctrine in *De Libertate Arbitrii*: freedom constitutes *rectitudo voluntatis propter se servata* (uprightness of will preserved for its own sake). True freedom maintains moral rectitude regardless of external compulsion or pleasure, distinguishing *libertas a necessitate* (freedom from necessity of sinning) from *libertas a coactione* (freedom from external compulsion). Only prelapsarian humans and unfallen angels possess complete freedom; postlapsarian humans require grace restoring capacity for moral goodness.

Internal debates address tension between Benedictine obedience and modern emphasis on individual conscience. Liturgical renewal movements emphasized active participation versus contemplative receptivity. Contemporary Benedictines integrate psychological understanding of human development with traditional formation, recognizing freedom emerges through gradual habituation rather than instantaneous decision.

Protestant critics charge monastic vows undermine Christian liberty, while libertarian philosophers reject obedience as freedom's antithesis. Voluntarist critics question whether rectitude determined by divine command allows genuine self-determination. Contemporary applications include intentional Christian communities, liturgical spirituality emphasizing rhythm over spontaneity, and ecological theology through Benedictine *stabilitas* fostering place-based commitment. The tradition influenced Cluniac and Cistercian reforms. Comparative analysis reveals parallels with Confucian *li* (ritual propriety) and Buddhist monastic discipline. Unlike individualist libertarianism celebrating autonomous choice, Benedictine freedom emerges through communal formation and liturgical rhythm establishing conditions for authentic self-transcendence.

*** 1.22.21 Baptist Response

Baptist theology champions *soul liberty*—the competency of every individual before God to interpret Scripture and respond to divine grace without ecclesiastical mediation—establishing freedom as theological first principle grounding religious liberty, voluntary church membership, and believer's baptism. Emerging from English Separatism in early seventeenth century through John Smyth (1570-1612) and Thomas Helwys (1575-1616), Baptists prioritized freedom of conscience against both Catholic hierarchy and Reformed magisterial authority.

The tradition bifurcated into General Baptists, following Arminian soteriology affirming universal atonement and libertarian free will, and Particular Baptists, embracing Calvinist predestination while maintaining soul competency. The *First London Confession* (1644) of Particular Baptists affirms compatibilist freedom: humans "have no power to will any spiritual good...yet man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath not lost a natural faculty of will." This preserves moral agency within comprehensive divine sovereignty. Conversely, the *Orthodox Creed* (1678) of General Baptists declares humans "endued with freedom of will" to accept or reject grace.

Roger Williams (1603-1683) pioneered religious liberty arguments, establishing Rhode Island as haven for freedom of conscience. His distinction between civil and religious spheres limited government coercion to civil order, protecting individual religious choice. The *Charleston Summary* (1767) and *New Hampshire Confession* (1833) systematized Baptist convictions emphasizing personal conversion requiring free decision. E.Y. Mullins's (1860-1928) *Axioms of Religion* articulated soul competency as organizing principle balancing individual liberty with biblical authority.

Internal tensions persist between Calvinist and Arminian Baptists regarding predestination's compatibility with free will. Landmarkism asserted Baptist ecclesiological distinctiveness, while mainstream Baptists emphasized broader evangelical cooperation. The Conservative Resurgence in Southern Baptist Convention (1979-1990s) debated biblical inerrancy's implications for freedom of interpretation.

Reformed critics charge soul competency promotes interpretive chaos and doctrinal relativism, while Catholics consider rejection of ecclesiastical authority prideful individualism. Calvinist Baptists distinguish soul liberty (freedom of conscience before God) from libertarian metaphysics (power of contrary choice). Contemporary applications include religious freedom advocacy, separation of church and state, and autonomous local congregation governance. The tradition influenced American voluntarism and religious pluralism. Unlike traditions grounding authority in ecclesiastical hierarchy or confessional subscription, Baptist soul liberty establishes individual conscience's primacy while affirming Scripture's supreme authority.

*** 1.22.22 Methodist/Wesleyan Response

Methodist theology articulates *prevenient grace*—God's prior gracious initiative enabling human response—establishing synergistic cooperation between divine sovereignty and human freedom within *via salutis* (way of salvation) emphasizing progressive sanctification. Founded by John Wesley (1703-1791) and Charles Wesley (1707-1788) within Anglican context, Methodism rejected both Calvinist determinism and Pelagian self-sufficiency through Arminian soteriology emphasizing universal atonement and resistible grace.

Wesley's doctrine of prevenient grace, elaborated in his sermon "On Working Out Our Own Salvation" (1785), asserts fallen humans possess no natural capacity for spiritual good, yet God universally extends grace restoring libertarian freedom to accept or reject salvation. This distinguishes Wesleyan theology from Pelagianism (which affirms natural capacity) and Calvinism (which limits grace to elect). His *Notes on the New Testament* interpret Romans 9 through corporate election and temporal service rather than individual predestination to damnation. The doctrine of *entire sanctification* or "perfect love" posits postconversion freedom from voluntary sin through Holy Spirit's complete transformation.

Wesley's synthesis appears in tension: he affirmed divine foreknowledge, universal providence, and predestination unto holiness while rejecting unconditional election and irresistible grace. His "Thoughts on Necessity" (1774) defended libertarian freedom against philosophical determinism, arguing moral responsibility requires power of contrary choice. The *Minutes of Several Conversations* (1744-1789) and *Standard Sermons* establish Wesleyan doctrinal standards balancing divine initiative with human cooperation.

Internal debates address whether entire sanctification occurs instantaneously or gradually, and whether sinless perfection constitutes realistic expectation or theological ideal. Holiness Movement radicalized Wesley's sanctification emphasis, while some contemporary Methodists adopt open theism rejecting comprehensive divine foreknowledge. The Free Methodist and Wesleyan Methodist denominations emerged emphasizing abolitionism and holiness.

Calvinist critics charge Wesleyan synergism makes salvation ultimately dependent on human decision, compromising *sola gratia*. Process theologians consider divine persuasion without coercion insufficient for sovereignty. Contemporary applications include optimistic anthropology informing social reform, addiction recovery through Celebrate Recovery, and global Pentecostal-Wesleyan convergence. The tradition influenced holiness and Pentecostal movements. Comparative analysis reveals parallels with Eastern Orthodox synergism and Catholic cooperation with grace. Unlike Reformed monergism or Pelagian autonomy, Wesleyan prevenient grace establishes universal grace enabling genuine libertarian response within framework of divine initiative.

*** 1.22.23 Holiness Movement Response

The Holiness Movement articulates freedom through *entire sanctification*—postconversion second crisis experience eradicating inherited depravity and liberating from voluntary sin's dominion—establishing Christian perfection as accessible norm rather than exceptional mystical achievement. Emerging from nineteenth-century Methodist revivalism through Phoebe Palmer (1807-1874) and institutionalized in denominations like Church of the Nazarene and Wesleyan Church, the movement radicalized Wesley's doctrine of perfect love into democratized expectation for all believers.

Palmer's *The Way of Holiness* (1843) simplified Wesley's sanctification theology through "shorter way" bypassing gradual growth for immediate consecration and faith. Her "altar theology" applied Levitical imagery: complete surrender placing oneself on God's altar results in instantaneous cleansing. The movement distinguished *justification* (pardon from sin's guilt) from *sanctification* (cleansing from sin's pollution), typically viewing the latter as crisis experience subsequent to conversion. This "second blessing" theology promised freedom from inbred sin (*carnality*) remaining after justification, though not from involuntary mistakes or physiological limitations.

The movement integrated Wesleyan Arminianism with American revivalist emotionalism and democratic accessibility. Camp meetings, protracted revivals, and altar calls provided contexts for public consecration. Holiness theologians like Daniel Steele (1824-1914) and H. Orton Wiley (1877-1961) systematized the doctrine, distinguishing entire sanctification from glorification (ultimate perfection at death) and from sinless perfection in degree rather than kind. They emphasized love's supremacy over legal righteousness, perfect intentions over absolute performance.

Internal debates addressed whether sanctification eliminates sinful temptations or only power to sin, whether it occurs instantaneously or gradually, and whether subsequent sins prove one never received entire sanctification or demonstrate the need for continued cleansing. The movement spawned diverse expressions including Keswick holiness emphasizing Spirit baptism for service over sinless perfection.

Calvinist critics charge entire sanctification denies total depravity and promotes pharisaical pride. Lutheran critics consider it works righteousness denying *simul justus et peccator*. Pentecostal descendants reinterpreted second blessing as Spirit baptism with tongues evidence rather than moral perfection. Contemporary applications include Wesleyan-holiness denominations, Christian higher education emphasizing character formation, and global holiness-Pentecostal synthesis. The tradition influenced Pentecostalism and Keswick convention movement. Unlike Reformed progressive sanctification gradual until death or Catholic meritorious cooperation, Holiness entire sanctification promises crisis liberation accessible to all believers through consecrated faith.

*** 1.22.24 Quaker Response

Quaker theology locates freedom in *Inner Light*—the universal divine presence within every person enabling direct unmediated communion with God apart from external religious authorities, rituals, or Scripture as final authority. Founded by George Fox (1624-1691) amidst English Civil War's religious upheaval, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) radically democratized Christianity through immediate revelation accessible to all regardless of education, gender, or social status, challenging deterministic Calvinist predestination dominant in Puritan England.

Fox's *Journal* recounts mystical experiences establishing conviction that Christ teaches His people directly through inward voice. His doctrine of Inner Light or "that of God in everyone" asserts universal grace preceding and enabling response to Christ's direct teaching. This establishes libertarian freedom rooted in divine image persisting despite fall—humanity retains capacity to perceive and obey divine promptings. Robert Barclay's *Apology for the True Christian Divinity* (1676), the movement's closest approximation to systematic theology, articulates how Inner Light illuminates conscience, making Scripture's meaning accessible and providing continuing revelation beyond biblical canon.

The tradition developed distinctive practices embodying freedom: unprogrammed worship without liturgy or clergy, where participants speak as Spirit leads; consensus decision-making in business meetings seeking corporate discernment rather than majority vote; refusal of oaths asserting speech's inherent truthfulness; peace testimony rejecting violence based on divine image in all persons. These practices presume human capacity for divine perception and voluntary cooperation with inward Teacher.

Internal diversity spans from evangelical Friends embracing biblical authority and pastoral leadership to liberal Friends minimizing distinctive Christian content, emphasizing universal divine light in all religions. The Richmond Declaration (1887) attempted doctrinal standardization, sparking controversy between evangelical and liberal wings. Hicksite-Orthodox split (1827) divided Friends over authority of Inner Light versus Scripture, spiritual versus evangelical emphasis.

Calvinist critics charge Inner Light constitutes Pelagian confidence in natural capacity, while Catholic critics consider rejection of external authority prideful enthusiasm. Cessationists deny continuing revelation beyond Scripture. Contemporary applications include nonviolent activism through American Friends Service Committee, consensus-based governance models, and contemplative spirituality emphasizing silence. The tradition influenced abolitionism, women's rights, and peace movements. Comparative analysis reveals parallels with Stoic divine reason and Hindu *atman*. Unlike traditions emphasizing external revelation, ecclesial mediation, or sovereign predetermination, Quaker Inner Light establishes immediate divine-human encounter as freedom's foundation.

*** 1.22.25 Seventh-day Adventist Response

Seventh-day Adventist theology articulates freedom through *investigative judgment*—an ongoing heavenly process since 1844 wherein Christ examines professed believers' lives to determine salvation fitness—establishing synergistic cooperation between divine sovereignty and human moral agency within cosmic conflict framework. Founded by Ellen G. White (1827-1915) and systematized through 28 Fundamental Beliefs, Adventism developed from Millerite disappointment into comprehensive worldview integrating Arminian soteriology with apocalyptic urgency and distinctive practices including Sabbath observance and health reform.

White's *The Great Controversy* articulates cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan as metanarrative explaining evil, suffering, and human freedom. God granted angels and humans libertarian freedom to ensure genuine love rather than coerced obedience. Satan's rebellion initiated cosmic litigation questioning divine character's justice, resolved through Christ's demonstration of self-sacrificial love and vindication of God's law. Humans participate in this controversy through choosing obedience or rebellion, their choices demonstrating God's government's fairness before watching universe.

The doctrine of investigative judgment, derived from Daniel 8:14 ("unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed"), asserts Christ entered heavenly sanctuary's Most Holy Place in 1844, beginning final phase of atonement wherein believers' lives are examined against divine law's standard. This establishes freedom's ultimate accountability—salvation requires both faith in Christ's atonement and Spirit-enabled obedience demonstrating faith's genuineness. Unlike Calvinist perseverance of saints guaranteeing elect's security or Lutheran *simul justus et peccator* accepting concurrent sinfulness, Adventist investigative judgment emphasizes progressive sanctification's necessity for eschatological vindication.

Adventist *conditional immortality* denies innate soul immortality, asserting death constitutes unconscious sleep until resurrection. This frames freedom within temporal existence—choices determine eternal destiny, but rejected experience annihilation rather than eternal conscious torment, preserving divine justice and love.

Internal debates address investigative judgment's relationship to gospel assurance—does ongoing examination undermine confidence in Christ's finished atonement? Progressive Adventists emphasize grace over legal perfectionism, while traditional voices maintain law's perpetual validity including Sabbath as seal of God. The Desmond Ford crisis (1980) questioned investigative judgment's biblical foundation, resulting in his dismissal.

Critics from Reformed theology charge investigative judgment constitutes works righteousness and compromises justification by faith alone. Mainstream evangelicals question 1844 date specificity and heavenly sanctuary literalism. Contemporary applications include health evangelism, educational institutions emphasizing holistic development, and humanitarian relief through Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA). The tradition influenced health reform and religious liberty advocacy. Unlike deterministic predestination or Pelagian autonomy, Adventist theology establishes libertarian freedom within cosmic conflict requiring demonstrated loyalty through Spirit-empowered obedience.

*** 1.22.26 Latter-day Saints (Mormon) Response

Latter-day Saint theology articulates freedom through *agency*—eternal capacity for self-determination predating mortal existence—establishing libertarian free will as necessary condition for moral development, eternal progression, and *theosis* (becoming like God). Founded by Joseph Smith (1805-1844) through claimed angelic revelations and golden plates translation producing the Book of Mormon, the tradition developed distinctive metaphysics wherein humans exist eternally as *intelligences* organized by God as spirit children, granted agency enabling progression or regression through choices.

The Book of Mormon's *2 Nephi 2:26-27* establishes agency's theological foundation: "men are free according to the flesh...they are free to choose liberty and eternal life...or to choose captivity and death." Lehi's discourse articulates necessity of opposition—good and evil, righteousness and sin—for meaningful choice. Without contraries, creation would be "compound in one," eliminating agency and reducing existence to "naught." This grounds freedom metaphysically rather than merely ethically, making opposites ontologically necessary for agency's operation.

Doctrine and Covenants section 93 reveals humans as co-eternal with God—"intelligence" neither created nor made exists eternally. God organizes intelligence into spirit bodies, grants mortal experience through physical birth, and offers exaltation (godhood) through covenant ordinances and righteous living. This establishes *eternal progression*—continuous advancement toward divine attributes through multiple estates (premortal, mortal, postmortal). Agency functions across estates: spirits chose to follow Christ or Lucifer in premortal Council in Heaven, mortality tests obedience through veil obscuring premortal memory, and postmortal existence continues progression.

Lorenzo Snow's couplet "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be" articulates ultimate freedom—potential divinity through eternal progression. This differs radically from traditional Christian *creatio ex nihilo* establishing ontological discontinuity between Creator and creation. LDS theology proposes continuity with quantitative rather than qualitative distinction between God and humans.

Internal debates address whether eternal intelligence implies autonomous existence independent of God, compromising divine sovereignty. Some contemporary LDS scholars adopt social trinitarianism emphasizing three distinct Gods united in purpose, while traditionalists maintain ambiguity. The "King Follett Discourse" (1844) presented most explicit *finite godism*—God progressed to divinity through prior existence—sparking ongoing discussion about God's nature.

Critics from traditional Christianity charge LDS theology with polytheism and Pelagian self-deification. Reformed theologians reject libertarian agency as incompatible with divine sovereignty. Process theologians appreciate LDS eternal progress but question theistic finitude's adequacy. Contemporary applications include strong family emphasis, missionary work establishing global presence, and genealogical research enabling proxy temple ordinances for deceased. The tradition developed unique theodicy—evil results from agency's misuse, not divine permission or plan. Unlike Calvinist determinism or Catholic mediated grace, LDS agency establishes eternal libertarian freedom necessary for progression toward divinity.

*** 1.22.27 Jehovah's Witnesses Response

Jehovah's Witnesses articulate freedom through theocratic submission wherein genuine liberty emerges from voluntary alignment with Jehovah God's sovereignty as mediated through the Watch Tower organization's biblical interpretation. Founded by Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916) and institutionalized under Joseph Rutherford (1869-1942) and subsequent Governing Body leadership, the tradition developed distinctive eschatology and ecclesiology emphasizing obedience to divine government as path to freedom from Satan's world system.

The organization's flagship publication *The Watchtower* and systematic theology *Insight on the Scriptures* articulate how Adam's rebellion forfeited perfect freedom, subjecting humanity to inherited sin and Satanic deception. God granted humans free will demonstrated by Eden's choice—perfect creatures possessed libertarian capacity to obey or rebel. The consequences established precedent: misused freedom produces enslavement to sin, death, and demonic influence. Restoration requires submission to Jehovah's theocratic rule, implemented progressively through biblical covenants and ultimately through Christ's millennial kingdom.

Jehovah's Witnesses reject Trinity doctrine, understanding Jesus as Michael the Archangel, God's first creation through whom all else came into being. Christ's ransom sacrifice provides exact correspondence (*antilutron*) to Adam's perfect life forfeited through disobedience, enabling humans to regain freedom from sin and death. However, freedom's restoration requires active cooperation—baptism into organization, regular meeting attendance, field service proclaiming kingdom message, and submission to Governing Body's direction as God's channel.

The tradition's eschatology establishes freedom within corporate framework rather than individual salvation. The 144,000 *anointed class* receive heavenly reward ruling with Christ, while *great crowd* enjoys earthly paradise after Armageddon. This corporate emphasis subordinates individual choice to organizational loyalty—freedom consists in voluntarily accepting theocratic structure rather than autonomous decision-making. Disfellowshipping (excommunication) and shunning enforce boundaries, protecting congregation purity while pressuring compliance.

Internal debates rarely surface publicly given organizational control of information. The 1975 Armageddon prediction's failure prompted reexamination of date-setting, while blood transfusion prohibition continues generating controversy despite allowance of blood fractions. Some former members characterize governance as authoritarian control contradicting proclaimed freedom.

Critics from mainstream Christianity charge legalistic works righteousness and cultic control mechanisms. Mental health professionals note restrictive practices including limited higher education, secular career discouragement, and social isolation from non-Witnesses. Reformed theologians reject anthropology affirming human capacity for righteous obedience. Contemporary applications include extensive publishing operation, door-to-door evangelism, and global kingdom hall construction. The tradition parallels other restorationist movements emphasizing apostolic pattern recovery. Unlike traditions emphasizing individual conscience or mystical union, Jehovah's Witnesses locate freedom in theocratic submission mediated through organizational hierarchy claiming exclusive interpretive authority.

*** 1.22.28 Christian Science Response

Christian Science articulates freedom through denial of matter's reality and affirmation of Mind's primacy, wherein true liberty emerges through understanding that sin, sickness, and death constitute mental errors corrected through spiritual comprehension rather than material processes. Founded by Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910) through her textbook *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures* (1875), the tradition developed radical idealist metaphysics dissolving materialist determinism by asserting only Mind (God) and its ideas exist substantially.

Eddy's central insight crystallized following fall on ice (1866): healing occurred through spiritual realization, not physiological process. This suggested matter lacks causal power, operating merely as mental projection. *Science and Health* systematically elaborates how mortal mind generates illusory material existence while immortal Mind constitutes sole reality. Her "scientific statement of being" declares: "There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation." This establishes freedom metaphysically—material determinism cannot bind because matter is mental error.

The tradition distinguishes mortal mind (source of false material perception) from divine Mind (God, sole reality). Sin, disease, and death represent mortal mind's mistaken beliefs, not objective conditions. Healing occurs through *demonstration*—practical proof that spiritual truth overcomes material limitation. Christian Science practitioners facilitate healing through prayerful recognition of spiritual reality, denying matter's claims. Eddy's soteriology reinterprets atonement as *at-one-ment*—recognizing eternal unity with God through Christ's demonstration of matter's unreality and Mind's supremacy.

Free will operates within this framework as capacity to align thought with divine Mind or indulge mortal mind's illusions. Since matter doesn't exist substantially, deterministic laws governing physical processes constitute false belief systems overcome through spiritual understanding. The tradition developed distinctive practices including reliance on prayer rather than medicine, Wednesday testimony meetings sharing healing demonstrations, and Reading Rooms providing access to Eddy's writings.

Internal debates have been minimal given centralized textual authority—Eddy's writings establish doctrine with limited interpretive development. The Church Manual she authored governs organizational structure strictly. Some contemporary practitioners integrate selective medical intervention while maintaining idealist metaphysics, though orthodox position rejects medical treatment as affirming matter's reality.

Critics from medical establishment charge Christian Science with dangerous rejection of proven treatments, resulting in preventable deaths especially among children. Philosophers question coherent idealism dismissing matter while engaging apparent physical world. Christians charge Eddy with Gnostic dualism and heterodox Christology denying incarnation's material reality. Contemporary applications include spiritual healing testimonials published in *Christian Science Journal*, reading rooms in urban centers, and *Christian Science Monitor* newspaper emphasizing thoughtful journalism. The tradition parallels New Thought and mind-cure movements. Comparative analysis reveals similarities with Advaita Vedanta's maya (illusion) doctrine and Berkeley's idealism. Unlike compatibilist or libertarian frameworks presuming material causation, Christian Science dissolves freedom-determinism problem by denying material reality's substantial existence.

*** 1.22.29 Unitarian Universalist Response

Unitarian Universalism approaches freedom through radical affirmation of individual conscience and theological pluralism, rejecting predetermined doctrines and establishing ongoing personal inquiry as religious norm. Emerging from separate movements—Unitarianism denying Trinity and affirming divine unity, Universalism affirming universal salvation—that merged in 1961, the tradition evolved from Christian liberalism into post-Christian pluralism embracing diverse spiritual sources while centering human dignity and rational freedom.

William Ellery Channing's (1780-1842) "Unitarian Christianity" sermon (1819) established rational freedom's primacy over creedal authority, asserting humans possess God-given reason capable of understanding Scripture without ecclesiastical mediation. His emphasis on divine benevolence rejected Calvinist doctrines of total depravity and predestination as incompatible with moral rationality. Universalist theologian Hosea Ballou (1771-1852) articulated universal reconciliation in *Treatise on Atonement* (1805), denying eternal punishment as incompatible with divine love and human dignity.

The tradition's "Seven Principles" adopted in 1985 affirm "inherent worth and dignity of every person" and "free and responsible search for truth and meaning," enshrining libertarian freedom as theological foundation. Unlike traditions grounding freedom in divine revelation or natural law, UU locates authority in individual conscience informed by diverse sources including "direct experience of transcending mystery," "words and deeds of prophetic people," "wisdom from world religions," "Jewish and Christian teachings," "humanist teachings," and "spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions."

This radical pluralism generates internal diversity spanning Christian theists, humanist atheists, Buddhist practitioners, and pagan nature worshipers united by covenant rather than creed. The tradition's principle of free pulpit protects ministers' right to preach according to conscience, while free pew principle protects congregants' right to personal belief. Theological freedom functions as organizing principle, creating community through shared commitment to search rather than arrival at fixed conclusions.

Critics charge UU with incoherent eclecticism lacking substantive convictions. Traditional Christians consider rejection of core doctrines—Trinity, Christ's divinity, scriptural authority—as abandoning Christianity entirely. Philosophical critics question whether radical pluralism provides sufficient ethical guidance or devolves into relativism. Internal debates address whether tradition's openness permits conservative theology or implicitly requires progressive politics and theology.

Contemporary applications include social justice activism on LGBTQ+ rights, environmental sustainability, racial justice, and reproductive freedom. The tradition influenced Transcendentalism and American religious liberalism. Comparative analysis reveals parallels with Enlightenment rationalism and postmodern pluralism. Unlike traditions proposing specific salvation mechanisms or moral codes derived from divine command, UU establishes freedom through rejecting predetermined answers, making religious journey itself rather than doctrinal conformity the tradition's essence. Whether this constitutes authentic tradition or meta-tradition encompassing multiple traditions remains contested both internally and externally.

*** 1.22.30 Process Theology Response

Process theology reconceptualizes freedom and determinism through Alfred North Whitehead's (1861-1947) process metaphysics, proposing reality consists of momentary events (*actual occasions*) self-creating through incorporating past influences and responding to divine persuasion, establishing mutual freedom wherein God influences but cannot coerce creaturely decisions while creatures contribute to divine experience. Developed primarily through Charles Hartshorne (1897-2000), John Cobb Jr. (b.1925), and other scholars applying Whitehead's philosophy to Christian theology, the tradition offers radical alternative to classical theism's omnipotent deity determining creaturely actions.

Whitehead's *Process and Reality* (1929) articulates how actual occasions possess intrinsic *self-causation* through their subjective aim—internal teleology directing how entity integrates objective data (past events) into subjective satisfaction (present becoming). God functions as cosmic source of possibilities (*eternal objects*) offered to each occasion, providing initial aim proposing optimal possibility given that occasion's circumstances. However, occasions possess genuine freedom to modify initial aim, making God's influence persuasive rather than coercive. This establishes *panentheism*—God contains world (world exists in God) yet exceeds it, experiencing world's becoming through *consequent nature* while offering possibilities through *primordial nature*.

Hartshorne's *dipolar theism* distinguishes God's abstract essence (eternal, necessary, unchanging) from concrete actuality (temporal, contingent, growing through incorporating world's experiences). This resolves traditional problem of divine immutability—God's essential character remains constant while divine experience changes through responsive love. Freedom operates reciprocally: creatures genuinely affect God, contributing to divine life, while God's persuasive lure directs creation toward beauty, intensity, and harmony without determining outcomes.

Process theology rejects *creatio ex nihilo* (creation from nothing), proposing God creates through organizing preexistent creativity rather than generating being from non-being. This limits divine power—God cannot prevent evil through unilateral action but only persuade toward good. The tradition developed innovative theodicy: evil results from creaturely freedom misusing divine possibilities, yet God suffers with creation, sharing creatures' experiences while working persuasively toward redemption.

Internal debates address whether process metaphysics adequately accounts for God's biblical activity including miracles, whether persuasive deity warrants worship, and whether eternal objects require personal God or could exist independently. Open theism appropriated some process insights while maintaining stronger divine sovereignty than classical process theology allows.

Critics from classical theism charge process theology with compromising divine sovereignty, aseity, and immutability, reducing God to finite being dependent on world. Reformed theologians reject denial of *creatio ex nihilo* and divine omnipotence. Thomists argue process metaphysics conflates potency with actuality. Contemporary applications include ecological theology emphasizing divine immanence in nature, feminist theology appreciating God's receptivity and vulnerability, and comparative theology finding resonances with Buddhist interdependence. The tradition influenced Whiteheadian philosophy of religion and relational theologies. Unlike compatibilism preserving divine determinism or libertarianism within classical theism, process theology proposes mutual freedom wherein both God and creatures possess genuine agency within metaphysics of creative becoming.
