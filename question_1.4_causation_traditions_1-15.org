* Question 1.4: What is the nature of causation?

*** 1.4.1 Catholic Response

Catholic theology affirms hierarchical causation where God operates as the primary cause while creatures function as genuine secondary causes, preserving both divine sovereignty and creaturely agency through the doctrine of concurrence. This understanding emerged through Scholastic synthesis, particularly Thomas Aquinas's integration of Aristotelian philosophy with Christian revelation in the *Summa Theologica* (1265-1274), building on Augustine's earlier reflections on divine providence. The Second Vatican Council's *Gaudium et Spes* (1965) reaffirmed this balanced approach, emphasizing human participation in divine causality.

The philosophical foundation rests on Aquinas's distinction between primary and secondary causation. God as *Causa Prima* operates on a fundamentally different metaphysical level than created causes, sustaining all creaturely causation while permitting genuine efficacy to secondary causes. Aquinas argues in *Summa Theologica* I, q.105, a.5 that "God works in every agent" yet creatures truly act according to their natures. This preserves both transcendence and immanence without reducing creation to divine puppetry or deistic detachment.

Two core arguments support this position. First, the principle of analogy: causation in creatures participates analogically in divine causation, neither univocally identical nor equivocally unrelated. Second, the perfection argument: God's power is demonstrated not by eliminating creaturely causation but by enabling creatures to be genuine causes, reflecting divine generosity (*Summa Contra Gentiles* III, 70). Scripture supports this in Philippians 2:12-13, where human action and divine working coexist without contradiction.

Internal variations exist between Thomistic, Scotistic, and Molinist accounts of divine concurrence. Molinism, developed by Luis de Molina (1588), introduces middle knowledge to preserve libertarian free will, while Thomists like Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange (1925) defend physical premotion as necessary for creaturely action. Both agree on genuine secondary causation but differ on its metaphysical mechanics.

Critics charge that any divine causal involvement compromises human freedom or makes God responsible for evil. Catholic theology responds by distinguishing God's permission of evil from its causation, and by maintaining that divine causation actualizes creaturely freedom rather than negating it. Contemporary applications appear in bioethics debates where natural processes and human intervention both possess moral significance, and in ecological theology where creatures cooperate in ongoing creation. Compared to Reformed determinism and process theology's persuasive deity, Catholicism maintains a middle position affirming both divine sovereignty and creaturely autonomy through participatory causation.

*** 1.4.2 Protestant (Reformed) Response

Reformed theology teaches comprehensive divine causation wherein God sovereignly ordains whatsoever comes to pass, including all secondary causes, while maintaining that human beings exercise responsible agency within God's eternal decree. This position crystallized through John Calvin's *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (1559), which systematized earlier insights from Augustine on predestination and providence. The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) definitively articulated this view in Chapter 3, declaring God "from all eternity did...freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass," while Chapter 5 affirms secondary causes operate under divine providence.

The theological foundation rests on God's absolute sovereignty and meticulous providence. Calvin argues in *Institutes* I.16.3 that attributing events to fortune or contingency dishonors divine governance. Jonathan Edwards in *Freedom of the Will* (1754) provided philosophical sophistication, arguing that true freedom consists in acting according to one's strongest desire, which God ordains without coercion. This compatibilist framework maintains both comprehensive divine determination and genuine human responsibility.

Two primary arguments support Reformed causation. First, the sovereignty argument: if anything occurs outside God's decree, His sovereignty is compromised and creatures become ultimate arbiters of reality. Second, the assurance argument: only comprehensive divine control guarantees that God's redemptive purposes will succeed (Romans 8:28-30). Edwards argued that necessary connection between motives and actions strengthens rather than weakens moral responsibility, since actions proceed from character.

Scripture is interpreted through this lens: Ephesians 1:11 teaches God "works all things according to the counsel of his will," while Acts 4:27-28 presents Herod and Pilate accomplishing "whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place." Proverbs 16:33 affirms divine control even over random events: "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord."

Internal variations include supralapsarian versus infralapsarian positions on the logical order of divine decrees, and debates over whether God merely permits or actively decrees sin. Amyraldism softens strict Calvinism by proposing hypothetical universalism. Critics charge that divine determinism negates meaningful human agency and makes God the author of sin. Reformed theologians respond by distinguishing primary from secondary causation and God's sovereign decree from human moral responsibility, maintained in compatibilist tension. Contemporary applications include theodicy discussions and debates over divine foreknowledge and prayer's efficacy. Compared to Arminian conditional causation and open theism's dynamic sovereignty, Reformed theology maximizes divine control while maintaining creaturely significance through asymmetrical compatibilism.

*** 1.4.3 Lutheran Response

Lutheran theology affirms paradoxical causation where God remains the sole efficient cause of salvation while human beings bear genuine responsibility for evil, refusing rational harmonization in favor of revelational tension preserved through the theology of the cross. Martin Luther's breakthrough came in his Romans lectures (1515-1516) and crystallized in *The Bondage of the Will* (1525) against Erasmus, arguing vehemently for divine monergism in salvation while maintaining human culpability for sin. The Formula of Concord (1577) Article II systematized this position, teaching that conversion is "purely the work of God alone" while damnation results from human resistance.

The theological framework employs dialectical tension between God's revealed will (desiring all to be saved, 1 Timothy 2:4) and His hidden will (sovereign election, Romans 9:15-18). Luther rejected philosophical attempts to reconcile these as presumptuous speculation, insisting believers embrace the paradox revealed in Scripture. This represents the theology of the cross (*theologia crucis*) over the theology of glory (*theologia gloriae*), accepting divine mystery rather than demanding rational comprehension.

Two core arguments structure Lutheran causation. First, the monergistic argument: fallen human will possesses no capacity for spiritual good (*servum arbitrium*), making God's unilateral action necessary for salvation. Luther argues in *Bondage of the Will* that if humans contribute anything to salvation, God's grace is negated and boasting remains possible. Second, the asymmetrical argument: good flows entirely from God's causation while evil results from human corruption, creating an asymmetry that resists logical synthesis but preserves both divine goodness and human responsibility.

Scripture grounds this position: John 1:13 teaches believers are "born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God," while John 3:19-20 places responsibility for condemnation on human rejection of light. Romans 9:16 declares salvation depends "not on human will or exertion, but on God who has mercy."

Internal variations include debates over whether God merely permits or ordains evil, with some Lutherans approaching Reformed determinism and others emphasizing libertarian rejection of grace. Nineteenth-century confessionalists like C.F.W. Walther maintained stricter boundaries against rationalization than mediating theologians. Critics charge logical incoherence in asymmetrical causation. Lutherans respond that divine mysteries transcend but don't contradict reason, and that pastoral certainty requires grounding salvation entirely in God's action while moral accountability requires genuine human agency. Contemporary applications include discussions of addiction and moral responsibility where deterministic and libertarian elements coexist. Compared to Reformed comprehensive determinism and Arminian synergism, Lutheranism maintains irreducible paradox, refusing philosophical resolution in favor of Scriptural fidelity and pastoral assurance through the theology of the cross.

*** 1.4.4 Anglican Response

Anglican theology embraces comprehensiveness regarding causation, holding together divine sovereignty and human freedom through via media that resists systematic reduction, valuing liturgical and pastoral wisdom over philosophical precision. This approach emerged from the English Reformation's unique character, reflected in the Thirty-Nine Articles (1571), particularly Article X on free will and Article XVII on predestination, which affirm both divine election and human responsibility without resolving their relationship systematically. Richard Hooker's *Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity* (1593-1662) established Anglican theological method prioritizing Scripture, tradition, and reason in dynamic interplay.

The theological foundation rests on sacramental ontology where divine and human causation interpenetrate through grace without either dominating. Unlike Reformed scholasticism or Tridentine precision, Anglicanism maintains studied ambiguity, allowing Reformed and Arminian interpretations to coexist within liturgical and episcopal unity. Caroline Divines like Lancelot Andrewes (1555-1626) emphasized patristic sources that balanced divine initiative and human response, while the Oxford Movement (1833-1845) recovered Catholic sacramentalism emphasizing instrumental causation through material means.

Two primary arguments characterize Anglican causation. First, the sacramental argument: God employs material causes as genuine instruments of grace, evidenced in baptismal regeneration and Eucharistic presence, demonstrating that divine and creaturely causation cooperate rather than compete. The Book of Common Prayer (1662) embodies this in its liturgical affirmations of baptismal efficacy and real presence. Second, the pastoral argument: systematic precision on causation generates division and spiritual anxiety, whereas liturgical participation in divine mysteries provides assurance without requiring metaphysical resolution.

Scripture is read through liturgical lenses: John 3:5 grounds baptismal regeneration, while Philippians 2:12-13 balances human effort and divine working. Article XVII affirms predestination for "godly persons" as source of comfort while warning against "curious and carnal" speculation into divine decrees. Article X teaches that fallen humans cannot turn to God "by our own natural strength and good works" without preventing grace, yet cooperate with subsequent grace.

Internal variations span the Protestant-Catholic spectrum, from evangelical Anglicans approximating Reformed theology to Anglo-Catholics embracing Thomistic secondary causation. The Broad Church tradition minimizes dogmatic specificity entirely. Critics charge Anglican ambiguity with incoherence or evasion. Anglicans respond that mystery appropriately characterizes divine-human interaction, and that liturgical formation shapes proper understanding better than systematic theology. Contemporary applications include ecumenical dialogue where Anglican comprehensiveness facilitates conversation across traditions, and bioethics discussions balancing divine sovereignty, natural processes, and human agency. Compared to Reformed precision and Catholic systematization, Anglicanism prioritizes pastoral wisdom and liturgical practice over metaphysical clarity, maintaining productive tension through via media.

*** 1.4.5 Methodist Response

Methodist theology affirms synergistic causation where divine prevenient grace universally restores human capacity to cooperate with salvation, making conversion the result of grace-enabled human response rather than irresistible divine action. John Wesley developed this position through his lifelong engagement with Scripture and experience, particularly articulated in "Predestination Calmly Considered" (1752) and sermon "On Working Out Our Own Salvation" (1785). Wesley's Arminianism, refined through debates with Calvinist George Whitefield, emphasized universal atonement and resistible grace while maintaining salvation's foundation in divine initiative. The Methodist Articles of Religion (1784), abridged from Anglican articles, removed strict predestinarian language while retaining human depravity and grace's necessity.

Theological foundations rest on Wesley's doctrine of prevenient grace—grace preceding conscious faith that partially restores free will damaged by original sin. This universal divine initiative, grounded in Christ's atonement for all humanity, enables but doesn't compel positive response to subsequent convincing and converting grace. Wesley argued in "On Working Out Our Own Salvation" that Philippians 2:12-13 teaches "God worketh in you; therefore you can work; otherwise it would be impossible." Divine enabling makes human response possible without determining it.

Two core arguments support Methodist causation. First, the universal love argument: God's character as revealed in 1 Timothy 2:4 ("desires all people to be saved") and 2 Peter 3:9 ("not wishing that any should perish") demonstrates that salvation's possibility extends universally, requiring genuine human choice rather than predetermined selection. Irresistible grace contradicts divine love's respect for human freedom. Second, the responsibility argument: meaningful moral accountability requires libertarian freedom. Wesley argued that if God unilaterally determines salvation and damnation, "truth, and mercy, and justice" are "destroyed" (Predestination Calmly Considered).

Scripture supports cooperative causation: Revelation 3:20 portrays Christ knocking while humans open, and Matthew 23:37 shows Jesus willing to gather Jerusalem though they "were not willing." Acts 7:51 warns against resisting the Holy Spirit, implying resistance's possibility. Wesley's translation of Romans 9 emphasized corporate rather than individual election.

Internal variations include debates over entire sanctification's causation—whether instantaneous or gradual—and whether prevenient grace merely enables or partially restores human nature. Holiness movements emphasized divine action in sanctification; Wesleyan Arminians stressed cooperative processes. Some contemporary Methodists approach open theism, questioning divine foreknowledge. Critics charge that any human contribution compromises grace or makes salvation uncertain. Methodists respond that grace-enabled response doesn't merit salvation but accepts freely offered mercy, and that assurance comes from present relationship with Christ rather than eternal decree. Contemporary applications include addiction recovery models balancing divine empowerment and human responsibility, and social justice theology emphasizing human agency in cooperating with divine redemptive purposes. Compared to Reformed monergism and Catholic semi-Augustinian grace, Methodism maximizes human participation within grace-enabled framework, grounding salvation security in relational fidelity rather than eternal decree.

*** 1.4.6 Baptist Response

Baptist theology generally affirms libertarian causation regarding human will while maintaining God's meticulous sovereignty over redemptive history, though significant diversity exists across Calvinist and Arminian streams united by biblicism and soul competency. This tension emerged in Baptist origins, with General Baptists (1609) following Arminian causation and Particular Baptists (1644) adopting Reformed theology. The First London Confession (1644) and Second London Confession (1689) reflected Calvinist causation among Particular Baptists, while General Baptist Thomas Helwys emphasized human freedom. The Baptist Faith and Message (2000) represents contemporary Southern Baptist consensus, affirming divine election while emphasizing human responsibility and decision.

Theological foundations prioritize individual biblical interpretation over systematic tradition, creating causation diversity. The principle of soul competency—each believer's direct accountability before God—implies libertarian capacity to respond to the Gospel. Simultaneously, many Baptists affirm comprehensive divine sovereignty over salvation. This tension remains unresolved institutionally, with local church autonomy permitting varied positions within Baptist identity defined more by ecclesiology (believer's baptism, congregational governance) than causation metaphysics.

Two primary arguments appear across Baptist causation discussions. First, the conversion argument: authentic faith requires genuine human decision, not divine compulsion, grounding believer's baptism practice in conscious, voluntary commitment. E.Y. Mullins in *The Axioms of Religion* (1908) emphasized competent personal response to Christ. Second, the biblical authority argument: Scripture presents both divine sovereignty (Ephesians 1:4-5) and human responsibility (Joshua 24:15), which must be affirmed without rationalistic harmonization subordinating either to philosophical systems. Baptist theologian A.H. Strong in *Systematic Theology* (1907) attempted mediating position acknowledging mystery.

Scripture interpretation varies by stream: Calvinist Baptists emphasize Romans 9:15-16 and Ephesians 2:8-9 on sovereign election and gracious salvation, while Arminian Baptists stress John 3:16, Revelation 22:17, and Acts 17:30 on universal invitation and human response. Both affirm Acts 2:38-39 linking repentance, baptism, and promise.

Internal variations span from Primitive Baptists affirming hyper-Calvinism to Free Will Baptists embracing Arminian synergism. Reformed Baptists follow 1689 Confession's compatibilism, while moderate Baptists often hold inconsistent positions prioritizing evangelistic urgency over metaphysical precision. Progressive Baptists increasingly explore open theism. Critics note theological incoherence in affirming both libertarian freedom and meticulous sovereignty. Baptists respond that biblical fidelity transcends philosophical consistency, and that evangelistic practice requires emphasizing human decision regardless of underlying metaphysics. Contemporary applications include debates over altar calls and decisional regeneration, with Reformed Baptists critiquing manipulation while revivalist Baptists emphasize responsive faith. Compared to systematically consistent Reformed or Arminian traditions, Baptist diversity reflects prioritizing biblical authority and local autonomy over unified causation metaphysics, creating denomination-wide theological breadth united by ecclesiological distinctives rather than causation consensus.

*** 1.4.7 Pentecostal Response

Pentecostal theology affirms dynamic, relational causation where the Holy Spirit's immediate, personal activity initiates divine action while believers cooperatively respond through faith and obedience, emphasizing experiential encounter over systematic metaphysics. This pneumatocentric approach emerged from Azusa Street Revival (1906-1909) under William J. Seymour's leadership, drawing on Holiness movement theology and Charles Parham's earlier Topeka revival (1901). Early Pentecostals prioritized Spirit baptism, evidenced by tongues and empowerment for witness, over causation metaphysics. The Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths (1916) established doctrinal parameters emphasizing salvation's availability to all who believe and the Spirit's active role in Christian life.

Theological foundations rest on pneumatology rather than predestinarian debates. The Holy Spirit operates as immediate, personal agent whose presence and power believers experience directly through tongues, prophecy, healing, and miracles. This experiential immediacy shapes causation understanding: divine action is relational and responsive rather than predetermined or mechanical. Donald Gee's *Concerning Spiritual Gifts* (1928) emphasized the Spirit's sovereign distribution of charismata, while believers cultivate receptivity and obedience. Contemporary Pentecostal theologian Amos Yong develops pneumatological ontology where Spirit's activity pervades creation and redemption.

Two core arguments characterize Pentecostal causation. First, the empowerment argument: Acts 1:8 promises Spirit-empowered witness, demonstrating that divine causation equips and enables human agency rather than replacing it. The Spirit fills believers (Ephesians 5:18) who actively cooperate through yielding and obedience. Second, the immediacy argument: Joel 2:28-32, fulfilled at Pentecost (Acts 2), demonstrates the Spirit's unmediated activity across social boundaries, making divine causation experientially accessible rather than theoretically obscure. Signs and wonders provide tangible evidence of divine agency.

Scripture emphasizes Spirit's personal activity: John 16:13 presents the Spirit guiding believers, implying relational interaction rather than mechanical determination. 1 Corinthians 12:11 teaches the Spirit "distributes to each one individually as he wills," affirming divine sovereignty in spiritual gifts. Romans 8:26-27 portrays the Spirit interceding through believers' prayers, demonstrating cooperative causation.

Internal variations include Oneness Pentecostals' modalistic theology affecting causation metaphysics, and debates over whether tongues necessarily evidences Spirit baptism. Classical Pentecostals emphasize initial evidence, while Charismatic movements prioritize ongoing manifestations. Some Pentecostals lean Reformed, others Arminian, but experiential emphasis typically overshadows systematic precision. Critics charge that prioritizing experience over doctrine risks subjectivism and emotional manipulation. Pentecostals respond that authentic spiritual experience confirmed by Scripture provides more certain knowledge than abstract metaphysics, and that the early church's pneumatic vitality preceded systematic theology. Contemporary applications include healing ministries attributing recovery to divine intervention requiring human faith, and prophetic practices discerning Spirit's guidance through impressions and utterances. Compared to cessationist traditions limiting divine causation to providence and Catholic sacramental mediation, Pentecostalism emphasizes immediate, experiential pneumatic causation accessible to all Spirit-filled believers, prioritizing encounter over explanation and dynamic relationship over predetermined decree.

*** 1.4.8 Seventh-day Adventist Response

Seventh-day Adventist theology affirms libertarian causation grounded in the Great Controversy theodicy, where God limits divine power to preserve genuine human freedom, making the cosmic conflict between good and evil dependent on creaturely choices with eternal consequences. This framework emerged through Ellen G. White's visions and writings (1844-1915), particularly *The Great Controversy* (1858, revised 1888), which presents cosmic history as spiritual warfare requiring free-will participation. White's theodicy synthesized Arminian free-will theology with apocalyptic urgency, emphasizing investigative judgment where human choices determine eternal destinies. The 28 Fundamental Beliefs (revised 2015) affirm that God created humanity with "freedom to think and to do" while maintaining divine sovereignty over cosmic outcomes.

Theological foundations rest on the Great Controversy metanarrative where Satan's rebellion challenged divine government's justice, requiring God to vindicate His character through allowing evil's consequences to manifest. This cosmic trial necessitates libertarian freedom, since predetermined actions couldn't demonstrate divine justice. White argued that God "could have destroyed Satan and his sympathizers" but divine wisdom required allowing evil's full development to permanently resolve questions about God's character. This makes causation libertarian by divine self-limitation rather than metaphysical necessity.

Two core arguments support Adventist causation. First, the vindication argument: God's character is on trial before the universe, requiring genuine creaturely freedom to demonstrate that divine government produces willing loyalty rather than coerced obedience. Predetermined actions couldn't vindicate divine justice. Second, the judgment argument: investigative judgment preceding Christ's return (Daniel 8:14; Hebrews 9:23-28) requires examining human choices to determine salvation, implying libertarian freedom makes eternal difference. Fundamental Belief #24 describes judgment revealing "who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first resurrection."

Scripture interpretation emphasizes free choice: Deuteronomy 30:19 ("I have set before you life and death...choose life"), Joshua 24:15 ("choose this day whom you will serve"), and Revelation 22:17 ("let the one who desires take the water of life freely") demonstrate genuine alternatives requiring libertarian capacity. Ezekiel 18:20 grounds individual responsibility in personal choice.

Internal variations include debates over conditional immortality's implications for causation (annihilation versus eternal torment) and whether investigative judgment implies works-righteousness. Some Adventists emphasize assurance in Christ, others stress obedience to divine law. Progressive Adventists question White's prophetic authority, affecting causation frameworks. Critics charge that investigative judgment undermines justification by faith and reintroduces works-based salvation. Adventists respond that judgment examines faith's genuineness demonstrated through obedience, not merits salvation, and that assurance comes from present relationship with Christ examined in judgment. Contemporary applications include health reform emphasizing human choices' consequences, and Sabbath observance as covenant choice demonstrating allegiance. Compared to Reformed determinism and Wesleyan prevenient grace, Adventism maximizes libertarian freedom through cosmic trial theodicy, making human choices cosmically significant in vindicating divine character before universal observation, grounding salvation security in ongoing faithful choices rather than eternal decree or sacramental participation.

*** 1.4.9 Jehovah's Witnesses Response

Jehovah's Witnesses affirm selective causation where Jehovah exercises sovereign foreknowledge and control selectively rather than exhaustively, choosing to foreknow only what He determines to control while granting creatures libertarian freedom in most circumstances. This distinctive position emerged through Watch Tower Society's development under Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916), who rejected predestination and eternal torment, and Joseph Rutherford (1869-1942), who systematized theocratic organization. The *New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures* (1961, revised 2013) reflects this theology, and *Insight on the Scriptures* (1988) provides comprehensive treatment, arguing that Jehovah's "exercise of foreknowledge is selective and discretionary" rather than comprehensive and deterministic.

Theological foundations distinguish between foreknowledge (ability to know future) and foreordination (causally determining future). Witnesses teach that Jehovah possesses unlimited capacity for foreknowledge but selectively exercises it, foreknowing and foreordaining only what serves His purposes while permitting genuine freedom elsewhere. This preserves both divine sovereignty over redemptive history and creaturely libertarian agency. The theodicy requires that Satan's challenge to Jehovah's sovereignty necessitated proving creatures would loyally serve God freely, requiring genuine choice uncoerced by divine predetermination.

Two core arguments support this position. First, the character argument: Jehovah's justice requires that he not predetermine actions He subsequently judges. *Insight* argues that if God predestined all actions, "it would be inconsistent for him to give man a book of laws, commandments, and exhortations...and then judge man's compliance or noncompliance with such." Divine character necessitates libertarian framework for meaningful judgment. Second, the sovereignty vindication argument: Satan challenged Jehovah's right to rule, claiming creatures serve God only from selfish motives. Proving Satan wrong requires allowing genuine freedom to demonstrate willing loyalty rather than programmed obedience.

Scripture interpretation emphasizes selective foreknowledge: Acts 2:23 shows Jesus "delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God," demonstrating specific foreordination. Romans 8:29-30 describes those God "foreknew," implying selective rather than comprehensive foreknowledge. Deuteronomy 30:19 presents genuine choice, while Jeremiah 7:31 states regarding child sacrifice that God "had not commanded it nor had it come up into my heart," suggesting Jehovah hadn't foreknown these actions.

Internal variations are minimal due to organizational unity enforced through centralized teaching authority. However, historical shifts occurred, including 1951 doctrinal clarification distinguishing foreknowledge from foreordination more sharply. Dissident groups like Bible Students maintain Russell's earlier positions. Critics charge that selective foreknowledge creates arbitrary distinctions and limits divine omniscience. Witnesses respond that omniscience includes knowing what one chooses not to know, and that refusing to exercise foreknowledge demonstrates respect for freedom rather than limitation. Contemporary applications include ethical decision-making where individuals bear full responsibility for choices, and evangelistic urgency where human decisions determine salvation since God hasn't predetermined outcomes. Compared to Reformed comprehensive foreordination and open theism's genuine ignorance of future free choices, Jehovah's Witnesses' selective foreknowledge attempts middle position maximizing both divine sovereignty over purposes and human libertarian freedom in response, grounded in theodicy requiring freedom's genuineness to vindicate Jehovah's sovereignty.

*** 1.4.10 Latter-day Saints (Mormon) Response

Latter-day Saint theology affirms eternal, libertarian causation where intelligences possess uncreated agency that even God cannot override, making divine causation persuasive and organizational rather than creative or determinative. This radical metaphysics emerged through Joseph Smith's revelations (1820-1844), particularly the King Follett discourse (1844) teaching that God and humans share eternal nature as intelligences, and Doctrine and Covenants section 93 revealing that "intelligence...was not created or made, neither indeed can be." Smith's later theology, developed through experiences with Book of Abraham and temple theology, presents finite God organizing eternal matter and intelligences rather than creating ex nihilo. This process theology influenced later articulation by B.H. Roberts, James Talmage (*Articles of Faith*, 1899), and contemporary LDS scholars like Blake Ostler.

Theological foundations rest on metaphysical naturalism where "spirit is matter" (D&C 131:7) and reality consists of eternal, uncreated elements including intelligences. God's causation operates through superior knowledge, persuasion, and organizational power rather than ontological difference from creatures. D&C 93:29-30 declares "Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be." This implies inherent agency preceding divine action. God organized intelligences into spirits, provided bodies through procreation, and offers exaltation through ordinances, but cannot override essential freedom.

Two core arguments characterize LDS causation. First, the agency argument: eternal, inherent agency grounds moral responsibility and makes progression toward godhood meaningful. If God determined actions, neither judgment nor progression would be just or possible. 2 Nephi 2:11-16 teaches that opposition, choice, and agency are eternal principles necessary for existence itself. Second, the theodicy argument: God is not responsible for evil because He didn't create matter or intelligences from nothing but organized pre-existing elements. Evil results from misuse of eternal agency, not divine causation. God's work is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39) through persuasion and provision, not coercion.

Scripture emphasizes libertarian choice: 2 Nephi 2:27 declares humans "are free to choose liberty and eternal life...or to choose captivity and death." Alma 42:27 affirms "man should be judged according to his works." D&C 58:26-28 emphasizes human initiative: "it is not meet that I should command in all things."

Internal variations include debates over divine foreknowledge's extent (whether exhaustive or probabilistic) and whether God's progression continues eternally. Some LDS scholars approach open theism, others affirm comprehensive foreknowledge through eternal perspective. Folk beliefs sometimes emphasize predestination of elect spirits, contradicting official theology. Critics charge that limited God cannot guarantee salvation or govern cosmos. LDS respond that God's knowledge and power remain supreme even if not absolutely infinite, and that persuasive rather than coercive power reflects higher ethics. Contemporary applications include emphasis on personal revelation and individual responsibility in decision-making, and genealogical work enabling choices beyond mortality through proxy ordinances. Compared to traditional Christian creatio ex nihilo and comprehensive divine sovereignty, LDS theology presents radically libertarian causation grounded in eternal natures and inherent agency, making divine-human relationship collaborative progression toward shared divine potential rather than ontological gulf between Creator and creature, positioning God as organizer and exemplar rather than absolute First Cause.

*** 1.4.11 Christian Science Response

Christian Science denies material causation entirely, teaching that divine Mind constitutes sole reality and cause while material causes represent mortal error requiring correction through spiritual understanding. Mary Baker Eddy developed this radical idealism through spiritual experiences culminating in 1866 healing following injury, systematized in *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures* (1875, revised through 1910). Eddy's metaphysics rejects material causation as illusion, teaching that "the only realities are the divine Mind and idea" (*Science and Health* 331:18-19). This absolute idealism draws from philosophical idealism, Transcendentalism, and Eddy's biblical interpretation, establishing causation exclusively in Mind.

Theological foundations rest on seven synonyms for God: Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love. Each denotes aspects of divine causation producing all genuine reality. Material appearances including disease, sin, and death result from "mortal mind"—misperception of reality rather than actual causation. *Science and Health* declares "there is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation" (468:9-11). This makes divine Mind the sole cause, and spiritual understanding the means of aligning perception with reality's truth.

Two core arguments support this metaphysics. First, the omnipotence argument: if God is All-in-all and entirely good, evil and matter cannot truly exist, since their existence would limit divine omnipotence or goodness. Therefore, material causation including disease represents error requiring correction rather than reality requiring acceptance. Second, the demonstration argument: Jesus's healings demonstrated spiritual law overriding material conditions, proving Mind's causative supremacy over matter. Eddy emphasized replicating Christ's demonstrations through spiritual understanding, not faith in material remedies.

Scripture interpretation emphasizes spiritual reality: Genesis 1's spiritual creation precedes Genesis 2's material account, indicating primacy of spiritual causation. John 4:24 declares "God is Spirit," and 1 John 3:9 states "No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him," indicating spiritual causation prevents sin. Acts 17:28 affirms "in him we live and move and have our being," suggesting Mind as sole cause of existence.

Internal variations are minimal due to centralized authority through Mother Church, though independent Christian Science practitioners interpret Eddy variably. Some practitioners emphasize healing pragmatically while avoiding metaphysical depths; others pursue strict metaphysical consistency. Post-Eddy, no authoritative interpreter exists, creating interpretive diversity masked by institutional unity. Critics charge that denying material causation ignores obvious physical reality and causes harm when refusing medical treatment. Christian Scientists respond that spiritual understanding reveals reality's true nature, and that countless healings demonstrate Mind's supremacy over matter. Contemporary applications include healing practice relying exclusively on prayer and spiritual understanding, refusing medical intervention, and addressing social issues as errors requiring spiritual correction rather than material reform. Compared to traditional Christian providence working through secondary causes and process theology's persuasive divine influence on material processes, Christian Science eliminates material causation entirely, making spiritual understanding the sole means of aligning with divine Mind's causative reality. This absolute idealism positions Christian Science uniquely within Christian traditions, rejecting not merely materialism's sufficiency but matter's existence, making divine Mind all-causative and material appearances illusory errors requiring spiritual correction through understanding.

*** 1.4.12 Unity Church Response

Unity theology affirms mental causation where thoughts and beliefs shape experience through spiritual laws governing manifestation, while divine presence within each person empowers positive causation through aligned consciousness. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore founded Unity (1889) through experiences of spiritual healing and study of New Thought metaphysics, Christian mysticism, and Transcendentalism. Charles Fillmore's *Christian Healing* (1909) and *The Twelve Powers of Man* (1930) systematized Unity's metaphysical causation, teaching that "thoughts held in mind produce after their kind." Unity Magazine (founded 1889) disseminated practical applications, emphasizing affirmative prayer (affirmations) and denial to align consciousness with divine truth.

Theological foundations rest on divine immanence: the Christ consciousness or divine spark within each person constitutes true identity, possessing creative power through thought and word. Fillmore taught that "mind is the seat of perception of the things that appear in the physical universe" and that changing mental patterns changes material circumstances. This metaphysical causation operates through spiritual law analogous to natural law—reliable, impersonal principles governing manifestation. Prayer works by aligning consciousness with divine Truth rather than petitioning external deity, activating indwelling creative power.

Two core arguments characterize Unity causation. First, the consciousness argument: since God is omnipresent good, suffering results from misperception and negative thought patterns rather than external causes. Changing consciousness through affirmative prayer and denial aligns experience with divine reality. Myrtle Fillmore's healing from tuberculosis through affirming divine life demonstrated consciousness's causative power. Second, the practical demonstration argument: countless testimonies of healing, prosperity, and transformed relationships validate mental causation's effectiveness. Unity emphasizes empirical results over theological speculation.

Scripture interpretation emphasizes creative power of thought and word: Genesis 1 shows God creating through speech, modeling mental causation. Proverbs 23:7 "as he thinks in his heart, so is he" (KJV) demonstrates thought's causative power. Mark 11:24 "whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours" teaches faith's manifestation power. John 1:1-3 presents the Word (Logos) as creative principle, suggesting thoughts and words manifest reality.

Internal variations include debates over prosperity theology's appropriateness (some emphasize spiritual prosperity over material) and whether Unity constitutes Christian denomination or broader spiritual movement. Earlier Unity emphasized Christian framework; contemporary Unity includes non-Christian spiritual seekers. Some Unity teachers approach Christian Science's absolute idealism; others maintain material reality's existence while emphasizing mind's influence. Critics charge that blaming victims for negative experiences through causative thought demonstrates insensitivity and ignores systemic injustice. Unity responds that understanding mental causation empowers rather than blames, and that social transformation requires individual consciousness change. Contemporary applications include prosperity consciousness teachings where financial lack results from poverty mentality requiring affirmative prayer, healing ministries attributing wellness to aligned thinking, and positive psychology approaches emphasizing thought patterns' transformative power. Compared to traditional Christian providence through external divine agency and materialist causation through physical processes alone, Unity's mental causation positions consciousness as creative power activating divine law, making spiritual practice pragmatic methodology for improved circumstances rather than petitioning distant deity. This New Thought metaphysics emphasizes human creative partnership with divine presence through mental and spiritual disciplines, democratizing causative power through accessible consciousness techniques.

*** 1.4.13 Eastern Orthodox Response

Eastern Orthodox theology affirms synergistic causation through theosis where divine energies enable creaturely participation in divine life while essence remains transcendent, preserving both God's absolute causative priority and genuine human freedom through ontological transformation. This framework emerged through Patristic consensus, particularly Athanasius's soteriological formula "God became man that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*, c.318), and Gregory Palamas's essence-energies distinction systematized against Barlaam in *Triads* (1338-1341). The seventh Ecumenical Council (787) on iconography affirmed material participation in divine energies, extending causation understanding to physical reality. *The Philokalia* compiled ascetical texts demonstrating practical synergistic transformation through hesychastic prayer.

Theological foundations rest on the essence-energies distinction: God's unknowable essence transcends all causation categories while divine energies—God's uncreated activities ad extra—enable genuine participation in divine life. This resolves Western debates over primary-secondary causation by proposing that human cooperation with divine energies doesn't diminish God's sovereignty since energies are fully divine yet really distinct from essence. Palamas taught that Moses encountered energies (divine light) not essence on Sinai, establishing precedent for transformative participation without pantheistic absorption.

Two core arguments structure Orthodox causation. First, the theosis argument: salvation as deification requires genuine human participation in divine life, impossible through either monergistic determination or autonomous human action. The energies enable synergistic cooperation transforming human nature without violating freedom. 2 Peter 1:4 teaches believers "become partakers of the divine nature," requiring real participation beyond legal imputation. Second, the ascetical argument: spiritual practices (prayer, fasting, sacraments) effect ontological transformation rather than merely behavioral modification, demonstrating causative cooperation between grace and human effort. The Jesus Prayer cultivates receptivity to divine energies transforming the practitioner.

Scripture emphasizes cooperative causation: Philippians 2:12-13 balances human working with divine enablement. John 15:4-5 uses vine-branches imagery showing mutual indwelling requiring both divine life and creaturely reception. Matthew 6:6 and Luke 11:9-10 present prayer as real communication effecting divine response rather than predetermined outcomes.

Internal variations exist between monasticism emphasizing ascetical rigor and parish theology emphasizing sacramental grace, though both affirm synergy. Russian theology sometimes emphasizes sobornost (communal unity) affecting causation understanding socially. Palamite theology remains normative but receives varying emphasis across Orthodox jurisdictions. Critics charge that essence-energies distinction creates incoherent division in divine simplicity, and that synergism compromises grace. Orthodox respond that the distinction preserves biblical tension between transcendence and immanence, and that energies enable genuine cooperation without meriting grace. Contemporary applications include hesychastic prayer revival demonstrating practical causation through spiritual practices, iconography as energies' material mediation, and ecological theology emphasizing creation's potential participation in divine energies through human priesthood. Compared to Western legal frameworks (Protestant imputation, Catholic merit), Orthodox causation emphasizes ontological transformation through real participation in divine energies, making salvation transformative process requiring sustained cooperation rather than forensic declaration or completed transaction. This positions human agency as receptive participation in divine life energizing transformation toward deification, maintaining both divine initiative's absoluteness and human response's genuine significance through essence-energies framework enabling non-competitive divine-human causation.

*** 1.4.14 Oriental Orthodox Response

Oriental Orthodox theology affirms unified causation through Cyril of Alexandria's "mia physis" (one nature) Christology, where divine and human causation unite without confusion or separation in Christ's single incarnate nature, modeling synergistic cooperation preserving each causative source's integrity while achieving unified action. This framework crystallized at Ephesus (431) affirming Cyril's Christology against Nestorius, and resisted Chalcedon (451) as implying Nestorian division, maintaining "one incarnate nature of God the Word" in Alexandrian tradition. Severus of Antioch (465-538) developed miaphysite theology distinguishing it from Eutychian monophysitism, teaching real humanity and divinity unite in Christ's person without mixture or division. This Christological framework shapes causation understanding across theology.

Theological foundations apply Christological hypostatic union to divine-human cooperation: as Christ's divinity and humanity operate in single unified action, so divine grace and human will cooperate inseparably in salvation. Severus taught that Christ's will remained both divine and human yet operated unitedly, rejecting dyothelitism (two wills) as Nestorian. This Christological causation model extends analogically to Christian life: believers united to Christ participate in unified divine-human causation through incorporation into His incarnate reality. Coptic theologian Matta El Meskeen (Matthew the Poor, 1919-2006) developed contemporary spirituality emphasizing union with Christ enabling synergistic cooperation.

Two core arguments characterize Oriental Orthodox causation. First, the hypostatic union argument: if Christ's natures united in single personal activity, divine-human cooperation in salvation analogously unites grace and human response inseparably. Dividing these suggests Nestorian error separating what God joined. Cyril's "hypostatic union" demonstrates unified causation without confusion, providing model for all divine-human interaction. Second, the deification argument: salvation as theosis requires real participation in divine nature impossible through extrinsic divine action alone or autonomous human effort. Athanasius taught "He became human that we might become divine," requiring unified causation transforming human nature through union with divinity.

Scripture emphasizes unified action: John 10:30 "I and the Father are one" demonstrates unified divine-human causation in Christ. Galatians 2:20 "it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" shows unified action in believers through mystical union. Philippians 2:12-13 presents divine and human working as single cooperative reality rather than competing causes.

Internal variations exist between Coptic, Ethiopian, Syrian, Armenian, and Eritrean Orthodox churches, with Ethiopian theology incorporating unique local elements and Armenian theology engaging distinctive philosophical traditions. However, miaphysite Christology and its causation implications remain broadly consistent. Monastic traditions emphasize ascetical cooperation while parish theology emphasizes sacramental grace. Critics charge that miaphysitism collapses into Eutychianism, confusing natures and undermining humanity's integrity in causation. Oriental Orthodox respond that "mia physis" affirms real distinction within union, preserving both divine and human causative integrity through hypostatic union rather than mechanical conjunction. Contemporary applications include liturgical theology where divine and human worship unite in Christ's offering, ascetical practices enabling transformative synergy, and ecumenical dialogue exploring common ground with Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions on synergistic causation. Compared to Nestorian emphasis on causative distinction and Chalcedonian two-natures framework, Oriental Orthodox mia-physis theology emphasizes unified operation of divine and human causation modeled on Christ's single incarnate nature, making Christology directly determinative for causation understanding. This positions synergistic cooperation as mystical union in Christ's incarnate reality rather than coordination between distinct agents, grounding causation in participatory Christological ontology where believers' union with Christ enables unified divine-human action transforming toward deification.

*** 1.4.15 Assyrian Church of the East Response

Assyrian Church of the East theology affirms dyophysite causation where Christ's divine and human natures maintain complete distinction in their operations while united in single person (prosopon), modeling coordination between divine sovereignty and human freedom preserving each causative source's integrity without merger. This framework emerged defending Theodore of Mopsuestia's Antiochene Christology and Nestorius's objection to "Theotokos" (God-bearer) without qualification, formalized at Synod of Beth Lapat (484) and Synod of Mar Aba I (544). Babai the Great's *Book of Union* (seventh century) systematically articulated "two natures, two qnome, one prosopon," distinguishing Church of the East from Chalcedonian "one hypostasis" terminology while affirming similar Christological reality. This precise causative distinction shapes theological anthropology and soteriology.

Theological foundations rest on Theodore's and Nestorius's insistence on preserving each nature's properties: divine nature remains impassible, eternal, and omniscient while human nature experiences growth, suffering, and death. These operate coordinately in Christ's single person without mixing or confusing. Babai taught that "the two natures preserve their natural properties in the union" preventing monophysite confusion. This Christological causation model applies analogically to divine-human cooperation: God's sovereign action and human free agency coordinate without either being absorbed into the other. Divine grace enables human response while respecting libertarian freedom.

Two core arguments characterize Assyrian causation. First, the preservation argument: authentic humanity requires complete human causative properties including libertarian will, limited knowledge, and vulnerability. If Christ's humanity lacked these, incarnation fails and salvation becomes impossible since Christ couldn't genuinely represent humanity or model obedient response to God. Antiochene emphasis on Christ's moral development (Luke 2:52) demonstrates real human agency. Second, the coordination argument: divine sovereignty and human freedom coordinate analogously to Christ's two natures—distinct yet united in personal action. Neither determinism nor libertarianism alone captures reality; coordinated dual causation preserves biblical tensions.

Scripture emphasizes causative coordination: Philippians 2:5-8 presents Christ's self-emptying as genuine human obedience coordinating with divine mission. Hebrews 4:15 affirms Christ "has been tempted as we are, yet without sin," requiring libertarian capacity for moral choice. Matthew 26:39 "not as I will, but as you will" distinguishes human from divine will while coordinating them. Luke 2:40, 52 demonstrates real human growth in wisdom, indicating human causative properties.

Internal variations include historical debates over precise terminology (qnoma versus hypostasis), resolved through affirming similar reality in different vocabulary. Geographic isolation in Persia and later under Islamic rule created theological development independent from Byzantine controversies. Contemporary Assyrian theology emphasizes practical Christian living over scholastic precision, though traditional Christological distinctives remain identity markers. Dialogue with Catholic Church (1994 Common Christological Declaration) acknowledged convergence beneath terminological differences. Critics historically charged Nestorius and Church of East with dividing Christ into two persons, making Mary merely Christotokos (Christ-bearer) not Theotokos. Assyrians respond that prosopon unity preserves single person while qnome distinction prevents nature-confusion, and that Theotokos acceptable when understood as "she who bore the one who is God." Contemporary applications include ethical theology emphasizing genuine human moral agency coordinating with divine grace, prayer as dialogue rather than monologue, and ecumenical contributions showing terminological diversity can mask theological convergence. Compared to miaphysite unified causation and Chalcedonian hypostatic union, Assyrian dyophysite causation maximally distinguishes divine and human operations while maintaining personal unity, providing framework for robust human freedom coordinating with divine sovereignty without reduction to either determinism or autonomous libertarianism, modeling Christian life on Christ's coordinated divine-human causation preserving each nature's complete properties.
