*** 1.5.121 Korean Buddhism Response

Korean Buddhism distinguishes material (saek/색) from immaterial (sim/심) reality through the fundamental unity of form and emptiness (saek-jeuk-si-gong/色即是空), emphasizing that materiality is not separate from but rather manifests buddha-nature. The Seon tradition particularly emphasizes sudden awakening (don-o/頓悟) to this non-dual reality, where material phenomena are expressions of mind's luminous awareness rather than ontologically separate substances.

Historically, Wonhyo (617-686 CE) established the doctrine of "harmonization of disputes" (hwajaeng/和諍), arguing that apparent contradictions between material and immaterial dissolve in ultimate reality. His commentary on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith synthesized Yogacara consciousness-only doctrine with Madhyamaka emptiness teaching. Jinul (1158-1210) developed "sudden awakening, gradual cultivation" (don-o jeom-su/頓悟漸修), teaching that while awakening to mind's immaterial nature is instantaneous, purifying material karmic conditioning requires progressive practice. Seongcheol (1912-1993) controversially advocated "sudden awakening, sudden cultivation," arguing complete realization eliminates material/immaterial distinction entirely.

Key textual foundations include the Korean Tripitaka (Palman Daejanggyeong), particularly the Heart Sutra's proclamation that "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (saek-jeuk-si-gong, gong-jeuk-si-saek), and Jinul's Excerpts from the Dharma Collection. The Platform Sutra's teaching that "originally not one thing exists" (bonrae mu il mul) grounds Korean Seon's understanding of material reality's ultimate emptiness.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material phenomena lack inherent existence (musang/無相), arising through dependent origination; (2) Mind's immaterial luminosity (myeongshim/明心) is the ground of all material manifestations; (3) The material/immaterial distinction reflects deluded consciousness, dissolved through cultivating "no-thought" (munyeom/無念).

Internal variations appear between Jogye Order's emphasis on Seon meditation versus Taego Order's integration of ritual practices engaging material forms. Some lineages stress gradual purification of material karma, while others advocate complete transcendence.

Critics question whether material suffering can be dismissed as ultimately unreal. Korean Buddhism responds that recognizing emptiness doesn't negate conventional reality but liberates practitioners from reifying material phenomena, enabling compassionate engagement with suffering beings.

Contemporary applications include Buddhist environmental activism recognizing material nature's sacred dimension, and integration of neuroscience exploring consciousness's relationship to material brain processes. Korean Buddhism shares with Japanese Zen the non-dual understanding while maintaining distinctive emphasis on sudden awakening combined with gradual cultivation practice.

*** 1.5.122 Vietnamese Buddhism Response

Vietnamese Buddhism distinguishes material (sắc) from immaterial (tâm) reality through the harmonization of Mahayana philosophical schools, Theravada ethical discipline, and indigenous spirit veneration, teaching that material forms are manifestations of mind while maintaining their conventional significance for practice and devotion. The Thiền tradition emphasizes that enlightenment transcends the material/immaterial dichotomy through direct realization of original mind (bản tâm) while honoring material bodies as vehicles for liberation.

Historically, Vĩnh Nghiêm (d. 1090) established Vietnamese Thiền's distinctive character by synthesizing Chinese Chan meditation with Confucian social ethics and indigenous cosmology. Trúc Lâm founder Trần Nhân Tông (1258-1308), a king who became monk, taught that enlightenment integrates material governance responsibilities with immaterial wisdom, articulating "unity of the three teachings" (tam giáo đồng nguyên). Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926-2022) developed "Engaged Buddhism," teaching that material social transformation and immaterial spiritual practice are inseparable through "interbeing" (tiếp hiện).

Key textual foundations include the Lotus Sutra's teaching of skillful means employing material forms to convey immaterial truth, the Avatamsaka Sutra's vision of interpenetration (mutual containment of all phenomena), and Trần Nhân Tông's Essential Compilation on Entering Chan (Khóa Hư Lục). The Platform Sutra grounds understanding that material and immaterial arise together in consciousness.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material reality possesses "true thusness" (chân như/真如) making it non-separate from immaterial buddha-nature; (2) Mindfulness practice reveals material phenomena's impermanent, interdependent nature dissolving reification; (3) Material engagement (family, society, environment) provides essential context for immaterial liberation rather than obstacle to overcome.

Internal variations exist between monastic communities emphasizing meditation retreat versus Engaged Buddhism's material social activism. Some practitioners stress Pure Land devotion employing material images, while Thiền practitioners emphasize imageless meditation.

Critics question whether harmonizing diverse perspectives creates conceptual confusion. Vietnamese Buddhism responds that lived practice integrates apparent contradictions, as Trần Nhân Tông demonstrated by unifying royal governance with monastic simplicity.

Contemporary applications include mindfulness-based stress reduction treating material illness through immaterial awareness, environmental protection recognizing nature's sacred dimension, and refugee assistance integrating material aid with spiritual support. Vietnamese Buddhism shares with Chinese Buddhism the harmonization approach while distinctively emphasizing engaged social practice rooted in interbeing philosophy.

*** 1.5.123 Chinese Buddhism Response

Chinese Buddhism distinguishes material (sè/色) from immaterial (xīn/心) reality through synthetic frameworks integrating Indian Buddhist philosophy with indigenous Chinese cosmology, teaching that material qi-energy and immaterial consciousness interpenetrate through the doctrine of "principle and phenomena are non-obstructed" (lǐshì wú'ài/理事無礙). The Huayan and Tiantai schools particularly emphasize that material forms manifest immaterial buddha-nature through infinite interdependent origination.

Historically, Zhiyi (538-597) systematized Tiantai philosophy teaching "three thousand realms in a single thought-moment" (yī niàn sān qiān/一念三千), where material reality's entirety exists within immaterial mind while maintaining conventional distinction. Fazang (643-712) developed Huayan metaphysics of "mutual containment and interpenetration" (xiāng jí xiāng rù/相即相入), arguing that each material particle contains the entire immaterial dharma-realm. Zongmi (780-841) synthesized Chan and Huayan, teaching that original enlightenment (běnjué/本覺) is immaterial nature manifesting through material phenomena.

Key textual foundations include the Lotus Sutra's teaching that all material existence reveals immaterial buddha-nature, the Avatamsaka Sutra's vision of Indra's net where each jewel reflects all others, and the Awakening of Mahayana Faith's distinction between immutable immaterial "suchness" (zhēnrú/真如) and conditioned material "birth-and-death" (shēngsǐ/生死). The Platform Sutra grounds Chan understanding that "originally nothing exists" yet conventional material reality functions.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material phenomena lack inherent existence (wúzìxìng/無自性), arising through dependent origination from immaterial consciousness; (2) The "one mind" (yīxīn/一心) encompasses both immaterial absolute and material conventional dimensions; (3) Material practice employing body, speech, and mind purifies obstructions revealing immaterial original enlightenment.

Internal variations appear between Huayan's philosophical systematization versus Chan's practical meditation, and between Pure Land's devotional engagement with material images versus Chan's imageless contemplation. Debates continue regarding sudden versus gradual approaches.

Critics question whether synthesis creates conceptual incoherence. Chinese Buddhism responds that multiple expedient means (fāngbiàn/方便) address different capacities, with all paths converging in non-dual realization.

Contemporary applications include integration with quantum physics exploring consciousness's role in material reality, environmental ethics recognizing nature's sacred dimension, and medical practices combining material treatment with immaterial qi-cultivation. Chinese Buddhism shares with Korean and Vietnamese traditions the synthetic approach while maintaining distinctive emphasis on systematic philosophical frameworks harmonizing principle and phenomena.

*** 1.5.124 Japanese Zen Response

Japanese Zen distinguishes material (shiki/色) from immaterial (shin/心) reality through the radical non-dualism of "form is emptiness, emptiness is form," teaching that material phenomena are not expressions of immaterial mind but rather the direct manifestation of buddha-nature itself, with no underlying substance beyond immediate appearance. Dōgen's teaching that "practice-realization is naturally undefiled" (shushō-ichinyo) emphasizes that material sitting (zazen) is not means to immaterial goal but realization itself.

Historically, Eisai (1141-1215) introduced Rinzai Zen emphasizing kōan practice breaking conceptual distinctions between material and immaterial through paradoxical investigation. Dōgen (1200-1253) established Sōtō Zen teaching "just sitting" (shikantaza), arguing in Shōbōgenzō that material existence (u/有) and immaterial emptiness (mu/無) are non-dual aspects of "being-time" (uji/有時). Hakuin (1686-1768) revitalized Rinzai through systematic kōan curriculum investigating questions like "What is the sound of one hand?" transcending material/immaterial categories.

Key textual foundations include Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō, particularly "Genjōkōan" teaching that firewood doesn't "become" ash (challenging linear material causation) and "Uji" revealing material existence's temporal nature. The Platform Sutra grounds understanding that awakening transcends gradual accumulation. The Heart Sutra's "form is emptiness" is chanted daily in Zen monasteries.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material phenomena are "thus-come" (nyorai/如来), requiring no immaterial essence beyond appearing; (2) Zazen's material practice embodies immaterial enlightenment without gap (hongaku/本覚); (3) Everyday material activities—eating, working, defecating—manifest awakening when performed with total presence (gyōjū-zaiga/行住坐臥).

Internal variations appear between Rinzai's kōan-introspection and Sōtō's silent illumination, and between traditional monastic austerity versus lay practice integration. Some teachers emphasize sudden realization while others stress gradual deepening.

Critics question whether denying material/immaterial distinction enables ethical relativism. Zen responds that non-dual realization heightens rather than diminishes moral sensitivity to material suffering.

Contemporary applications include Zen-inspired minimalism in material design, mindfulness practices addressing material stress through immaterial awareness, and environmental activism rooted in recognizing nature's sacred thisness. Japanese Zen shares with Korean Seon the meditation emphasis while distinctively stressing material practice's immediacy over metaphysical frameworks distinguishing consciousness from phenomena.

*** 1.5.125 Korean Seon Response

Korean Seon distinguishes material (saek/색) from immaterial (sim/심) reality through the teaching that original mind (bonshim/본심) is neither material nor immaterial but the luminous awareness (yeongji/靈知) underlying both, accessed through investigating critical phrase (hwadu/話頭) that short-circuits conceptual discrimination. The tradition emphasizes that while material and immaterial appear distinct in deluded consciousness, awakening reveals their fundamental identity in mind-nature (simseong/心性).

Historically, Jinul (1158-1210) systematized Korean Seon by integrating sudden awakening to immaterial mind-nature with gradual cultivation purifying material karmic habits, teaching in Secrets on Cultivating the Mind that original enlightenment (bongak/本覺) precedes material/immaterial distinction. Taego Bou (1301-1382) emphasized hwadu investigation of "What is this?" (igeo-si mueosinga/이것이 무엇인가) transcending categories. Gyeongheo (1849-1912) revitalized Seon practice teaching that material suffering intensifies spiritual urgency (분심/bunsim) catalyzing breakthrough.

Key textual foundations include the Platform Sutra teaching "originally nothing exists," the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment revealing mind's luminous nature, and Jinul's Encouragement to Practice emphasizing "tracing back the radiance" (hoegwang banjo/回光返照) to immaterial source. The Heart Sutra's identity of form and emptiness grounds practice.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material phenomena arise from immaterial mind yet mind transcends material/immaterial dichotomy in original purity; (2) Hwadu investigation employs material doubt-sensation to penetrate immaterial great doubt (daeuisim/大疑心); (3) Sudden awakening reveals material reality's emptiness while gradual cultivation integrates realization through material ethical conduct and compassion.

Internal variations exist between Jogye Order's mainstream hwadu practice versus Taego Order's integration of mantra recitation, and between those emphasizing sudden complete enlightenment versus gradual deepening post-awakening. Debates continue regarding Seongcheol's controversial "sudden cultivation" teaching.

Critics question whether emphasizing immaterial mind devalues material embodiment. Korean Seon responds that awakening to mind-nature enhances rather than diminishes engagement with material suffering through bodhisattva compassion.

Contemporary applications include temple-stay programs offering material respite through immaterial meditation, social engagement addressing material inequality through spiritual transformation, and dialogue with neuroscience exploring consciousness's relationship to material brain. Korean Seon shares with Japanese Zen the meditation emphasis while distinctively maintaining systematic hwadu practice and gradual cultivation framework following sudden awakening.

*** 1.5.126 Vietnamese Thien Response

Vietnamese Thiền distinguishes material (sắc) from immaterial (tâm) reality through the "three-in-one" synthesis (tam nhất/三一) harmonizing Buddhist meditation, Confucian material ethics, and Taoist natural cosmology, teaching that enlightenment integrates immaterial wisdom with material social responsibility rather than transcending worldly engagement. The tradition emphasizes that material phenomena and immaterial mind interpenetrate through "interbeing" (tiếp hiện), where nothing exists independently.

Historically, Trần Nhân Tông (1258-1308) established Trúc Lâm ("Bamboo Grove") tradition teaching that kingship's material governance and monastic immaterial practice are non-dual expressions of awakening, articulated in Thiền Tông Chỉ Nam ("Pointing to the Source of the Thiền School"). Liễu Quán (1670-1742) systematized Vietnamese Thiền emphasizing gradual cultivation through material precept-observance alongside sudden insight. Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926-2022) developed Engaged Buddhism teaching that material social transformation and immaterial meditation are inseparable, with mindfulness revealing all phenomena's interdependent "interbeing."

Key textual foundations include the Lotus Sutra teaching skillful use of material means for immaterial liberation, the Avatamsaka Sutra's vision of mutual interpenetration, and Trần Nhân Tông's Essential Directives emphasizing "mind-ground" (tâm địa) as source of material manifestation. The Platform Sutra grounds understanding of original purity beyond material defilement.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material and immaterial co-arise through dependent origination (duyên khởi/緣起), neither prior nor independent; (2) Mindfulness practice reveals material phenomena's impermanent, selfless nature as gateway to immaterial liberation; (3) Compassionate material engagement with suffering beings actualizes immaterial bodhisattva path rather than obstructs it.

Internal variations exist between forest monasteries emphasizing meditation retreat versus urban centers practicing engaged social activism, and between those stressing sudden insight versus gradual ethical cultivation. Some lineages emphasize Pure Land devotion employing material images.

Critics question whether harmonizing diverse elements creates superficial syncretism. Vietnamese Thiền responds that lived practice naturally integrates dimensions separated only by conceptual analysis, as Trần Nhân Tông embodied.

Contemporary applications include mindfulness-based interventions addressing material health through immaterial awareness, environmental protection recognizing nature's interbeing, and conflict transformation integrating material peacebuilding with spiritual practice. Vietnamese Thiền shares with Chinese Buddhism the synthetic approach while distinctively emphasizing engaged social practice and interbeing philosophy transcending material/immaterial dualism through radical interdependence.

*** 1.5.127 Shugendo Response

Shugendō distinguishes material (shiki/色) from immaterial (shin/心) reality through the teaching that sacred mountains are not merely material locations but living manifestations of immaterial cosmic buddhas and kami, with ascetic practice (shugyō/修行) in material nature enabling direct realization of immaterial enlightenment embodied as supernatural power (genriki/験力). The tradition emphasizes that material body and immaterial spirit are unified through yamabushi ("mountain warrior-ascetic") practices transforming practitioners into living buddha-kami.

Historically, En no Gyōja (634-706), legendary founder, reportedly achieved supernatural powers through mountain austerities, establishing precedent for material nature as immaterial training ground. Shōbō (832-909) systematized Shugendō by integrating esoteric Buddhism's material-immaterial non-dualism with Shinto's kami veneration, teaching that mountain pilgrimage symbolizes spiritual journey through ten realms of existence. Tendai monk Jien (1155-1225) theorized that material mountains manifest immaterial buddha-nature through Lotus Sutra teaching that "mountains, rivers, grasses, trees all attain buddhahood."

Key textual foundations include the Shugendō shōsō ("Shugendō Essentials") describing mountain training, the Lotus Sutra establishing material nature's sacred dimension, and esoteric Buddhist texts teaching that material mantras and mudras manifest immaterial enlightenment. The doctrine of hongaku ("original enlightenment") grounds belief that material existence already embodies immaterial buddhahood.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material mountains are mandala manifestations of immaterial cosmic truth, with specific peaks corresponding to buddha-realms; (2) Severe material austerities—waterfall standing, cliff-hanging, fire-walking—purify body-mind revealing immaterial supernatural capacities; (3) Material ritual implements and immaterial visualization practices non-dually actualize enlightenment through "three mysteries" (sanmitsu/三密) of body, speech, mind.

Internal variations exist between Tendai-affiliated and Shingon-affiliated Shugendō, between mountain hermits and village-based practitioners, and regarding degree of Shinto versus Buddhist emphasis. Some stress material healing powers while others emphasize immaterial enlightenment.

Critics question whether pursuing supernatural powers contradicts Buddhist detachment. Shugendō responds that powers serve compassionate healing while mountain practice itself embodies enlightenment beyond power-seeking.

Contemporary applications include environmental conservation recognizing mountains' sacred status, adventure spirituality integrating material challenge with immaterial growth, and alternative healing employing material herbs with immaterial energy work. Shugendō shares with esoteric Buddhism the ritual emphasis while distinctively locating practice in material nature as immaterial training ground, unifying Buddhist and Shinto dimensions.

*** 1.5.128 Tenrikyo Response

Tenrikyō distinguishes material (busshitsu/物質) from immaterial (seishin/精神) reality through the teaching that God the Parent (Oyagami/親神) created material universe through ten immaterial aspects (jūzai no riyō/十全の理用) operating as divine providence, with material human body metaphorized as "thing lent" (kashimono/借り物) while immaterial mind alone belongs to human as "thing borrowed" (karimono/借り物). The tradition emphasizes that spiritual cultivation transforms material suffering into immaterial joy (yōki/陽気) through realizing divine parental love.

Historically, foundress Nakayama Miki (1798-1887) received revelations from 1838 claiming Oyagami possession, teaching in Ofudesaki ("Tip of the Writing Brush") that material illness and poverty result from immaterial "mental dust" (kokoro no hokori/心の埃) accumulated through selfishness. She established Jiba, material location where humanity originated and immaterial Parent-God resides. Her successor Iburi Īzō (1833-1907) systematized theology emphasizing material world as temporary training ground for immaterial spiritual growth toward "Joyous Life."

Key textual foundations include Ofudesaki's 17 volumes revealing material creation's purpose, Mikagura-uta ("Sacred Songs") describing ten immaterial aspects creating material forms, and Osashizu ("Divine Directions") guiding material conduct. The doctrine teaches Oyagami employed immaterial providence (ten aspects: moon-sun, water, fire, wind, etc.) to create material world for human joy.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material body is divine gift enabling immaterial soul's spiritual maturation through embodied experience; (2) Material suffering traces to immaterial mental dust obscuring awareness of Oyagami's parental love; (3) Sweeping away mental dust through material service and immaterial gratitude transforms life into joyous paradise on earth.

Internal variations exist between emphasizing physical healing versus spiritual transformation, between material mission work versus immaterial contemplation, and regarding interpretation of metaphorical teachings about body-mind relationship. Some stress literal material healing while others emphasize symbolic meaning.

Critics question whether "mental dust" teaching blames victims for material suffering. Tenrikyō responds that identifying causation empowers spiritual transformation rather than condemns, while Oyagami's parental compassion embraces all.

Contemporary applications include medical facilities integrating material treatment with immaterial spiritual care, disaster relief expressing material compassion grounded in immaterial gratitude, and interfaith dialogue emphasizing universal divine parenthood. Tenrikyō shares with other Japanese new religions the this-worldly emphasis while distinctively teaching material reality as temporary divine loan for immaterial spiritual development.

*** 1.5.129 Konkokyo Response

Konkōkyō distinguishes material (busshitsu/物質) from immaterial (seishin/精神) reality through the teaching that Tenchi Kane no Kami (Golden Spirit of Heaven and Earth) mediates between immaterial divine realm and material human world through "mutual reliance" (aitatagai/相互賴), where divine and human, spiritual and physical, interdependently support existence. The tradition emphasizes that material difficulties are not punishments but opportunities for immaterial spiritual growth through "mediation" (toritsugi/取次) revealing divine compassion.

Historically, founder Kawate Bunjirō (1814-1883), renamed Konko Daijin, received revelations from 1859 teaching that previous understanding of kami as punishing material transgressions misunderstood immaterial divine nature as unconditionally compassionate parent. He established toritsugi mediation practice where ministers relay between material human concerns and immaterial divine guidance. His teachings compiled in Konko Daijin Oboegaki ("Sacred Memoirs") emphasize material blessings flow from immaterial faith and gratitude.

Key textual foundations include Tenchi Kakitsuke ("Reminder from the Parent God of the Universe") revealing divine nature, Konkō Daijin Oboegaki recording foundational teachings, and Gorikai ("Divine Teachings") explaining material-immaterial relationship through mutual reliance. The teaching "the divine depends on humanity; humanity depends on the divine" grounds understanding.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material universe manifests immaterial Kami's creative activity (kakutoku/覺得), with humans as partners in ongoing creation; (2) Material suffering results not from divine punishment but from misunderstanding immaterial spiritual principles of harmonious living; (3) Mediation practice connects material needs with immaterial divine providence, transforming circumstances through spiritual realization.

Internal variations exist between churches emphasizing formal toritsugi sessions versus integrating mediation into daily life, between stress on material this-worldly benefits versus immaterial character development, and regarding interpretation of divine-human mutual reliance. Some emphasize direct divine encounter while others stress ministerial mediation.

Critics question whether mutual reliance diminishes divine transcendence. Konkōkyō responds that divine condescension to rely on humanity manifests supreme compassion rather than weakness, enabling authentic relationship transcending material-immaterial divide.

Contemporary applications include counseling services addressing material problems through immaterial spiritual guidance, interfaith dialogue emphasizing compassionate divine nature, and ecological practice recognizing material nature as immaterial divine manifestation. Konkōkyō shares with Tenrikyō the this-worldly emphasis while distinctively teaching mutual reliance between material and immaterial realms through mediation practice bridging divine and human.

*** 1.5.130 Oomoto Response

Ōmoto distinguishes material (busshitsu/物質) from immaterial (reisei/霊性) reality through the teaching that divine creator Kami (primarily Ushitora no Konjin) governs cosmos through spiritual laws manifesting in material realm, with shamanic revelation and artistic creation bridging immaterial spiritual and material physical dimensions toward establishing earthly paradise (chijouten/地上天). The tradition emphasizes that material world reconstruction (tatekai/立替) requires immaterial spiritual reformation (tatenaoshi/立直) through divine revelation.

Historically, foundress Deguchi Nao (1836-1918), illiterate peasant woman, received possession-revelations from 1892 recorded in Ofudesaki, proclaiming immaterial divine plan to reconstruct material world corrupted by materialism and nationalism. Co-founder Deguchi Onisaburō (1871-1948) systematized theology in Reikai Monogatari ("Tales of the Spiritual World"), describing immaterial spirit realm's (yūkai/幽界) relationship to material realm through elaborate cosmology integrating Shinto, Buddhism, and new revelations.

Key textual foundations include Nao's Ofudesaki revealing divine plan for material-immaterial transformation, Onisaburō's 81-volume Reikai Monogatari mapping spiritual dimensions, and doctrine of "art as religion, religion as art" (geijutsu soku shūkyō/藝術即宗教) bridging material and immaterial. The teaching that "spirit precedes matter" (rei saki butsu go/霊先物後) establishes immaterial primacy.

The tradition advances three core arguments: (1) Material reality results from immaterial spiritual causation, with kami governing through divine laws (shinri/神理); (2) Immaterial spiritual purification through chinkon kishin (calming spirit, returning to kami) practices enables material world transformation; (3) Artistic material creation—calligraphy, pottery, poetry—expresses immaterial divine inspiration, manifesting spiritual truth physically.

Internal variations exist between emphasizing apocalyptic material reconstruction versus gradual spiritual reformation, between shamanic revelation versus artistic expression, and regarding Onisaburō's elaborate spirit-realm cosmology. Political persecution (1921, 1935) created internal debates about material political engagement.

Critics question whether spirit-matter hierarchy devalues physical existence. Ōmoto responds that recognizing spiritual primacy enhances material world's significance as divine creation requiring human co-creative participation.

Contemporary applications include interfaith peace initiatives recognizing spiritual unity underlying material religious diversity, ecological activism protecting material nature as divine creation, and Esperanto promotion unifying material humanity through universal language. Ōmoto shares with other new religions the this-worldly transformation emphasis while distinctively integrating shamanic revelation, artistic creation, and elaborate spiritual cosmology bridging immaterial and material dimensions.
