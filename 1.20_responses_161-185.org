*** 1.20.161 Shi'a Islam Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the divine reality (haqiqa) as manifested through the divinely appointed Imamate, which serves as the living connection between temporal particulars and eternal truths. Each created particular reflects the divine names and attributes while participating in the cosmic order established through wilayah (spiritual authority), where the Imams function as the intermediary realm between divine transcendence and worldly manifestation. The relationship operates through a hierarchy of being wherein individual existents derive their reality from the universal principle of tawhid, while the Imam represents the perfect instantiation of this universal in temporal form.

The doctrine of batin (inner meaning) and zahir (outer form) provides the metaphysical framework for understanding this relationship. Individual things possess an outer, apparent form accessible to ordinary perception, while simultaneously participating in an inner, spiritual reality that connects them to universal divine principles. The Imams, as repositories of both exoteric knowledge (ilm al-zahir) and esoteric wisdom (ilm al-batin), guide believers in recognizing how particular things and events manifest universal spiritual truths. This understanding requires ta'wil (spiritual interpretation) that penetrates beyond surface appearances to discern the universal principles operating within particular manifestations.

Furthermore, the concept of hujjat Allah (proof of God) establishes that universal divine principles must necessarily manifest in particular, accessible forms. Individual things relate to universals not as mere abstract instantiations but as necessary expressions of divine wisdom that makes the transcendent knowable. The Imam serves as the supreme particular that fully embodies the universal principle of divine guidance, demonstrating how individual realities can perfectly reflect universal truths. This relationship involves both descent (tanazzul) of universal principles into particular forms and ascent (mi'raj) of particular consciousness toward universal understanding through spiritual purification and devotion to the divinely appointed guides.

*** 1.20.162 Ismaili Islam Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through a sophisticated hierarchical cosmology of emanation (fayd) and manifestation (tajalli), where particular existents participate in degrees of reality descending from the divine Intellect through progressively more particularized levels of being. The Universal Intellect (al-'Aql al-Kulli) represents the first emanation from divine unity, containing all universal principles in their archetypal form. Individual things in the sensible world relate to these universals through intermediate levels of Soul (Nafs), Nature (Tabi'a), and the angelic hierarchies, each particular thing receiving its form and reality from the level appropriate to its station in existence.

The doctrine of ta'wil (esoteric interpretation) reveals how apparent particulars encode universal spiritual meanings. Every individual thing, event, or scriptural passage possesses both an exoteric (zahir) dimension of particular manifestation and an esoteric (batin) dimension of universal truth. The Imam, as the living embodiment of Universal Intellect in human form, guides seekers in recognizing these connections. Through proper understanding, one perceives how individual ritual practices manifest universal spiritual principles, how particular prophets embody universal aspects of divine guidance, and how specific historical events reflect eternal cosmic patterns. This recognition transforms one's relationship to particulars from mere literal acceptance to spiritual comprehension.

The concept of hudud (cosmic limits or ranks) further clarifies this relationship by establishing a precise ontological ladder connecting divine unity to worldly multiplicity. Individual things occupy specific ranks in this hierarchy, each relating to universal principles according to its degree of proximity to the divine source. The Imam as natiq (speaking prophet) and the da'i (summoner) as intermediaries maintain the connection between levels, ensuring that universal truths continuously flow into particular manifestations. Spiritual advancement involves ascending this ladder through recognition (ma'rifa), progressing from engagement with particulars toward direct apprehension of the universal principles they instantiate, ultimately achieving union with Universal Intellect.

*** 1.20.163 Twelver Shi'ism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the mediating role of the Fourteen Infallibles (Prophet Muhammad, Fatima, and the Twelve Imams), who represent the perfect instantiation of universal divine attributes in particular human form. This relationship operates through the metaphysical doctrine of wilayat takwiniyyah (existential authority), wherein the Imams function as the intermediate realm through which divine universal principles manifest in the particular world. Each individual existent derives its reality from the divine names and attributes, but this derivation necessarily passes through the spiritual station of the Ahl al-Bayt, who serve as the cosmic axis connecting transcendent universals to immanent particulars.

The theological framework of lutf (divine grace) establishes that universal divine principles must manifest in accessible particular forms for guidance to be effective. The Imams represent this necessary particularization—they are the "speaking Quran" (Quran al-natiq) while the written Quran is the "silent Imam." Individual things relate to universal principles through this same dynamic: the particular instantiates and makes knowable the universal while remaining ontologically dependent upon it. The doctrine of bada' (divine alteration) further demonstrates how universal divine knowledge encompasses all particulars while allowing for apparent change in specific manifestations, revealing the complex relationship between eternal principles and temporal particulars.

Philosophically, figures like Mulla Sadra developed sophisticated accounts of this relationship through the concept of substantial motion (al-haraka al-jawhariyya), wherein individual substances continuously develop toward fuller actualization of universal principles. The relationship between particular and universal is not static but dynamic—individual things are constantly in the process of becoming more perfect reflections of the universal archetypes subsisting in divine knowledge. The Imam, as the Perfect Human (al-Insan al-Kamil), represents the complete actualization of all universal human potentials in particular form, serving as both the exemplar of this relationship and the spiritual means by which others can progress. Through devotion to the Imams and adherence to their guidance, believers align their particular existence with universal divine principles.

*** 1.20.164 Zaidi Shi'ism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through rational comprehension and ethical actualization rather than through mystical participation, distinguishing Zaidi thought through its emphasis on rationalist theology (kalam) and activist ethics. Universal principles exist primarily as divine commands and rational precepts accessible through human intellect ('aql), which God has equipped with the capacity to recognize justice ('adl) and its requirements. Individual things and actions relate to these universal moral and ontological principles through the mediating role of reason, which discerns the essential rightness or wrongness of particular acts by reference to universal standards of justice and wisdom.

The Zaidi doctrine of the Imamate provides the political and spiritual framework for this relationship. The Imam must be a descendant of the Prophet through Fatima and Ali, but unlike Twelver Shi'ism, the Imamate is not transmitted through divinely predetermined designation (nass) but through meeting objective universal criteria: knowledge ('ilm), courage (shaja'a), generosity (sakha), and justice ('adl). Individual candidates relate to the universal principle of legitimate authority through their actual possession of these qualities and their active uprising (khuruj) to establish justice. This demonstrates how particulars (individual Imams) must actively embody and implement universal principles rather than passively receiving them through mystical inheritance.

Zaidi theology, influenced by Mu'tazilite rationalism, holds that individual created things relate to divine universal attributes through God's just creation of a rationally ordered cosmos. Each particular existent possesses attributes and capacities appropriate to its nature, and these particulars relate to universal divine wisdom through their orderly arrangement and purposeful design. Human beings occupy a special position: individual persons relate to universal moral principles through their God-given capacity for rational judgment and free choice. The particular human act gains its moral character by conforming to or violating universal principles of justice, which reason can identify independently of revelation, though revelation confirms and clarifies these rational truths. This rationalist framework maintains divine transcendence while empowering human reason to bridge particular and universal.

*** 1.20.165 Alawi Islam Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through a sophisticated doctrine of divine manifestation (tajalli) and spiritual ascent (mi'raj) rooted in esoteric interpretation of Islamic revelation combined with pre-Islamic gnostic traditions. The relationship operates through a complex understanding of divine unity that transcends simple monotheism: particular manifestations in the material world reflect progressive degrees of divine self-disclosure, with each individual thing representing a specific level of the universal divine reality revealing itself. The doctrine of Ali, Muhammad, and Salman as a divine triad (though not compromising tawhid) represents how universal divine attributes manifest in particular sacred persons who embody cosmic principles.

The theological framework centers on cycles of divine manifestation wherein universal spiritual realities repeatedly take particular form throughout history. The Ma'na (divine Meaning or Reality) manifests through the Ism (Name) which appears in concrete Bab (Gate or door). Individual historical figures and events relate to universal cosmic principles by serving as particular instantiations of these eternal archetypal relationships. This understanding requires initiation into esoteric knowledge ('ilm al-batin) that reveals how apparent particulars encode universal spiritual truths. The distinction between initiated believers ('uqqal) and uninitiated followers (juhhal) reflects different capacities for recognizing universal principles operating within particular manifestations.

The complex cosmology involves emanationist hierarchy similar to Neoplatonic and Ismaili thought, where individual things in the material realm relate to universal divine attributes through intermediate spiritual levels. The doctrine of tanasukh (transmigration) further complicates the relationship by suggesting that individual souls progress through multiple particular embodiments toward fuller realization of universal spiritual principles. Ritual practices, particularly the communal liturgical gathering, serve as particular occasions for encountering and participating in universal divine reality. The esoteric interpretation (ta'wil) of Quranic verses reveals how specific narratives and commandments symbolize universal spiritual truths, with particular observances functioning as veils that both conceal and reveal the universal principles accessible only to the spiritually advanced. This layered approach honors both particular and universal while maintaining their essential hierarchical relationship.

*** 1.20.166 Sunni Islam Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the comprehensive framework of tawhid (divine unity), which establishes that all particular existents derive their being, attributes, and actions from the one universal divine reality. Each created thing manifests specific divine names and attributes (asma wa sifat) while remaining absolutely distinct from divine essence, creating a relationship wherein particulars simultaneously reflect and depend upon universal divine principles without compromising transcendence. The Quran establishes this relationship: "To Allah belong the most beautiful names, so invoke Him by them" (7:180), indicating how multiplicity of particular manifestations relates to unity of divine attributes.

The theological concept of divine decree (qadar) and determination (taqdir) explains how individual things relate to universal divine knowledge and will. Every particular existent, event, and quality was known eternally in divine knowledge as universal principle before manifesting as temporal particular. The Ash'ari formula that God creates both the universal capacity (qudra) and the particular act reconciles divine sovereignty with human particularity. Individual things possess no independent existence or efficacy but relate to universal divine power as the sole truly active principle. However, this does not collapse particulars into mere illusion—each created thing maintains its particular reality as an expression of divine creative wisdom (hikma) that willed multiplicity to manifest divine perfection.

The practice of recognizing divine signs (ayat) in creation develops the proper relationship to this particular-universal dynamic. Contemplating individual created things—from the particular arrangement of celestial bodies to the specific design of the bee—reveals universal divine wisdom, power, and mercy. The hadith tradition emphasizes reflection (tafakkur) on creation as worship, indicating that engaging particulars properly means perceiving the universal divine attributes they manifest. Scholars like Al-Ghazali elaborate how individual things serve as "veils and bridges" to divine reality—veils if one mistakes them for independent realities, bridges if one recognizes them as manifestations of universal divine creative activity. This requires spiritual purification (tazkiyah) whereby the heart becomes capable of seeing universal divine reality operating within particular manifestations while maintaining proper understanding of both transcendence (tanzih) and immanence (tashbih).

*** 1.20.167 Hanafi School Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the jurisprudential methodology of qiyas (analogical reasoning), which identifies the effective cause ('illa) linking particular cases to universal legal principles derived from revelation. When faced with a new particular case lacking explicit textual ruling, the jurist identifies the underlying universal principle by analyzing the ratio legis of similar cases in Quran and Sunnah. Individual particulars relate to universal legal maxims (qawa'id kulliyya) through shared effective causes, demonstrating how Hanafi methodology bridges particular and universal through rational analysis of divine legislative wisdom.

The theological foundation, following Maturidi principles, establishes that individual created things relate to universal divine attributes through God's creative wisdom and just ordering of existence. Each particular thing manifests aspects of divine wisdom, power, and knowledge while maintaining absolute ontological dependence on divine creative act. The Hanafi-Maturidi framework emphasizes human rational capacity ('aql) to recognize universal moral and ontological principles even in particular instances not explicitly addressed by revelation. Individual acts gain their legal-moral character by conforming to or violating universal principles of benefit (maslaha) and harm (mafsada) that divine law protects.

The concept of 'urf (customary practice) demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how universal divine principles relate to particular cultural contexts. Universal Shari'a objectives (maqasid) of protecting religion, life, intellect, lineage, and property manifest through particular legal rulings that may vary according to time, place, and circumstance. Individual legal determinations relate to universal principles through jurists' interpretation (ijtihad) that considers both textual sources and rational analysis. Abu Hanifa's famous dictum emphasizing reason alongside revelation reflects this balance: particular cases are judged by applying universal principles through reasoned methodology that recognizes both divine transcendent law and particular contextual realities. The distinction between immutable universal principles and adaptable particular applications allows Hanafi jurisprudence to maintain fidelity to revelation while addressing unprecedented particular cases through principled reasoning.

*** 1.20.168 Maliki School Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the authoritative practice ('amal) of the Medinan community, which provides the particular historical instantiation of universal Islamic principles as lived by those closest to the Prophet's teaching. This distinguishes Maliki methodology: rather than abstracting universal principles purely from texts, particular practices of the early Medinan community serve as concrete embodiments of universal Prophetic guidance. Individual contemporary cases relate to universal principles by examining how the Medinan community—as a living particular manifestation of Islamic ideals—addressed similar situations.

The theological framework of maslaha mursala (unrestricted public interest) demonstrates how individual cases relate to universal Shari'a objectives even without specific textual precedent. When faced with novel particulars, the jurist identifies the universal principle of benefit (maslaha) that Shari'a protects—preservation of religion, life, intellect, lineage, and property—and rules accordingly. Individual legal determinations relate to these universal objectives through reasoned assessment of how particular actions serve or undermine these purposes. Imam Malik's emphasis on this principle reflects trust in reason's capacity to bridge particular cases and universal divine purposes.

The concept of sadd al-dhara'i (blocking means to evil) illustrates sophisticated understanding of how individual acts relate to universal moral principles through their consequences and implications. A particular action may be neutral in itself but relate to universal prohibition through its tendency to lead toward harm. Individual cases are thus evaluated not merely by immediate particular characteristics but by their relationship to universal principles through causal chains and probable outcomes. The living tradition of Medinan practice, combined with reasoned interpretation guided by universal Shari'a objectives, creates a dynamic relationship between particular and universal that remains rooted in historical embodiment while adapting to new circumstances. This approach honors both the transcendent universal principles of divine law and the particular wisdom embedded in how the exemplary community lived those principles.

*** 1.20.169 Shafi'i School Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the systematic methodology of usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence) that Imam al-Shafi'i codified, establishing a rigorous framework for deriving particular rulings from universal textual sources. The relationship operates through a hierarchical system: universal principles exist in Quran and authentic Sunnah, while individual cases relate to these universals through analogical reasoning (qiyas) that identifies the effective cause ('illa) linking particular instances to established principles. Al-Shafi'i's insistence on explicit textual grounding for legal reasoning ensures that individual determinations maintain clear connection to universal revealed principles rather than floating freely in subjective interpretation.

The theological framework emphasizes divine legislative wisdom wherein universal principles in revelation address human needs across all particular contexts. Individual cases not explicitly mentioned in texts relate to universal principles through the ratio legis (hikma and 'illa) that rational analysis can identify. The Shafi'i methodology requires precise identification of four elements in analogical reasoning: the original case (asl) with established ruling, the new particular case (far'), the effective cause ('illa) present in both, and the ruling (hukm) transferred from universal principle to new particular. This systematic approach ensures individual cases relate to universals through reasoned methodology rather than arbitrary association.

The concept of textual indicators (dalalat al-alfaz) demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how particular words relate to universal meanings. Al-Shafi'i developed detailed analysis of how particular textual expressions indicate universal principles with varying degrees of clarity—from explicit (sarih) to implicit (dalalat al-iqtida') to analogical (qiyas). Individual interpretive judgments must respect these established relationships between particular linguistic forms and universal meanings. Furthermore, the principle that "the particular is judged by the general unless specifically excluded" shows how individual instances naturally fall under universal textual principles unless evidence establishes exception. The Shafi'i balance between fidelity to universal textual sources and reasoned application to particular cases creates a jurisprudence that is both principled and practical, maintaining the authority of revelation while addressing unprecedented particular situations through methodologically rigorous connection to universal principles.

*** 1.20.170 Hanbali School Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through strict adherence to revealed texts (nusus) and rejection of excessive rational speculation that might disconnect particular rulings from universal divine commands. The Hanbali methodology, following Ahmad ibn Hanbal's approach, emphasizes that individual cases relate to universal principles primarily through explicit statements in Quran and Hadith or through the practice (amal) of the Companions who witnessed revelation's particular historical manifestation. This textualist approach maintains that universal divine principles are accessible in their authoritative form only through particular revealed statements and prophetic examples, making human reason supplementary rather than primary in establishing the particular-universal relationship.

The theological framework of Athari creed establishes that individual created things relate to universal divine attributes through God's creative act and sovereign will without speculative rational intermediation. Each particular existent manifests divine creative power and wisdom, but attempting to rationally comprehend how divine universal attributes relate to particular created things risks anthropomorphism (tashbih) or denial (ta'til). The Hanbali position affirms both universal divine attributes and their particular effects "bila kayf" (without asking how), accepting the relationship while refusing to rationally systematize it beyond what revelation states. This preserves divine transcendence while acknowledging real relationship between universal divine reality and particular creation.

The jurisprudential principle of blocking pretexts (sadd al-dhara'i) demonstrates how individual acts relate to universal moral principles through their consequences. A particular action may be technically permissible but forbidden due to its typical relationship to universal prohibitions—individual acts are evaluated by their connection to universal purposes of Shari'a. Furthermore, Hanbali emphasis on hadith compilation reflects conviction that universal principles are best accessed through multiplicity of particular transmitted reports rather than through abstract rational systematization. Ibn Taymiyya's later synthesis maintains this textualist foundation while developing sophisticated rational theology, showing how particular textual reports collectively reveal universal principles about divine attributes, human nature, and ethical requirements. The relationship between particular and universal remains grounded in revelation's authority, with reason serving to understand and apply rather than to independently establish universal principles.

*** 1.20.171 Salafi Islam Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the methodology of returning directly to the authentic sources (Quran and Sunnah) as understood by the righteous predecessors (Salaf al-Salih), bypassing later accretions that obscured this relationship. Universal Islamic principles exist in pure form in revelation and its particular historical instantiation during the Prophet's era and the first three generations. Individual contemporary practices and beliefs relate to these universal principles by conforming strictly to the particular examples and explicit commands found in authenticated sources. Any particular innovation (bid'a) that lacks precedent in these sources, regardless of claimed universal good intentions, represents a corruption of the proper particular-universal relationship.

The theological framework of Salafi 'aqidah emphasizes that individual beliefs about divine attributes must conform exactly to particular revealed descriptions without rational ta'wil (reinterpretation) that claims to access universal meanings beyond textual particular statements. When revelation states that Allah has hands (yadayn), individuals must affirm this particular attribute while denying both anthropomorphic similarity (tashbih) to created hands and rationalist negation (ta'til) in favor of abstract universal meanings. This maintains proper relationship between particular human understanding and universal divine reality: we affirm what revelation particularly states while acknowledging our incapacity to comprehend the universal divine essence.

The concept of tawhid al-asma' wa al-sifat (unity of divine names and attributes) establishes that individual acts of worship relate to universal divine sovereignty exclusively through what God has particularly prescribed. Individual religious practices gain validity only through conformity to particular revealed commands, not through claimed universal spiritual benefits or intentions. The strict methodology of hadith criticism (ilm al-rijal) reflects this concern: individual particular reports must be rigorously authenticated before being accepted as conveying universal religious principles. Modern Salafi scholars emphasize that understanding how individual contemporary situations relate to universal Islamic principles requires direct reference to authenticated texts and Salaf understanding rather than through later jurisprudential methodologies that introduced rational intermediation. This creates a particular-universal relationship that privileges textual particularity as the sole reliable access to universal divine principles, treating the original Islamic community's particular practices as the normative universal standard.

*** 1.20.172 Ash'ari Theology Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through divine creative will (irada) and power (qudra), which continuously sustains all particular existents in accordance with eternal divine knowledge ('ilm). The Ash'ari metaphysical framework, developed by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari and refined by later theologians like al-Baqillani and al-Ghazali, establishes that individual created things possess no inherent power or causal efficacy. Rather, particular events relate to universal divine will through occasionalism: what appears as causal connection between particular things is actually God's customary ('ada) creation of particular effects following particular occasions. Universal divine power is the sole genuine cause, with individual things serving as occasions (not true causes) for divine creative activity.

The relationship between individual human acts and universal divine attributes presents the crucial test of this framework. The Ash'ari doctrine of kasb (acquisition) establishes that particular human actions relate to universal divine creative power through a special modality: God creates both the universal capacity (qudra) and the particular act, while the human "acquires" (yaksib) the act in a manner that preserves moral responsibility without compromising divine sovereignty. Individual choices thus relate to universal divine will and knowledge without collapsing into pure determinism—the universal divine creative act particularizes itself in a way that makes the particular genuinely attributable to the created agent for purposes of moral evaluation and divine justice.

The theological method demonstrates sophisticated understanding of particular-universal relationships. Individual revealed attributes (sifat) relate to universal divine essence (dhat) as eternal attributes subsisting in the essence "not He nor other than He" (la huwa wa la ghayruhu). Particular divine names and actions (af'al) relate to these universal essential attributes through necessary implications: individual creative acts manifest the universal attribute of power, particular instances of mercy manifest the universal attribute of being merciful. The Ash'ari rejection of Mu'tazilite rationalism regarding these relationships emphasizes that human reason cannot independently determine how particular created realities relate to universal divine attributes—this relationship is known through revelation rather than rational speculation. The universal principles of divine justice, wisdom, and mercy operate according to God's will rather than according to necessary rational principles accessible to human particularity.

*** 1.20.173 Maturidi Theology Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through a framework that grants greater epistemic role to human reason ('aql) in recognizing universal truths while maintaining that particular created things depend entirely on universal divine creative activity. The Maturidi school, founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi in Samarkand and dominant in Hanafi theological circles, establishes that individual rational agents can recognize certain universal moral and ontological principles through reason alone, though revelation provides authoritative clarification and additional particular guidance. This creates a more optimistic account of how particular human intellection relates to universal truths compared to stricter Ash'ari occasionalism.

The metaphysical framework regarding causation differs subtly but significantly from Ash'ari atomism. While affirming ultimate dependence of all particulars on universal divine power, Maturidi theology allows for genuine causal properties in created things—individual created causes genuinely relate to particular effects through real (though divinely created and sustained) causal powers. Fire truly burns through its God-given nature, making the relationship between particular fire and particular combustion a real causal connection within the broader framework of universal divine creative sustenance. This preserves both divine sovereignty and the integrity of particular created natures, showing how individual things can possess real attributes and capacities that relate them to other particulars while ultimately depending on universal divine will.

The epistemological framework establishes multiple pathways by which particular human knowledge relates to universal truths. Individual rational reflection (nazar) can yield certain knowledge of universal principles like the existence of God and basic moral truths—the particular human intellect genuinely accesses universal truths through its God-given rational capacity. However, particular revealed texts provide additional universal truths inaccessible to unaided reason, and they authoritatively confirm and clarify the universal principles reason can recognize. The relationship between particular scriptural statements and universal meanings requires careful interpretive methodology: when particular revealed descriptions contradict certain rational knowledge (like anthropomorphic divine attributes), ta'wil (interpretation) discovers the universal meaning intended beyond the particular literal sense. This creates a dynamic interplay where particular human reason and particular revelation together provide access to universal divine truth, with neither particular source completely subordinated to the other.

*** 1.20.174 Mu'tazila Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through divinely created rational order that human intellect ('aql) can genuinely comprehend, establishing that particular created things necessarily manifest universal principles of justice ('adl) and divine wisdom (hikma) accessible to rational investigation. The Mu'tazilite framework, centered on the five principles (usul al-khamsa), maintains that individual events and things relate to universal moral and ontological principles through necessary rational relationships rather than through arbitrary divine will. Particular acts are intrinsically right or wrong according to universal rational principles that even divine will must respect—God cannot make particular tyranny good because it necessarily violates universal justice.

The metaphysical commitment to divine justice requires that individual created things possess real attributes and capacities through which they relate to universal causal principles. Against Ash'ari occasionalism, Mu'tazilite thinkers like al-Nazzam and al-Jubba'i argued that particular created things have genuine causal powers (quwwa) enabling real cause-effect relationships between individual existents. The particular fire genuinely causes particular burning through its God-given nature; individual human choices genuinely cause particular actions through created free will (ikhtiyar). This preserves moral responsibility: individuals relate to universal moral principles through genuine agency rather than through divine determinism. If God creates both good and evil particular acts, divine justice (a universal principle accessible to reason) would be compromised.

The doctrine of human free will (qadar) establishes that individual persons relate to universal moral obligations through genuine capacity for choice. Particular human acts must be genuinely created by individual agents, not by God, to preserve the relationship between moral responsibility and just reward or punishment. The famous Mu'tazilite formula "between two positions" (manzila bayn al-manzilatayn) demonstrates this commitment to rational coherence: individual grave sinners occupy a status between universal categories of belief and unbelief because reason requires such intermediate classification. Furthermore, the principle of rational obligation (al-taklif al-'aqli) establishes that particular humans can know universal moral duties through reason before revelation—individuals relate to universal moral truth through their rational nature, with particular revelation confirming and elaborating what reason can independently recognize. This rationalist framework empowers particular human understanding while maintaining that universal principles of justice and wisdom govern all existence, including divine action.

*** 1.20.175 Ahmadiyya Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the continuous manifestation of divine attributes in creation and the ongoing revelation of divine will through divinely appointed reformers (mujaddids), culminating in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the Promised Messiah and Mahdi. The Ahmadiyya framework maintains that universal Islamic principles of tawhid, prophethood, and divine guidance manifest in particular historical circumstances through figures who embody and clarify these principles for their age. Individual created things participate in universal divine reality by serving as signs (ayat) that rational investigation and spiritual reflection can recognize, demonstrating how particulars point toward universal divine wisdom and power.

The theological distinctive regarding continuation of prophethood establishes a particular relationship between universal divine guidance and individual historical manifestations. While affirming Muhammad as the Seal of Prophets (Khatam al-Nabiyyin), Ahmadiyya interpretation understands this as seal of perfection rather than temporal cessation—universal prophetic truth reached completion in Muhammad, but particular manifestations of this universal continue through subordinate prophethood (nubuwwat dhilliyya). Individual prophetic figures after Muhammad relate to universal Muhammadan light by reflecting and applying his perfect message to particular contexts without bringing new law. This creates dynamic particular-universal relationship where eternal principles manifest through particular guides appropriate to each age's needs.

The emphasis on rational Islam establishes that individual human intellects can and must recognize universal religious truths through reason and evidence rather than blind tradition. Particular religious claims, including Islamic ones, relate to universal truth through their conformity to reason, nature, and human moral intuitions. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's argumentation style demonstrates this: particular scriptural passages, historical events, and rational arguments collectively establish universal truths about divine unity, prophetic authenticity, and spiritual realities. The practice of tabligh (propagation) reflects conviction that universal Islamic truth can be recognized by particular individuals from all backgrounds through rational presentation and spiritual appeal. Individual believers relate to universal community (umma) through voluntary rational conviction rather than through coercion, showing how particular free choice connects to universal divine guidance. The Ahmadiyya emphasis on peaceful propagation and rational discourse reflects understanding that genuine relationship between particular human understanding and universal divine truth requires intellectual conviction and spiritual transformation.

*** 1.20.176 Nation of Islam Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through recognition of the fundamental distinction between the original divine nature of Black people and the created, temporary existence of white people, establishing a metaphysical framework wherein racial particular identity relates to cosmic universal truth. The Nation of Islam theology, as developed by Elijah Muhammad, maintains that individual Black persons participate in the universal divine nature of the Original Man, whose collective existence constitutes the supreme being (Allah). Particular individual identity thus relates to universal divinity through racial membership—each Black individual is part of the collective universal divine reality, while individual white persons represent a particular created deviation from this universal original nature.

The Myth of Yacub provides the narrative framework for understanding how individual historical particulars relate to universal cosmic principles. The particular creation of white people by the scientist Yacub 6,000 years ago manifests the universal principle of divine testing and the particular temporary existence of evil necessary for the righteous to develop strength. Individual white persons and individual institutions of white supremacy relate to this universal principle of temporary deviation from divine order. Conversely, individual Black persons' suffering under white oppression relates to the universal principle of divine testing before the inevitable restoration of Black divine sovereignty. This creates a racial-cosmic particular-universal relationship wherein individual racial identity determines one's relationship to ultimate universal reality.

The emphasis on self-knowledge and moral transformation establishes how individual Nation of Islam members relate to universal principles of divine nature and cosmic order. Each particular person must recognize their true universal identity as divine (if Black) or created (if white), transforming individual consciousness and behavior accordingly. The specific practices—dietary laws, economic self-sufficiency, moral discipline—represent particular individual actions that align with universal principles of divine nature and cosmic restoration. Individual converts (particularly from Christianity) experience radical transformation as they recognize their true relationship to universal divine reality through racial-spiritual awakening. The anticipated apocalyptic restoration, when the Mother Plane destroys white civilization, represents the ultimate reassertion of universal divine order over particular temporary deviation. Individual Nation members prepare for this through particular practices that align their individual lives with this coming universal transformation, demonstrating active relationship between particular choice and universal cosmic destiny.

*** 1.20.177 Reconstructionist Judaism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the organic development of Jewish civilization as an evolving religious civilization rather than through static divine revelation or timeless metaphysical forms. The Reconstructionist framework, founded by Mordecai Kaplan, understands individual Jews and particular Jewish practices as participating in the universal ongoing creativity of Jewish peoplehood, which functions as the primary reality. Individual ritual observances, textual interpretations, and communal institutions relate to universal principles not through supernatural divine command but through their role in sustaining and developing the particular Jewish civilization that embodies universal human values of justice, community, and meaning-making.

The theological reconception of God as the "Power that makes for salvation" or the process of cosmic creativity establishes a naturalistic particular-universal relationship. Individual events and things participate in universal creative processes observable throughout nature and history—there is no supernatural particular intervention but rather natural particular manifestations of universal principles of growth, organization, and value-realization. Individual Jewish beliefs and practices relate to these universal natural principles through their functional role in enabling human flourishing within the particular context of Jewish civilization. The traditional language of divine command and covenant is reinterpreted: individual commandments (mitzvot) relate to universal ethical and communal principles as "folkways" that evolved naturally within Jewish civilization rather than as supernatural particular revelations of universal divine will.

The democratic principle in Reconstructionism establishes that individual Jews relate to universal Jewish values through participatory decision-making rather than through submission to rabbinic or divine authority. Particular communal decisions about practice and belief should reflect the collective wisdom of the community as it interprets universal Jewish values for contemporary circumstances. Individual ritual observance becomes voluntary but encouraged "voting" for Jewish continuity—each particular practice connects the individual to the universal ongoing Jewish civilization. The concept of Judaism as evolving religious civilization means individual Jews simultaneously participate in universal human culture while maintaining particular Jewish distinctiveness. Traditional practices like Sabbath observance relate to universal human needs for rest, reflection, and community while simultaneously expressing particular Jewish cultural identity. This creates dynamic relationship where individual choices either strengthen or weaken the universal Jewish civilization, making each particular person responsible for the collective universal Jewish future.

*** 1.20.178 Humanistic Judaism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through human reason, ethical commitment, and cultural creativity rather than through divine revelation or supernatural metaphysics. The Humanistic Judaism framework, articulated by Sherwin Wine and the International Federation of Secular Humanistic Jews, establishes that individual Jews relate to universal Jewish identity and values through voluntary identification with Jewish history, culture, and ethical principles rather than through belief in divine particular election or supernatural commandments. Particular individual Jewish identity derives from universal human capacities for meaning-making, community formation, and ethical reasoning as exercised within the specific historical and cultural context of Jewish civilization.

The rejection of theistic metaphysics transforms the particular-universal relationship: there are no supernatural universal principles existing independently of human consciousness and culture. Individual values, meanings, and identities relate to universal human experiences and needs through cultural construction and rational reflection. Particular Jewish holidays, rituals, and texts relate to universal human themes—liberation, gratitude, remembrance, hope—while expressing these universals through the particular vocabulary and historical memory of Jewish experience. The celebration of Passover, for instance, connects individual participants to the universal human struggle for freedom through the particular narrative of Jewish liberation, reinterpreted in naturalistic terms as human achievement rather than divine intervention.

The emphasis on human dignity and autonomy establishes that individual persons relate to universal ethical principles through rational judgment and empathetic understanding rather than through divine command. Particular ethical actions gain their moral worth not from conforming to supernatural universal law but from their alignment with universal human wellbeing and dignity as recognized through reason and experience. Individual Jews connect to universal Jewish community through shared history, culture, and commitment to Jewish continuity and flourishing rather than through shared theological beliefs or ritual obligations. This creates a particular-universal relationship centered on human agency: individuals are not passive recipients of universal divine truth but active creators of meaning who choose to express universal human values through the particular cultural forms of Jewish civilization. The relationship between particular and universal becomes thoroughly humanized—universal principles exist only as human constructions, and particular individuals relate to them through conscious choice and cultural participation.

*** 1.20.179 Secular Judaism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through cultural heritage, historical memory, and ethical commitments that maintain Jewish particular identity while rejecting supernatural metaphysical frameworks. The secular Jewish approach, manifested in various movements from socialist Bundism to contemporary cultural Judaism, establishes that individual Jews relate to universal Jewish peoplehood through ethno-cultural identification rather than through religious belief or practice. Particular individual Jewish identity derives from universal human needs for community, meaning, and historical rootedness as expressed through the specific cultural, linguistic, and historical experience of the Jewish people.

The framework often emphasizes this-worldly social justice as the core universal principle to which individual Jews should relate their particular identity. The prophetic tradition, reinterpreted in secular terms, establishes universal ethical obligations toward justice, equality, and human dignity that particular individual actions should instantiate. Individual Jews connect to universal Jewish values not through supernatural revelation but through the particular historical Jewish emphasis on social responsibility, tikkun olam (repairing the world), and solidarity with the oppressed. The Yiddish cultural renaissance, socialist Zionism, and Jewish labor movements represent particular historical instantiations of how universal humanistic and egalitarian principles could be expressed through distinctive Jewish cultural forms.

The relationship between particular Jewish identity and universal human solidarity creates productive tension in secular Jewish thought. Individual Jews simultaneously maintain particular ethnic-cultural distinctiveness while participating in universal human struggles for justice and liberation. The question of Jewish continuity without religious content reflects this particular-universal relationship: how do individual secular Jews transmit universal Jewish values and particular Jewish identity to the next generation without supernatural beliefs? Various approaches emerge—emphasis on Yiddish or Hebrew language, Israeli cultural connection, Holocaust memory, social justice activism—all attempting to bridge particular Jewish identity and universal human values. Individual choices about Jewish education, cultural practice, and communal involvement determine how particular persons relate to the universal ongoing Jewish cultural project. This creates a naturalistic particular-universal relationship where individual human choices and cultural creativity sustain or dissolve the connections between particular persons and universal Jewish civilization.

*** 1.20.180 Post-Holocaust Jewish Thought Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through radical questioning after the Shoah, which shattered many traditional frameworks for understanding how particular suffering relates to universal divine justice, providence, or redemptive purpose. Thinkers like Emil Fackenheim, Richard Rubenstein, and Elie Wiesel confronted how individual Jewish victims' particular experiences of absolute evil challenge universal theological claims about divine goodness, covenant, or historical progress. The relationship between particular and universal becomes problematic: if six million particular murdered individuals cannot be reconciled with universal divine justice or meaningful historical narrative, then perhaps the traditional metaphysical frameworks connecting particular existence to universal purpose have been irreparably damaged.

Fackenheim's "614th commandment" establishes a new particular-universal relationship: individual Jews must survive and maintain Jewish particularity to deny Hitler posthumous victory. This grounds universal Jewish obligation not in traditional divine command or metaphysical principle but in particular historical response to unprecedented evil. Individual Jewish existence and practice gain meaning through relation to this universal post-Holocaust imperative rather than through pre-Holocaust theological frameworks. The State of Israel functions in this framework as particular political instantiation of universal Jewish survival imperative—individual Jews worldwide relate to this particular state through the universal obligation to ensure Jewish continuity after near-annihilation.

Rubenstein's radical theology suggests individual particular existence may relate to no redemptive universal principle whatsoever—the cosmos may be ultimately indifferent or even hostile to human meaning and value. Individual Jews continue particular practices and identity not because they manifest universal divine truth but because cultural-religious forms provide human community and meaning in an absurd universe. Wiesel's narrative approach establishes that individual testimony and memory constitute the primary obligation after the Holocaust—particular stories of suffering and resistance relate to universal Jewish identity not through theological explanation but through witnessing. The relationship between particular Holocaust victims and universal Jewish future becomes one of memory and responsibility: individual contemporary Jews relate to universal Jewish continuity through remembering particular victims and resisting all forms of dehumanization. This post-Holocaust particular-universal relationship privileges historical particularity and ethical response over systematic metaphysical or theological frameworks.

*** 1.20.181 Progressive Judaism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through dynamic interpretation that honors both particular Jewish tradition and universal contemporary moral insights, especially regarding equality, justice, and inclusion. The Progressive Jewish approach, emerging particularly in Reform, Conservative, and Liberal movements, establishes that individual Jews relate to universal Jewish values through critical engagement rather than uncritical acceptance of traditional formulations. Particular inherited practices and beliefs must be evaluated according to universal ethical principles accessible to contemporary moral consciousness, creating a particular-universal relationship that allows for revision of tradition when it conflicts with recognized universal values.

The commitment to gender equality transforms traditional particular-universal relationships: if individual women possess the same moral status and spiritual capacity as men (a universal principle recognized through modern ethical insight), then particular traditional practices limiting women's religious roles must be reformed. Individual women's full participation in ritual leadership, Torah reading, and communal decision-making relates to the universal principle of human dignity and equality, which takes precedence over particular traditional gender restrictions. Similarly, LGBTQ+ inclusion reflects recognition that individual sexual orientation and gender identity relate to universal human dignity in ways that require revision of particular traditional prohibitions. The particular halakhic or textual traditions must be reinterpreted in light of universal ethical principles.

The hermeneutical approach establishes sophisticated particular-universal dynamics. Individual biblical or rabbinic texts contain both timeless universal wisdom and time-bound particular cultural assumptions. Progressive interpretation distinguishes these elements, identifying which particular formulations express universal truths applicable across contexts and which reflect particular ancient circumstances requiring contemporary revision. The universal ethical imperatives of Torah—justice, compassion, dignity—provide the criteria for evaluating particular commandments and traditions. Individual Jews relate to Jewish tradition not through blanket acceptance of all particulars but through critical discernment of which particulars authentically express universal Jewish and human values. This creates an evolutionary particular-universal relationship where individual contemporary Jews participate in the ongoing universal project of Jewish ethical and spiritual development, bringing new insights to bear on particular inherited traditions while maintaining continuity with universal Jewish commitments to justice, learning, and covenant.

*** 1.20.182 Liberal Judaism Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through autonomy of individual conscience informed by tradition rather than through heteronomous submission to particular divine commands or rabbinic authority. The Liberal Jewish framework, particularly in British Liberal Judaism and similar movements, establishes that individual Jews relate to universal Jewish values through rational and ethical judgment that critically evaluates particular traditional practices. Particular commandments gain authority not from supernatural revelation but from their capacity to express universal moral and spiritual truths recognizable to contemporary ethical consciousness. Individual Jews thus relate to Jewish tradition as a resource for universal meaning-making rather than as an external particular authority demanding obedience.

The theological framework emphasizes prophetic universalism: the universal ethical insights of Hebrew prophets—justice for the poor, care for the stranger, peace among nations—constitute the core of authentic Judaism. Particular ritual practices and beliefs should be evaluated according to their relationship to these universal ethical principles. Individual Liberal Jews may choose to observe particular practices like Sabbath, kashrut, or holiday celebrations when these enhance spiritual life, ethical sensitivity, or Jewish identity, but such observance relates to universal human needs for meaning, community, and ethical structure rather than to supernatural particular commands. The relationship between particular practice and universal value becomes functionalist and voluntaristic—individuals adopt particular Jewish forms to the extent they serve universal purposes.

The commitment to social justice establishes how individual Jews should relate to universal ethical obligations. Particular Jewish identity and tradition provide resources and motivation for addressing universal human needs—poverty, oppression, environmental degradation, violence. The prophetic call for justice is understood as universal ethical imperative, with particular Jewish community serving as context for pursuing these universal goals. Individual Liberal Jews often emphasize social action and tikkun olam (repairing the world) as primary expressions of Jewish identity, relating particular Jewish belonging to universal progressive political commitments. This creates a particular-universal relationship that privileges universal ethical engagement over particular ritual or theological conformity, while maintaining that Jewish tradition provides distinctive particular resources—texts, values, community—for pursuing universal justice. The individual conscience, informed by tradition but not bound by it, navigates the relationship between particular Jewish inheritance and universal moral truth.

*** 1.20.183 Contemporary Jewish Renewal Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through mystical practice, embodied spirituality, and eclectic synthesis of Jewish tradition with universal wisdom traditions, creating a neo-Hasidic framework where particular practices serve as vehicles for universal divine encounter. The Jewish Renewal movement, founded by Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and continued by leaders like Arthur Waskow and Shefa Gold, establishes that individual Jews relate to universal divine reality (understood non-dogmatically) through particular Jewish forms reinterpreted for contemporary seekers. Particular prayers, rituals, and meditative practices function as specific technologies for accessing universal spiritual states and divine presence rather than as obligations commanded by an external supernatural authority.

The paradigm of "paradigm shift" recognizes that individual contemporary Jews relate to tradition differently than pre-modern ancestors. The particular move from authority-based religion to experience-based spirituality, from textual fixity to creative interpretation, from patriarchal hierarchy to egalitarian participation represents universal shifts in consciousness that require transformation of particular Jewish forms. Individual spiritual experiences of unity, compassion, and transcendence relate to universal mystical realities that all traditions access through different particular vocabularies. Jewish Renewal draws on Kabbalistic concepts like Ein Sof (infinite divine reality), the sefirot (divine emanations), and tikkun (repair) while reinterpreting these particular Jewish mystical categories as expressions of universal spiritual truths compatible with other traditions' insights.

The practice of davvenology (prayer leading) demonstrates the particular-universal relationship in action. Individual prayer leaders create particular liturgical experiences that honor traditional Jewish forms while incorporating universal elements—meditation techniques from Buddhism, embodied movement, contemporary music, inclusive language. The particular Hebrew prayers and Jewish liturgical structure provide anchoring connection to tradition, while creative adaptation makes universal spiritual principles accessible to contemporary practitioners. Individual participants relate to these particular-universal syntheses through embodied practice—chanting, movement, meditation—that aims for universal experiences of connection, healing, and transformation within particular Jewish contexts. The concept of neo-Hasidism suggests that the universal mystical insights of historical Hasidic masters can be recovered through particular contemporary practices that adapt traditional forms. This creates a dynamic particular-universal relationship where individual spiritual seekers use particular Jewish forms as vehicles for universal experiences while simultaneously contributing to the ongoing universal evolution of Jewish spirituality through their particular creative innovations.

*** 1.20.184 Kabbalistic Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the complex system of divine emanations (sefirot) and the fundamental doctrine that all particular created reality participates in and manifests infinite divine light (Ein Sof), while simultaneously existing in varying degrees of separation and concealment from that universal source. The Kabbalistic framework, developed in texts like the Zohar and systematized by figures like Moses Cordovero and the Arizal, establishes that each individual created particular—from physical objects to human souls to angelic beings—occupies a specific position within the universal emanative hierarchy connecting infinite divinity to finite creation. The ten sefirot represent universal divine attributes and cosmic principles through which Ein Sof manifests, with each particular thing relating to these universals by embodying specific combinations and proportions of sefirah-energies.

The doctrine of tzimtzum (divine contraction) explains how universal infinite divine reality could produce particular finite creation. Ein Sof "contracted" itself to create conceptual space for otherness, allowing particular things to exist as apparently separate from universal divine reality. However, this separation is ultimately illusory—the Kabbalistic principle "leit atar panui minei" (there is no place void of Him) maintains that universal divine presence fills all particulars even in their apparent separateness. Individual things relate to divine universals through multiple dimensions simultaneously: their external physical form (guf), their vitalizing spiritual force (nefesh), their higher soul levels (ruach, neshamah), and their divine root in the sefirot. The more spiritually refined a particular thing, the more transparent it becomes to the universal divine light flowing through it.

The practice of mystical intention (kavvanah) in prayer and commandments demonstrates how individual actions relate to universal cosmic principles. Each particular mitzvah, when performed with proper spiritual intention, effects tikkun (repair or unification) in the upper sefirot, contributing to universal redemption. Individual human acts possess cosmic significance—particular prayers and deeds literally influence the flow of divine energy through universal sefirot-structure, affecting all reality. The doctrine of sparks (nitzotzot) further explains how particular material things contain sparks of universal divine light trapped in kelipot (shells or husks). Individual spiritual practice liberates these particular sparks, elevating them back to their universal divine source. The righteous person (tzaddik) relates most directly to universal divine principles, functioning as channel through which infinite divine blessing flows to particular created beings. This creates a rich particular-universal ontology where every individual thing simultaneously expresses and conceals, participates in and separates from, the universal infinite divine reality.

*** 1.20.185 Lurianic Kabbalah Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the dramatic cosmological narrative of tzimtzum (contraction), shevirat ha-kelim (breaking of vessels), and tikkun (repair), which explains how particular created reality emerged from universal divine infinity and how individual beings participate in universal cosmic restoration. The Lurianic system, developed by Isaac Luria (the Arizal) in sixteenth-century Safed and transmitted through disciples like Chaim Vital, establishes that before creation, universal Ein Sof (Infinite Divine) alone existed. Individual things could not exist within this absolute undifferentiated universal reality. The first tzimtzum—divine self-contraction—created primordial space (tehiru) within Ein Sof, allowing for particularity and differentiation. This initial universal withdrawal paradoxically enabled individual existence by making conceptual room for otherness.

The subsequent emanation of light into the primordial space and the catastrophic shevirat ha-kelim (breaking of the vessels) explains the present mixed state where particular things contain both divine sparks (nitzotzot) and limiting shells (kelipot). The vessels meant to contain universal divine light could not withstand its intensity and shattered, causing divine sparks to fall and become trapped in particular material forms. This cosmic catastrophe means that every individual thing in existence contains within it trapped universal divine light seeking liberation and restoration. The particular relates to universal through this dual structure: the external form or husk (kelipah) represents separation and limitation, while the inner divine spark represents continued participation in universal divine reality despite exile and concealment.

The doctrine of tikkun transforms the particular-universal relationship into an urgent redemptive project. Each individual human action—particularly performance of commandments (mitzvot) with proper intention (kavvanah)—liberates particular divine sparks, elevating them back toward their universal divine source and contributing to cosmic repair. Individual souls themselves derive from universal Primordial Adam (Adam Kadmon) and must accomplish their particular tikkunim (repairs) corresponding to their specific soul-root. The complexity intensifies with the doctrine of partzufim (divine configurations or personas)—structured relationships among sefirot that create dynamic particular manifestations of universal divine attributes. Individual prayer and spiritual practice influence these partzufim, affecting the flow of divine energy throughout universal creation. The righteous person's particular deeds possess cosmic significance, while the individual mystic who understands these relationships can intentionally direct particular actions toward specific universal repairs. This creates the most elaborate particular-universal metaphysics in Jewish tradition, where every individual particular simultaneously expresses cosmic exile and contains potential for universal redemption.
