*** 1.7.121 Korean Buddhism Response

Korean Buddhism conceives space (h허공, heogong) as the non-obstructive medium of dharmic interpenetration, where all phenomena exist in mutual containment through the principle of indra's net. This understanding synthesizes Huayan metaphysics with distinctly Korean soteriological pragmatism.

The tradition's spatial philosophy crystallized through Wonhyo (617-686 CE), whose Daesŭng Kisillon-so articulated space as the harmonization of all contradictions, and Jinul (1158-1210), who integrated sudden enlightenment-gradual cultivation (tonjo chomsu) with Huayan spatial theory in his Susimgyol. The modern reformer Han Yongun (1879-1944) reinterpreted traditional spatial concepts through engagement with Western physics and social movements, arguing space embodies Buddha-nature's democratic accessibility.

The Avatamsaka Sutra (Korean: Hwaŏm-gyong), particularly the chapter on Indra's net, provides canonical foundation. Wonhyo's concept of hwajaeng (和諍, harmonization of disputes) treats space as the locus where seemingly contradictory positions achieve non-dual resolution. Each point in space contains all other points, making the distinction between container and contained illusory.

Korean Buddhist spatial theory advances three core arguments. First, space exemplifies the hwadu principle of "nothing-whatsoever-ness" (무무, mu-mu), the absence that enables presence. Second, space manifests the interpenetration doctrine (相卽相入, sangjŭk sang-ip) where "one is many, many is one" without contradiction. Third, space demonstrates the non-obstruction of phenomena (事事無碍, sasa mu-ae), allowing mountains to walk and rivers to preach dharma, as Sŏsan Taesa (1520-1604) taught.

The Kumgang Sammaegyong (Diamond Sutra) states: "All dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and lightning," indicating space's dreamlike contingency. The Platform Sutra, influential in Korean practice, declares emptiness-space identical with Buddha-mind.

Internal variations exist between the Son (Zen) emphasis on space as meditation-ground and scholastic Kyo schools treating space analytically. The Jogye Order synthesizes both approaches, while Taego and Chontae orders preserve distinct interpretations.

Critics argue Korean Buddhism's spatial mysticism risks undermining conventional distinctions necessary for ethical action. Defenders respond that recognizing spatial interpenetration actually grounds compassion, since harming others harms oneself within mutually-containing reality.

Contemporary Korean Buddhist thinkers engage quantum entanglement as vindicating classical interpenetration theories. Temple architecture embodies spatial philosophy through borrowed scenery techniques, where boundaries between natural and constructed space dissolve, manifesting the tradition's core insight that separation itself occupies no real space.

*** 1.7.122 Vietnamese Buddhism Response

Vietnamese Buddhism conceptualizes space (không gian) as the luminous void (không tánh) where Mahayana emptiness merges with indigenous cosmological sensibilities rooted in agricultural cycles and ancestor veneration. Space functions as the compassionate matrix enabling karmic continuity across generations while remaining itself unborn and unceasing.

The tradition's spatial understanding developed through the Lý Dynasty monk Thông Biện (1099-1134), whose Thiền Uyển Tập Anh outlined space as consciousness's playground, and Trúc Lâm founder Trần Nhân Tông (1258-1308), who articulated "living-while-enlightened" (sinh hoạt thiền) spatial practice integrating monastic and householder life. Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926-2022) revolutionized spatial understanding through "interbeing" (tiếp hiện), describing space as the field of interdependent co-arising accessible through mindful breathing.

The Lotus Sutra (Pháp Hoa Kinh) provides doctrinal foundation, particularly teachings on the eternal Buddha manifesting throughout space-time. Vietnamese Buddhism emphasizes the Avatamsaka's interpenetration doctrine but filters it through Thiền (Zen) emphasis on direct realization and Pure Land devotional accessibility, creating a distinctly syncretic spatial ontology.

Three philosophical arguments structure Vietnamese Buddhist spatial theory. First, space exemplifies "neither-increasing-nor-decreasing" (bất tăng bất giảm) principle—whether empty or containing countless worlds, space's nature remains unchanged. Second, space demonstrates the inseparability of form and emptiness articulated in Heart Sutra: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (sắc tức thị không, không tức thị sắc). Third, space manifests as the "one mind" (nhất tâm) ground where Pure Land and Saha world interpenetrate.

The Platform Sutra declares: "From the first, not one thing exists," indicating space's primordial emptiness. Vietnamese liturgy invokes Avalokiteśvara as "perceiving the world's sounds" throughout space, emphasizing compassion's omnipresence.

Internal variations distinguish Northern scholastic approaches emphasizing theoretical understanding from Southern practice lineages stressing experiential realization. The unified Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha officially harmonizes perspectives while local temples maintain distinctive emphases.

Critics argue Vietnamese Buddhism's syncretism with spirit veneration contradicts rigorous emptiness doctrine. Proponents respond that honoring ancestors within space's emptiness demonstrates rather than violates non-dual understanding.

Contemporary applications include Thích Nhất Hạnh's "interbeing" ecology, which grounds environmental activism in recognizing space as the medium of mutual co-arising. Engaged Buddhism movements utilize spatial interpenetration theory to justify social intervention, arguing no isolated "spiritual space" exists apart from political-economic reality.

*** 1.7.123 Chinese Buddhism Response

Chinese Buddhism conceives space (空間, kongjian) through the foundational category of emptiness (空, kong), understood as the absence of inherent existence rather than nihilistic void. Space represents the dharmadhatu (法界, fajie), the realm of dharmas where all phenomena arise interdependently while lacking independent substance, synthesizing Indian Buddhist metaphysics with indigenous Chinese cosmological categories of qi and li.

The translation of Buddhist texts into Chinese created crucial conceptual innovations. Kumārajīva (344-413 CE) rendered śūnyatā as kong, linking Buddhist emptiness with Daoist wu (nothingness), profoundly shaping Chinese spatial understanding. The Tiantai master Zhiyi (538-597) articulated "three thousand realms in a single thought-moment" (一念三千, yinian sanqian), where space becomes mind's infinite expressive capacity. Fazang (643-712) systematized Huayan spatial philosophy through the haijin metaphor—reality as jeweled net where each node reflects all others infinitely.

The Heart Sutra (心經, Xinjing) provides canonical authority: "Form does not differ from emptiness, emptiness does not differ from form." The Vimalakīrti Sutra demonstrates space's paradoxical nature when Vimalakīrti contains Mt. Sumeru in his tiny room, displaying space's phenomenal relativity against absolute emptiness.

Chinese Buddhist spatial theory advances three core propositions. First, space exemplifies dependent origination (緣起, yuanqi)—spatial extension arises through conceptual imputation onto emptiness rather than existing substantially. Second, space manifests the mutual interpenetration (相即相入, xiangjik xiangru) where "one contains all, all contains one" without logical contradiction. Third, space demonstrates principle-phenomena non-obstruction (理事無碍, lishi wu'ai), allowing absolute and conventional truths to coexist.

The Avatamsaka Sutra declares: "Within a single atom exist countless lands; as within one atom, so in all." This passage grounds Chinese Buddhism's fractal spatial ontology.

Internal variations distinguish the gradual-cultivation schools (Tiantai, Huayan) treating space analytically from sudden-enlightenment Chan emphasizing direct perception beyond conceptual categories. Pure Land traditions subordinate spatial metaphysics to faith-based practice.

Critics influenced by Consciousness-Only (唯識, weishi) school argue treating space as genuinely empty neglects its status as mental construction. Madhyamaka defenders maintain precisely recognizing space as mental projection reveals its emptiness.

Contemporary Chinese Buddhism engages scientific cosmology, with masters like Taixu (1890-1947) and Yinshun (1906-2005) correlating Buddhist spatial theories with relativity and quantum mechanics, arguing ancient insights anticipate modern physics while retaining soteriological purpose.

*** 1.7.124 Japanese Zen Response

Japanese Zen conceptualizes space (空, kū) as the groundless ground of presencing, the nothing-whatsoever enabling somethingness to appear. Space functions not as container but as the absolute nothingness (絶対無, zettai mu) through which being and non-being interpenetrate, articulated through distinctly Japanese aesthetic-philosophical categories of ma (間, interval) and mu (無, nothingness).

The tradition's spatial philosophy developed through Dōgen Zenji (1200-1253), whose Shōbōgenzō revolutionized Buddhist ontology by treating space-time (有時, uji) as intrinsically unified. Each moment fully realizes the entire universe; each point contains all space. Hakuin Ekaku (1686-1768) emphasized space's koan-nature—the "sound of one hand clapping" reveals space's non-dual character. The Kyoto School philosopher Nishida Kitarō (1870-1945) articulated space as "place of absolute nothingness" (絶対無の場所, zettai mu no basho) where subject-object distinctions dissolve.

The Heart Sutra's core proclamation "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (色即是空、空即是色, shiki soku ze kū, kū soku ze shiki) provides doctrinal foundation. Dōgen's teaching that "mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers" after realization indicates space's absolute ordinariness when perceived without discriminating mind.

Zen spatial philosophy advances three fundamental insights. First, space exemplifies mu-no-mu (無の無), the negation of negation, moving beyond both being and nihilistic nothingness. Second, space manifests as the "ten thousand dharmas" (万法, manbō) spontaneously arising without origin or destination, like foam on water. Third, space demonstrates the non-duality of samsara and nirvana—this very world, without subtraction or addition, is Buddha-realm.

The Mumonkan states: "The Great Way has no gate; thousands of roads enter it. When one passes through this gateless gate, one freely walks between heaven and earth." Space itself is the gateless gate.

Internal variations distinguish Rinzai emphasis on space as breakthrough experience in kensho from Sōtō treating space as the seamless reality of shikantaza (just sitting). The Ōbaku school preserves Chinese influences, while Sanbo Kyodan modernizes traditional categories.

Critics argue Zen spatial mysticism neglects analytical rigor necessary for philosophical precision. Defenders respond that conceptual analysis itself operates within space's mystery, which direct experience alone penetrates.

Contemporary Zen engages spatial questions through aesthetics—rock gardens manifest emptiness-space through minimal elements, while tea ceremony architecture employs ma (negative space) to reveal space's active formative power. Environmental applications treat nature not as space containing objects but as space's self-manifestation.

*** 1.7.125 Korean Seon Response

Korean Seon conceptualizes space (허공, heogong) as the non-dwelling dharmakaya, the bodyless body of Buddha-nature pervading all locations while remaining locationless. Space represents the "original face before parents were born"—the unconditioned ground from which phenomenal extension emerges yet which no extension exhausts. This understanding synthesizes Chan metaphysics with Korean emphasis on sudden awakening to space's true nature.

The tradition's spatial philosophy developed through Bojo Jinul (1158-1210), whose integration of hwadu meditation with Huayan ontology treated space as the testing-ground of awakening. His doctrine of "sudden awakening followed by gradual cultivation" (돈오점수, dono jŏmsu) treats space as already-enlightened yet requiring realization through practice. Seongcheol (1912-1993) controversially argued for "sudden awakening sudden cultivation," treating space as instantaneously realized in totality. Kusan Sunim (1909-1983) popularized intensive meditation retreats (kyŏlche) as direct encounter with space's non-objective vastness.

The Platform Sutra's declaration "Originally not a single thing exists" (本來無一物, bonlae mu ilmul) provides canonical foundation. Korean Seon emphasizes the Avatamsaka teaching of interpenetration but filters it through hwadu practice—koans like "What is this?" (이뭣고?, imwŏtgo?) direct attention to space's pre-conceptual immediacy.

Three philosophical arguments structure Seon spatial theory. First, space exemplifies the "middle way beyond existence and nonexistence" (不有不無, bu-yu bu-mu)—neither substantial entity nor mere absence. Second, space demonstrates original enlightenment (本覺, bon-gak) principle: awakening doesn't create Buddha-nature in space but recognizes what already pervades it. Third, space manifests as "the one without second" (一切唯心, ilche yusim)—all spatial distinctions arise within and as consciousness.

The Diamond Sutra declares: "All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, dew and lightning." Korean commentaries emphasize space's inclusion within conditioned dharmas, thus itself dreamlike.

Internal variations distinguish the Jogye Order's integration of doctrinal study with meditation from the Taego Order's pure meditation emphasis. The Chontae school preserves Tiantai analytical approaches to space.

Critics argue Seon's sudden awakening doctrine risks antinomianism, treating space-realization as transcending ethical action. Defenders respond that genuine space-awakening necessarily manifests as compassion since recognizing spatial non-separation dissolves self-other barriers.

Contemporary Korean Seon applies spatial understanding through temple architecture utilizing "borrowed scenery" (차경, cha-gyŏng), dissolving boundaries between constructed and natural space. Urban meditation centers teach spatial awareness as stress-reduction, secularizing traditional doctrines while preserving contemplative core.

*** 1.7.126 Vietnamese Thien Response

Vietnamese Thien conceptualizes space (không gian) as the luminous emptiness (không quang minh) where meditation practice and daily life interpenetrate without boundary. Space functions as the compassionate void enabling the "living meditation" (thiền sinh hoạt) characteristic of Vietnamese Buddhism's integration of monastic rigor with householder accessibility. This understanding uniquely synthesizes Chan metaphysics with indigenous Vietnamese cosmology emphasizing harmonious relationship between human, natural, and ancestral realms.

The tradition's spatial philosophy crystallized through Trần Nhân Tông (1258-1308), warrior-king turned monk, whose Thiền Tông Chỉ Nam articulated space as the seamless reality where enlightenment and governance, withdrawal and engagement, mutually complete each other. Liễu Quán (1670-1742) systematized the Vietnamese teaching of "ten methods for entering meditation" (thập nhập môn), treating space as accessible through multiple doorways rather than single technique. Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926-2022) revolutionized contemporary understanding through "interbeing" (tiếp hiện), describing space as the relational field where nothing exists independently.

The Lotus Sutra (Kinh Pháp Hoa) provides canonical authority, particularly the doctrine of skillful means enabling Buddha's simultaneous presence throughout space. Vietnamese liturgy emphasizes Avalokiteśvara's universal hearing, treating space as acoustic medium of compassion rather than visual extension.

Three philosophical arguments ground Thien spatial theory. First, space exemplifies the principle "mind is Buddha, Buddha is mind" (tâm tức thị Phật, Phật tức thị tâm)—spatial extension and mental awareness form non-dual reality. Second, space demonstrates "neither increasing nor decreasing" (bất tăng bất giảm)—whether containing one world or countless realms, space's nature remains unchanged. Third, space manifests the interpenetration of Pure Land and ordinary world, collapsing spatial separation between sacred and mundane.

The Platform Sutra declares: "From the first, not one thing exists." Vietnamese commentaries emphasize this doesn't negate appearance but reveals appearance's empty nature.

Internal variations distinguish Northern traditions emphasizing doctrinal understanding from Southern practice lineages stressing experiential realization. The Unified Buddhist Church officially harmonizes approaches while regional temples maintain distinctive characteristics.

Critics argue Vietnamese Thien's integration of ancestor veneration contradicts rigorous emptiness teaching. Proponents respond that honoring ancestors within space's emptiness demonstrates non-dual understanding—form and emptiness coexist without contradiction.

Contemporary applications include Plum Village monasteries' walking meditation practice, treating everyday movement through space as awakening opportunity. Engaged Buddhism movements apply "interbeing" spatial philosophy to environmental and peace activism, arguing that recognizing spatial interdependence grounds ethical responsibility. Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions secularize traditional spatial awareness practices while preserving contemplative essence.

*** 1.7.127 Shugendo Response

Shugendo conceives space (空間, kūkan) as the sacred field of yamabushi practice, where mountain topography becomes mandala and physical ascent manifests spiritual realization. Space represents the body of Fudō Myōō (不動明王), the Immovable Wisdom King, whose fierce compassion pervades peaks, valleys, and dangerous passages. This understanding uniquely synthesizes esoteric Buddhism, Shinto kami-worship, and Daoist mountain asceticism into a distinctly Japanese mountain religion.

The tradition's spatial philosophy developed through En no Gyōja (c. 634-706 CE), the legendary founder whose supernatural powers demonstrated mastery over spatial limitations—flying between mountains and commanding deities across distances. The medieval systematizer Shōbō (832-909) established Mt. Ōmine practice connecting specific geographical locations with stages of enlightenment. Contemporary master Miyake Hitoshi (1922-2006) documented Shugendo spatial concepts, showing how pilgrimage routes (mine-iri) transform ordinary topography into soteriological geography.

The Mahavairocana Sutra (大日経, Dainichi-kyō) provides doctrinal foundation, teaching that the cosmos is Dainichi Nyorai's body—mountains thus represent the Buddha's physical form. The Lotus Sutra's teachings on skillful means justify adapting Buddhist doctrine to Japan's mountainous landscape, while Shinto concepts of yorishiro (依代, divine vessels) inform understanding of peaks as spaces where kami descend.

Shugendo advances three core spatial principles. First, space embodies the mandala structure of Diamond and Womb realms (金胎両部曼荼羅, Kontai ryōbu mandara)—practitioners physically enter mandala space through mountain ascent. Second, space manifests as the testing ground of ascetic practice; enduring spatial extremes (cold peaks, treacherous paths) burns karmic obscurations. Third, space demonstrates honji suijaku (本地垂迹) principle: universal Buddhist truth (honji) manifests through local spatial-divine phenomena (suijaku).

Shugendo liturgy proclaims: "The three mysteries of body, speech, and mind unite in this very place." Mountains aren't symbols of enlightenment but its actual locus.

Internal variations distinguish the Tozan-ha sect centered on Mt. Ōmine emphasizing Buddhist elements from Honzan-ha at Mt. Haguro stressing Shinto aspects. Regional mountains develop unique spatial practices reflecting local kami and historical lineages.

Critics argue Shugendo's identification of specific locations with salvific power contradicts Buddhist teaching on emptiness's universality. Defenders respond that recognizing sacred space doesn't deny emptiness but skillfully employs form to realize it.

Contemporary Shugendo maintains mountain pilgrimage circuits despite modern accessibility, arguing physical ordeal in dangerous space remains irreplaceable for authentic realization. Environmental activism emerges from spatial philosophy: protecting mountains as sacred space grounds conservation efforts. Some practitioners engage body-centered phenomenology, correlating Shugendo spatial experience with Merleau-Ponty's embodied space.

*** 1.7.128 Tenrikyo Response

Tenrikyo conceptualizes space as the visible manifestation of Oyagami's (God the Parent) creative providence, centered on the Jiba (地場), the place of human origin in present-day Tenri City. Space represents the body lent by Oyagami—neither owned nor intrinsically belonging to humans but granted temporarily for spiritual growth through hinokishin (日々の進, daily service). This understanding uniquely positions spatial existence as gift requiring grateful reciprocation through joyous living.

The tradition's spatial philosophy originated through foundress Nakayama Miki (1798-1887), who identified the specific location where Oyagami created humanity. Her Ofudesaki (Tip of the Divine Writing Brush) reveals space as Oyagami's body: "Looking all over the world and through all ages, I find no one who has understood My heart. So should I, Oyasama, teach it to you?" (Ofudesaki I:1-3). The doctrine of kashimono-karimono (借り物, things lent) treats spatial extension, including human bodies occupying space, as borrowed from divine generosity.

The Mikagura-uta (Sacred Songs) performed around the Kanrodai (甘露台, Stand for Heavenly Dew) at the Jiba ritually enacts space's centrifugal structure—all space radiates from creation's original point. The Doctrine of Tenrikyo explains: "God the Parent created human beings to see their joyous life and thus share in their joy."

Three philosophical arguments structure Tenrikyo spatial theory. First, space manifests hierarchical geography centered on the Jiba—proximity to origin-point correlates with spiritual significance, motivating pilgrimage (ojiba-gaeri). Second, space exemplifies the kashimono-karimono principle: humans don't possess space but temporarily inhabit it, generating gratitude and responsibility. Third, space demonstrates yoki-gurashi (陽気ぐらし, joyous life) potential: rightly understanding spatial existence as divine gift enables the joyous living that fulfills creation's purpose.

The Ofudesaki declares: "This place is the residence of Kami, the origin of all things" (III:40). Space's sacredness concentrates at creation's axis while extending universally.

Internal variations exist between conservative members emphasizing literal geographic centrality of Jiba and progressive interpreters treating spatial teachings metaphorically as spiritual principles applicable universally.

Critics argue Tenrikyo's geocentric spatial theology conflicts with cosmological science and risks nationalist implications. Defenders respond that spiritual geography operates on different register than physical cosmology; the Jiba's centrality is soteriological, not astronomical.

Contemporary Tenrikyo maintains pilgrimage emphasis despite globalization, with diaspora communities worldwide orienting practice toward Tenri City. Social welfare activities (hinokishin) express spatial philosophy: serving others in their specific spatial contexts manifests gratitude for borrowed existence. Architectural projects embody spatial centrality through buildings radiating from Jiba, materializing cosmological doctrine.

*** 1.7.129 Konkokyo Response

Konkokyo conceptualizes space as the field of aidaigara (あいだがら, mutual relations) where Kami (Tenchi Kane no Kami, Golden Kami of Heaven and Earth) and humanity collaborate in continuous creation. Space represents the mediating realm enabling the sacred encounter between divine and human, neither exclusively transcendent nor immanent but constituted through ongoing relationship. This understanding emerged from founder Bunjiro Kawate's (1814-1883) mystical experiences emphasizing reciprocal dependency between Kami and believers.

The tradition's spatial philosophy originated through Kawate's transformation into Konko Daijin (Golden Light Great Kami) following communication with Kami in 1859. His Gorikai (理解, Divine Reminders) articulate space as the location of toritsugi (取次, divine mediation): "Without Kami, people cannot exist; without people, the divine virtue cannot be revealed. Kami and people are two yet one." This relational ontology treats space not as static container but as dynamic between-ness.

The core text Konkokyo Kyoten (金光教教典, Konkokyo Scripture) emphasizes space's mediational character: sacred and mundane spaces aren't ontologically separate but relationally distinguished through practice of toritsugi-mediation. The teaching of ikigami (生き神, living Kami) dissolves spatial separation between divine heaven and earthly realm.

Three philosophical arguments structure Konkokyo spatial theory. First, space exemplifies aidaigara principle: nothing exists independently but only through relationships, making space itself a relational rather than substantial reality. Second, space manifests as the locus of okage (お陰, divine blessings)—spatial existence itself constitutes blessing requiring grateful acknowledgment. Third, space demonstrates the interpenetration of visible and invisible worlds: Kami pervades space while remaining irreducible to spatial categories.

Founder's teachings declare: "Kami exists in all directions—east, west, south, north, above, and below. There is no place where Kami is not present." Yet Kami's presence requires human recognition and mediation.

Internal variations distinguish urban churches emphasizing individual consultation from traditional rural communities practicing collective worship. Conservative members preserve founder's original spatial practices, while progressive interpreters adapt teachings to modern contexts.

Critics argue Konkokyo's emphasis on reciprocal divine-human dependency compromises divine transcendence. Defenders respond that mutual reliance doesn't diminish Kami but reveals the profundity of divine-human collaboration.

Contemporary Konkokyo applies spatial philosophy through mediation practice: ordained ministers serve as toritsugi, creating sacred space enabling divine-human encounter wherever practiced. Social engagement programs treat community spaces as locations for manifesting aidaigara, building relationships reflecting cosmic interconnection. International expansion raises questions about spatial relationship between Japanese origins and global presence, with varying interpretations of whether Konkokyo's aidaigara transcends cultural-spatial particularity.

*** 1.7.130 Oomoto Response

Oomoto conceptualizes space as the manifestation of Ushitora no Konjin's (艮の金神, Golden Kami of the Northeast) cosmic restructuring, where physical space mirrors spiritual realms undergoing eschatological transformation. Space represents the material dimension of tatekae tatenaoshi (立替立直, destruction and reconstruction), the prophesied cosmic renewal eliminating evil and establishing divine kingdom on earth. This understanding emerged from foundress Nao Deguchi's (1837-1918) apocalyptic revelations announcing imminent spatial-temporal upheaval.

The tradition's spatial philosophy developed through Nao Deguchi's Ofudesaki, proclaiming: "The Greater World shall burst into bloom as plum blossoms at winter's end." Her successor Onisaburo Deguchi (1871-1948) systematized teachings through Reikai Monogatari (Tales of the Spirit World), elaborating correspondences between spiritual and physical spatial dimensions. His concept of taigenkyō (体現境, manifested realm) treats visible space as condensation of invisible spiritual realities, creating multi-layered spatial ontology.

The Oomoto Shinyu (大本神諭, Divine Revelations of Oomoto) provides doctrinal foundation, announcing spatial transformation: "This world will be entirely remade. The present world's foundation must be changed." This eschatological spatial vision distinguishes Oomoto from gradual-reform traditions.

Three philosophical arguments structure Oomoto spatial theory. First, space manifests hierarchical structure of three worlds (sangai): divine realm (shinkai), spiritual realm (reikai), and physical realm (kenkai)—events in higher spatial dimensions determine lower manifestations. Second, space demonstrates the principle of kagami (鏡, mirror): physical space reflects spiritual conditions, making spatial transformation index of spiritual progress toward divine kingdom. Third, space embodies tension between present corrupt condition and imminent purified state, creating spatial eschatology.

Ofudesaki declares: "When the plum blossoms bloom, when spring arrives, the Greater World shall be reconstructed." Physical space's seasonal transformation prefigures cosmic renewal.

Internal variations distinguish conservative members maintaining apocalyptic urgency from progressive interpreters treating spatial transformation metaphorically as ongoing spiritual process. The 1935 government suppression for lèse-majesté generated internal debates about political implications of spatial teachings.

Critics argue Oomoto's apocalypticism promotes spatial catastrophism incompatible with environmental stewardship. Defenders respond that tatekae tatenaoshi motivates ethical living precisely by emphasizing consequences of spatial degradation.

Contemporary Oomoto applies spatial philosophy through Esperanto promotion, treating linguistic space as requiring unification matching cosmic restructuring. Artistic activities (tea ceremony, Noh theater, calligraphy) create sacred spaces prefiguring renewed world. The Jinrui Aizenkai (Human Love and Respect Association) grounds peace activism in spatial teaching: global unity reflects spiritual realm's spatial harmony.

*** 1.7.131 Seicho-no-Ie Response

Seicho-no-Ie conceptualizes space as the illusory projection of mind, lacking independent reality beyond consciousness's creative power. Space represents the phenomenal manifestation of the jissō (実相, true reality) realm, where all apparent spatial extension dissolves into the perfect divine mind. This understanding, articulated by founder Taniguchi Masaharu (1893-1985), synthesizes New Thought metaphysics, Buddhist idealism, and Christian Science into distinctly Japanese "life philosophy."

The tradition's spatial philosophy emerged through Taniguchi's 1930 enlightenment experience revealing material space as illusion. His foundational text Seimei no Jissō (生命の実相, The Truth of Life) proclaims: "Matter does not exist. The real world is the world of mind." This radical idealism treats spatial extension as mental construct projected onto the empty canvas of absolute mind. Subsequent leaders Taniguchi Seicho (1919-2008) and Taniguchi Masanobu (b. 1951) developed ecological applications while maintaining core spatial idealism.

The Shinsokan meditation (神想観, meditation for God-realization) provides practical method for transcending spatial illusion: practitioners visualize dissolving spatial boundaries until recognizing only infinite divine mind. The Amaterasu Ōmikami worship grounds teachings in Japanese tradition while affirming universal divine presence throughout space.

Three philosophical arguments structure Seicho-no-Ie spatial theory. First, space exemplifies the principle "mind creates phenomena" (心現象, shin-genshō)—spatial perception arises through consciousness rather than existing independently. Second, space demonstrates the distinction between jissō (true reality of perfect divinity) and genshō (現象, illusory phenomena): apparent space belongs to phenomenal illusion requiring transcendence through right understanding. Third, space reveals the power of kotodama (言霊, word-spirit): speaking divine truth transforms spatial experience by aligning consciousness with true reality.

Seimei no Jissō declares: "In truth, there is neither disease nor death. There is only the eternal, perfect life of God." Spatial finitude likewise proves illusory when true vision awakens.

Internal variations distinguish conservative members emphasizing idealism literally from progressive ecologists integrating environmentalism requiring treating physical space seriously. Taniguchi Masanobu's "nature protection as religious mission" marks significant doctrinal development.

Critics argue Seicho-no-Ie's spatial idealism risks neglecting material suffering and environmental crisis. Defenders respond that recognizing spatial illusion doesn't deny pragmatic reality but grounds its transformation through consciousness-shifting.

Contemporary Seicho-no-Ie applies spatial philosophy through visualization practices healing spatial dislocation (illness, poverty) by recognizing underlying perfection. Environmental activism, prominent since 1990s, reinterprets spatial teachings: protecting physical space manifests divine perfection rather than contradicting illusionism. International expansion raises questions about spatial relationship between Japanese origins and universal truth claims.

*** 1.7.132 Perfect Liberty Kyodan Response

Perfect Liberty Kyodan (PL) conceptualizes space as the canvas for artistic self-expression, where divine creative force (親神, Oya-gami) manifests through individual human artistry. Space represents the medium enabling the tradition's core teaching: "Life is Art" (人生は芸術である, Jinsei wa geijutsu de aru). This understanding, developed by founder Tokuchika Miki (1900-1983) from predecessor Tokuharu Miki's (1871-1938) teachings, treats spatial existence not as illusory or problematic but as the positive field for manifesting divine beauty through creative living.

The tradition's spatial philosophy crystallized in PL's 21 Precepts, particularly the first: "Life is Art." This foundational principle treats space as the gallery-stage where each person's unique artistic expression unfolds. The teaching of jiko hyōgen (自己表現, self-expression) positions spatial existence as opportunity rather than obstacle—occupying space enables rather than restricts divine creativity. Miki's emphasis on makoto no jibun (真の自分, true self) treats authentic spatial presence as religious practice.

The PL teachings affirm: "Man is a manifestation of God. All his thoughts and deeds are the expression of God." Spatial location and extension thus become divine self-revelation through human creativity. The practice of oshie (御教え, divine guidance) treats spatial circumstances as customized lessons from Oya-gami.

Three philosophical arguments structure PL spatial theory. First, space exemplifies the principle of divine individualized expression: each person's unique spatial location provides distinct material for artistic life-creation. Second, space demonstrates non-dualism between sacred and mundane: everyday spatial activities (cooking, sports, work) become religious practice when performed as conscious art. Third, space manifests as the relational field connecting individual expression with collective harmony—true self-expression enhances rather than disrupts spatial community.

PL liturgy proclaims: "May my life become a perfect work of art." Spatial existence provides the three-dimensional medium for this artistic realization.

Internal variations distinguish members emphasizing traditional Japanese arts from those exploring contemporary creative expressions. The tradition's golf course and baseball team reflect applied spatial philosophy: sports become spaces for manifesting artistic living.

Critics argue PL's aesthetic spatial philosophy lacks rigorous metaphysical foundation, reducing religion to lifestyle enhancement. Defenders respond that treating life as art grounds profound spiritual practice precisely through everyday spatial engagement.

Contemporary PL applies spatial philosophy through diverse creative activities: ikebana, calligraphy, dance, and sports all become religious practices transforming space into art. The annual PL Fireworks Festival Art expresses doctrine spatially—pyrotechnic displays temporarily transform night sky into divine artistic expression. International membership raises questions about whether "Life is Art" philosophy transcends cultural-spatial particularity or remains embedded in Japanese aesthetic sensibilities.

*** 1.7.133 Zoroastrianism Response

Zoroastrianism conceptualizes space as the battlefield between Ahura Mazda's creative order (asha) and Angra Mainyu's destructive chaos, where material extension manifests the fundamental cosmic dualism. Space represents the good creation requiring protection from evil contamination through ritual purification and righteous action. This understanding positions spatial existence as inherently valuable yet perpetually threatened, grounding Zoroastrian environmental ethics in theological cosmology.

The tradition's spatial philosophy originated through Zarathushtra (c. 1500-1000 BCE), whose Gathas revolutionized Iranian religion by proclaiming Ahura Mazda's creation of material world as positive good against earlier dualistic pessimism. The Bundahishn (Creation), a 9th-century CE Pahlavi text, systematizes spatial cosmology: Ahura Mazda created world in seven stages, with space (thwasha) as primordial element enabling subsequent creations. The medieval theologian Mardanfarrukh defended spatial creation's goodness against Manichaean claims that matter is evil.

The Yasna 30.3-5 declares Ahura Mazda created "the sky, water, earth, plants, animals, and humans" through asha (cosmic order). The Vendidad details spatial purity laws: corpse contamination spreads spatially, requiring specific purification rituals to restore space's sacred character.

Three philosophical arguments structure Zoroastrian spatial theory. First, space manifests asha (ordered truth) rather than druj (deceptive chaos)—spatial relations follow divinely established patterns requiring human maintenance. Second, space embodies the good creation (getig) temporarily infiltrated by evil but ultimately destined for renovation (frashegird) when Angra Mainyu faces final defeat. Third, space demonstrates progressive revelation principle: as fravashis (guardian spirits) descend into material realm, space becomes arena for cosmic struggle's resolution.

The Bundahishn describes creation's spatial structure: "First he created the sky, then water, then earth, then plants, then cattle, then man." Each spatial domain serves specific purpose in cosmic order.

Internal variations distinguish traditional Parsi communities in India emphasizing ritual purity from Iranian Zoroastrians adapting practices to Muslim-majority context. The Ilm-e-Khshnoom school develops mystical spatial interpretations.

Critics argue Zoroastrian spatial dualism leads to excessive purity restrictions, limiting natural interaction with physical world. Defenders respond that purification rituals honor rather than denigrate material space.

Contemporary Zoroastrianism applies spatial philosophy through environmental activism: protecting creation from pollution manifests religious duty. Diaspora communities debate whether sacred space requires specific geography (Iran) or travels with practicing communities. Some scholars correlate Zoroastrian cosmology with scientific Big Bang theory, arguing ancient texts anticipate modern spatial expansion concepts.

*** 1.7.134 Parsism Response

Parsism (Parsi Zoroastrianism) conceptualizes space through the doctrine of humata, hukhta, hvarshta (good thoughts, good words, good deeds) manifesting in material realm requiring ritual protection. Space represents Ahura Mazda's good creation now preserved by Parsi community following seventh-century flight from Iran to India. This understanding adapts Persian Zoroastrian cosmology to South Asian context, developing distinctive spatial practices around fire temples and dokhmas (towers of silence) that materialize theological principles.

The tradition's spatial philosophy developed through maintaining Iranian heritage in Indian diaspora. The Qissa-i Sanjan (Story of Sanjan, composed 16th-17th centuries) narrates founding myth: Parsi refugees arriving in Gujarat received asylum by promising to sweeten local culture "like sugar in milk" without displacing it. This spatial metaphor grounds Parsi self-understanding as beneficial presence in adopted land. The reformer Dastur Dhalla (1875-1956) modernized spatial interpretations while maintaining traditional practices. Contemporary high priest Dastur Firoze Kotwal (b. 1940) defends traditional spatial regulations against reformist modifications.

The Avestan texts (Yasna, Visperad, Vendidad) provide canonical authority, with Vendidad's purity laws particularly shaping spatial practice. The Pahlavi Bundahishn describes cosmic geography: earth divided into seven regions (kishwars), with Parsi settlements representing asha's outposts within mixed territory.

Three philosophical arguments structure Parsi spatial theory. First, space manifests inherent vulnerability to pollution requiring constant ritual vigilance—corpse matter, menstrual blood, and other pollutants contaminate space, necessitating purification before asha can flourish. Second, space demonstrates concentric sacredness: fire temples represent maximally pure space, with purity degrading outward through gradations requiring appropriate behavioral modifications. Third, space embodies diaspora tension: maintaining Persian spatial practices in Indian context preserves religious identity while adapting to local conditions.

The Vendidad proclaims: "The corpse is the most deadly poison; it shall not defile the earth of Ahura Mazda." This grounds elaborate spatial restrictions on death's location and handling.

Internal variations distinguish orthodox communities maintaining strict spatial purity from reformists questioning hereditary priesthood's spatial monopolies. The question of whether converts can occupy same sacred space as born Parsis generates intense debate.

Critics argue Parsi spatial restrictions perpetuate caste-like hierarchies and exclude potential members. Defenders respond that preserving spatial purity maintains religious integrity against assimilative pressures.

Contemporary Parsism faces spatial crises: declining population threatens maintaining fire temples; dokhma practice faces legal challenges in urban India as vulture populations collapse. Diaspora communities in North America and Europe debate whether sacred space requires specific architecture or adapts to local contexts. Environmental activists draw on traditional spatial ethics to ground conservation efforts.

*** 1.7.135 Zurvanism Response

Zurvanism conceptualizes space as emanation from Zurvan (Infinite Time), the primordial principle preceding and containing both Ahura Mazda (order) and Angra Mainyu (chaos). Space represents temporal extension's spatial correlate—as time unfolds, space manifests the stage for cosmic drama's predetermined duration. This understanding, controversial within Zoroastrian tradition, treats space as subordinate to time, reversing orthodox emphasis on Ahura Mazda's primacy.

The tradition's spatial philosophy developed during Sasanian period (224-651 CE), when Zurvanite theology influenced royal ideology. The Armenian writer Eznik of Kolb (5th century CE) reports Zurvanite teaching that Zurvan, doubting whether his sacrifice would produce offspring, accidentally generated both good (Ahura Mazda) and evil (Angra Mainyu) twins. Space thus originates from primordial uncertainty rather than purposeful creation. Zaehner's (1913-1974) controversial interpretation treats Zurvanism as fatalistic determinism where spatial events unfold according to predetermined temporal pattern.

The Pahlavi text Menog-i Khrad preserves Zurvanite cosmology, though orthodoxy later suppressed explicit Zurvanite doctrines. The teaching that cosmic history spans 12,000 years divided into four 3,000-year periods treats space as temporal manifestation: each epoch brings spatial transformations predetermined by Zurvan's original emanation.

Three philosophical arguments structure Zurvanite spatial theory. First, space exemplifies the principle of temporal priority: Zurvan's infinite time logically precedes and grounds spatial extension, making space derivative rather than fundamental. Second, space demonstrates cosmic determinism: spatial configurations unfold according to predetermined temporal schedule, limiting freedom within spatial realm. Third, space manifests tragic dualism: unlike orthodox Zoroastrianism promising Ahura Mazda's ultimate victory, Zurvanite space remains eternally divided between equal opposing forces.

Zurvanite texts proclaim: "Zurvan created both Ohrmazd and Ahriman; to Ohrmazd he gave the sovereignty of creation for 9,000 years." Space exists within this negotiated temporal framework.

Internal variations distinguish absolute Zurvanites treating Zurvan as truly supreme from moderate versions maintaining Ahura Mazda's practical supremacy while acknowledging temporal framework. Orthodox Zoroastrians reject Zurvanism entirely as heresy.

Critics argue Zurvanism undermines ethical action by introducing fatalism: if spatial events predetermined, human choices become meaningless. Defenders respond that working within temporal limits doesn't eliminate moral responsibility.

Contemporary scholarship debates Zurvanism's extent—some argue it represents major historical tradition, others dismiss it as minor heresy exaggerated by hostile sources. No practicing Zurvanite communities survive, making contemporary application speculative. However, Zurvanism's emphasis on time's primacy over space resonates with modern physics (spacetime continuum, block universe theories), prompting philosophical interest. Some interpreters correlate Zurvan with Einsteinian spacetime, arguing ancient intuition anticipated relativity's temporal-spatial fusion.
