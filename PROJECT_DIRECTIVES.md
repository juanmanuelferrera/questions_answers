# PROJECT DIRECTIVES: Grandes Preguntas, Diversas Respuestas

## CRITICAL RULE: Always Consult Auxiliary Documents

**Before creating, editing, or working on ANY chapter or part of this book, you MUST:**

1. **Read the master structure documents:**
   - `LIBRO_MAESTRO.org` - Contains the conceptual framework (Prothero model), all 12 chapter outlines, and tradition-specific responses
   - `BOOK_STRUCTURE.org` - Contains the reorganized structure by human problems, chapter status, and content mapping
   - `BOOK_SYNTHESIS.org` - Contains synthesized philosophical responses from all traditions

2. **Understand the current state:**
   - Check which chapters are complete vs. in progress
   - Review what content already exists for the topic
   - Identify which traditions have been covered

3. **Maintain consistency:**
   - Follow the established voice and tone from `CAPITULO_MUESTRA.org`
   - Use the same character framework (Elena, her grandfather Antonio, the teachers)
   - Preserve the narrative structure: problem → journey → encounter → insight

## Chapter Structure Template

Each chapter (~15-18 pages) follows this format:

1. **Apertura** (1/2 page): Provocative scene or question
2. **El problema** (1 page): Why this question matters
3. **Las respuestas** (10-12 pages): 8-10 traditions, ~1 page each
4. **Puntos de encuentro** (1 page): What traditions share
5. **Tensiones irresolubles** (1/2 page): Fundamental differences
6. **Para reflexionar** (1/2 page): 3 questions for the reader

## Narrative Framework: Life of Pi Style

- **Protagonist**: Elena (38, journalist, divorced, grieving, searching)
- **Catalyst**: Her grandfather Antonio's posthumous legacy
- **Structure**: Elena travels to meet teachers who helped her grandfather
- **Teachers include**:
  - Hermano Tomás (Montserrat - Christianity)
  - Ibrahim al-Fassi (Fez - Sufism/Islam)
  - Others TBD from the grandfather's list

## The Prothero Model (Problem → Solution)

Every tradition is presented through:
- **PROBLEMA**: The central human problem they address
- **SOLUCIÓN**: Their distinctive answer
- **TÉCNICA**: Practical path/method
- **EJEMPLAR**: Model figure who embodies it

## Quality Standards

### Voice
- Personal but not egocentric
- Respectful of all traditions without false neutrality
- Capable of genuine wonder
- Honest about uncertainties
- NO over-the-top praise or excessive validation

### Accessibility
- Convert academic language to conversational
- Use concrete examples and stories
- Keep responses to ~200 words maximum per tradition
- Make philosophy feel urgent and personal, not abstract

### CRITICAL: The 50/50 Balance Rule
**Target: 50% narrative / 50% philosophy** (NOT 70/30 which exhausts readers)

**Narrative elements should include:**
- Character conflict and personal stakes
- Sensory details and scene-setting
- Dialogue that reveals character, not just explains ideas
- Emotional beats and transformations
- Mystery, revelations, and hooks

**Philosophy should:**
- Emerge from crisis, not lectures
- Focus on 3-5 DEEP concepts per chapter (not 8-10 superficial ones)
- Use concrete examples, not abstract explanations
- Come through lived experience and dialogue
- Avoid academic jargon unless absolutely necessary

### Narrative Integration
- Philosophy emerges from character crisis, not lectures
- Data arrives as discovery, not exposition
- Each encounter transforms Elena subtly
- Questions build throughout the journey

### Chapter Hooks (MANDATORY)
**Every chapter MUST have:**

1. **Opening hook** (first 2 paragraphs):
   - Start with action, mystery, or provocative question
   - Make reader want to know what happens next
   - Reference GANCHOS_COMPLETOS.org for each chapter

2. **Mid-chapter tension**:
   - Personal conflict between characters
   - Revelation that changes Elena's understanding
   - Philosophical crisis that affects her personally

3. **Closing hook** (last page):
   - Revelation/mystery that propels to next chapter
   - Unanswered question that haunts the reader
   - New information about Antonio's past
   - Reference GANCHOS_COMPLETOS.org for specific hooks
