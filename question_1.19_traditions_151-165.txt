*** 1.19.151 Satyananda Yoga (Bihar School) Response

Satyananda Yoga, systematized by Swami Satyananda Saraswati (1923-2009) through the Bihar School of Yoga, maintains that space and time are manifestations of consciousness (chit) rather than independent realities, functioning as necessary frameworks for phenomenal experience while remaining subordinate to ultimate awareness. The tradition developed through Satyananda's synthesis of tantric philosophy with practical yoga methodology during the 1960s-1980s, establishing systematic teachings that integrate Advaita Vedanta with Kashmir Shaivism perspectives. Key texts include "Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha" (1969), "Kundalini Tantra" (1984), and "Sure Ways to Self-Realization" (1980), which articulate sophisticated understandings of spatiotemporal manifestation emerging from consciousness. Satyananda's framework employs technical terminology including akasha-tattva (space element), kala-tattva (time principle), and chitta-akasha (mental space), arguing that physical space-time emerges through progressive tattva evolution from undifferentiated consciousness. The tradition distinguishes between bahya-akasha (outer space), chitta-akasha (mental space), and chidakasha (consciousness space), with each level representing increasingly subtle dimensions of spatial manifestation. Following Yoga Sutras principles, particularly YS 3.14-15 on transformation (parinama) of dharma, lakshana, and avastha, the tradition argues that temporal succession itself arises from consciousness rather than existing independently. Internal variations exist between practitioners emphasizing tantric cosmology versus those favoring Advaita non-dualism, though both maintain consciousness-primacy. Counter-arguments from materialist positions suggesting space-time independence are addressed through experiential evidence from advanced meditation states (samadhi) where practitioners report transcending ordinary spatiotemporal constraints. Contemporary applications engage quantum physics and relativity theory, with Satyananda Yoga interpreting quantum non-locality and spacetime relativity as validating yogic insights about consciousness-generated spatial-temporal frameworks. The tradition's yoga nidra (yogic sleep) practices provide systematic methodology for experiencing consciousness independent of ordinary space-time. Comparative analysis reveals alignment with Advaita Vedanta's maya doctrine and Kashmir Shaivism's spanda (vibration) theory, while differing from Samkhya's prakrti-based materialism and Buddhist Madhyamaka's emphasis on emptiness over consciousness. The Bihar School's systematic presentation through pranayama practices affecting subtle energy channels (nadis) demonstrates practical exploration of space-time's dependence on consciousness through yogic technology rather than purely philosophical speculation.

*** 1.19.152 Sivananda Yoga (Divine Life Society) Response

Sivananda Yoga, founded by Swami Sivananda Saraswati (1887-1963) through the Divine Life Society, teaches that space and time are phenomenal appearances within Brahman rather than independent existents, serving as practical frameworks for embodied experience while remaining ultimately illusory projections of maya. The tradition crystallized during Sivananda's Rishikesh period (1924-1963), developing through extensive writings that synthesized Advaita Vedanta, Raja Yoga, and devotional practices into accessible teachings. Foundational texts include "Brahma Sutras" (1949), "Essence of Yoga" (1957), and the comprehensive "Bliss Divine" (1964), which articulate systematic positions on space-time's derivative nature from absolute consciousness. Sivananda's philosophical framework employs technical terminology including desha-kala-nimitta (space-time-causation triad), vivarta-vada (apparent transformation theory), and adhyasa (superimposition), arguing that spatiotemporal experience represents brahman misperceived through ignorance (avidya). The tradition distinguishes between paramarthika (absolute), vyavaharika (empirical), and pratibhasika (illusory) levels of reality, positioning space-time within vyavaharika reality—practically real but ultimately false. Drawing upon Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1's teaching that existence alone was real "in the beginning," Sivananda argues temporal succession presupposes eternal consciousness rather than self-subsisting time. Internal variations exist between practitioners emphasizing jnana-yoga (knowledge path) versus bhakti-yoga (devotional path), though both affirm Brahman's primacy over space-time. Counter-arguments from scientific materialism are addressed through Sivananda's integrative approach acknowledging empirical validity of physics while maintaining its epistemological limitations. Contemporary applications engage Einstein's relativity, with Sivananda Yoga interpreting spacetime curvature as confirming Vedantic insights about reality's malleability through consciousness. The tradition's meditation practices, particularly Om meditation and saguna-nirguna contemplation, provide experiential access to awareness transcending spatiotemporal limitations. Comparative analysis reveals strong alignment with Shankara's Advaita system while maintaining greater emphasis on practical synthesis of multiple yoga paths. Unlike Dvaita Vedanta's realistic space-time within God's creation or Vishishtadvaita's qualified non-dualism, Sivananda maintains strict non-dualism where space-time lacks ultimate reality. The tradition's accessible presentation through "Serve, Love, Give, Purify, Meditate, Realize" framework demonstrates practical spirituality grounded in sophisticated metaphysical understanding of spatiotemporal manifestation's derivative nature.

*** 1.19.153 Bikram Yoga Response

Bikram Yoga, systematized by Bikram Choudhury (1946-) through standardized hot yoga methodology, implicitly treats space and time as practical parameters for physical practice rather than subjects of explicit philosophical inquiry, though underlying Vedantic assumptions position them as empirical frameworks within consciousness rather than independent absolutes. The tradition developed during the 1970s following Choudhury's training under Bishnu Ghosh, emphasizing therapeutic applications and standardized sequences performed in heated environments. Key systematization occurred through the copyrighted 26-posture sequence and "Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class" (2000), which focus primarily on physical methodology rather than metaphysical exposition. The tradition's philosophical framework, though less explicitly articulated than classical systems, employs terminology including prana-vayu (vital energy), sukshma-sharira (subtle body), and dhyana (meditation), implicitly suggesting space-time's dependence on consciousness through practices affecting subtle energy. Bikram Yoga's emphasis on precise spatial alignment and temporal sequencing paradoxically demonstrates both practical acknowledgment of spatiotemporal parameters and underlying assumptions about their manipulability through consciousness. The heated room environment represents controlled spatial conditions affecting temporal experience of practice, implying space-time's dependence on experiential conditions. Drawing upon broader yoga philosophy without extensive textual engagement, the tradition inherits Vedantic assumptions about maya and phenomenal appearance while focusing on pragmatic health outcomes. Internal variations exist between practitioners emphasizing physical fitness versus spiritual development, with the former treating space-time more mechanistically and the latter maintaining consciousness-primacy. Counter-arguments from purely materialist exercise science are implicitly addressed through reported transformative experiences transcending ordinary physical training. Contemporary applications engage sports medicine and thermal physiology, with Bikram Yoga interpreting body-mind transformation as validating yogic principles about consciousness affecting physical reality. The tradition's standardized sequence provides experimental consistency for investigating spatiotemporal experience under controlled conditions. Comparative analysis reveals less explicit metaphysical development than classical Advaita or Samkhya systems, focusing instead on accessible physical methodology. Unlike Iyengar's detailed alignment philosophy or Ashtanga's vinyasa progression theory, Bikram emphasizes therapeutic heat and standardization. The tradition's global expansion through teacher training demonstrates practical dissemination of yogic methodology with implicit rather than explicit philosophical frameworks regarding space-time's ontological status, prioritizing experiential transformation over theoretical systematization.

*** 1.19.154 Iyengar Yoga Response

Iyengar Yoga, developed by B.K.S. Iyengar (1918-2014), understands space and time as experiential dimensions explored through precise asana alignment and pranayama timing, ultimately subordinate to consciousness (purusha) while serving as essential frameworks for spiritual practice within embodied existence. The tradition evolved through Iyengar's intensive practice and teaching from the 1930s through 2014, systematizing unprecedented precision in postural alignment. Foundational texts include "Light on Yoga" (1966), "Light on Pranayama" (1981), and "Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" (1993), which articulate sophisticated understanding of spatial-temporal dimensions in yogic practice. Iyengar's philosophical framework, rooted in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, employs technical terminology including desha-bandha (spatial binding), kala-krama (temporal sequence), and citta-vritti (mental modifications), arguing that space-time provides necessary structure for consciousness evolution while remaining distinct from eternal purusha. The tradition's innovative use of props (belts, blocks, blankets) demonstrates practical exploration of how spatial relationships affect consciousness, implying space's dependence on awareness for meaning. Following Yoga Sutras 3.52-53 on kshana-pratiyogi (succession of moments) and krama (sequence), Iyengar emphasizes temporal progression in practice while maintaining awareness of timeless witness consciousness. Internal variations exist between practitioners emphasizing therapeutic applications versus spiritual transformation, though both recognize spatiotemporal parameters' subordination to consciousness. Counter-arguments from materialist positions treating space-time as fundamental are addressed through experiential evidence from advanced practitioners reporting dissolution of ordinary spatial-temporal boundaries in meditation. Contemporary applications engage biomechanics and neuroscience, with Iyengar Yoga interpreting body-awareness research as validating yogic insights about consciousness organizing spatial experience. The tradition's detailed alignment principles provide systematic methodology for investigating how consciousness structures spatial perception through embodied practice. Comparative analysis reveals unique emphasis on precision and therapeutic application while maintaining classical Samkhya-Yoga dualism between purusha and prakriti. Unlike Advaita's maya doctrine or Kashmir Shaivism's consciousness monism, Iyengar maintains Samkhya's realistic prakriti that includes space-time elements while emphasizing purusha's transcendence. The tradition's global influence through certification programs demonstrates how practical methodology can embody sophisticated philosophical understanding of spatiotemporal dimensions as real but subordinate frameworks for consciousness evolution rather than independent absolutes.

*** 1.19.155 Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga Response

Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, systematized by K. Pattabhi Jois (1915-2009), approaches space and time as rhythmic parameters within consciousness-oriented practice, viewing them as necessary frameworks for the vinyasa (breath-movement synchronization) system while ultimately subordinate to the eternal witness (drashta) described in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. The tradition developed through Jois's training under Krishnamacharya (1930s-1940s) and subsequent teaching in Mysore, emphasizing dynamic sequencing and internal purification. Key systematization appears in "Yoga Mala" (1962) and the six-series structure, which articulate understanding of temporal progression (krama) and spatial flow (vinyasa) as vehicles for consciousness transformation. The philosophical framework employs technical terminology including tristhana (three-place attention: posture, breath, gaze), vinyasa-krama (progressive sequence), and antara-bahya-kumbhaka (internal-external breath retention), suggesting space-time's organization through consciousness rather than independent existence. Ashtanga's emphasis on counted breath (vinyasa count) and prescribed drishti (gaze points) demonstrates practical exploration of how consciousness structures temporal succession and spatial orientation. Following Yoga Sutras 1.2's definition of yoga as "chitta-vritti-nirodha" (cessation of mental modifications), the tradition views spatiotemporal experience as vritti-based phenomena transcended through practice rather than fundamental reality. Internal variations exist between traditional Mysore-style practitioners and led-class approaches, though both maintain the underlying Samkhya-Yoga philosophy of purusha-prakriti distinction. Counter-arguments from materialist positions are addressed through reported experiences of time dilation and spatial awareness expansion during intensive practice. Contemporary applications engage flow psychology and neuroscience research on meditation, with Ashtanga practitioners interpreting findings on altered time perception as validating yogic principles. The tradition's demanding physical regimen provides experimental context for investigating consciousness's relationship to embodied spatiotemporal experience. Comparative analysis reveals alignment with classical Samkhya-Yoga dualism while emphasizing dynamic practice over static postures, contrasting with Iyengar's precision or Bikram's standardization. Unlike Advaita's illusionism regarding space-time or Tantra's consciousness monism, Ashtanga maintains Samkhya's realistic prakriti including spatiotemporal dimensions while emphasizing purusha's transcendence. The tradition's global dissemination through authorized teachers demonstrates how rigorous physical practice can embody sophisticated philosophical understanding of space-time as real but derivative frameworks within consciousness-oriented transformation.

*** 1.19.156 Kundalini Yoga (Yogi Bhajan) Response

Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan (1929-2004), maintains that space and time are projections of consciousness (shuniya) organized through vibrational frequencies (naad) and geometric patterns (yantra), ultimately subordinate to infinite consciousness while serving as necessary structures for kundalini awakening and human evolution. The tradition crystallized during Bhajan's Western teaching period (1969-2004), synthesizing tantric philosophy, Sikh spirituality, and accessible methodology. Foundational teachings appear in "The Aquarian Teacher" training manual (2003) and extensive lecture compilations, articulating understanding of spatiotemporal manifestation through sound current (shabd) and energy geometry. The philosophical framework employs technical terminology including akasha-tattva (ether element), dasam duar (tenth gate transcending space-time), and anhad shabad (unstruck sound), arguing that space emerges through vibrational condensation and time through cyclic patterns of consciousness. Kundalini Yoga's emphasis on mantra (sound formulas) and mudra (energetic seals) demonstrates practical methodology for manipulating spatiotemporal experience through consciousness technology. The tradition distinguishes between finite mind operating within space-time and infinite mind (shuniya) transcending spatiotemporal limitations, accessible through meditation and kundalini activation. Drawing upon tantric cosmology while incorporating Sikh metaphysics, particularly the Mul Mantra's description of timeless reality (akal moorat), Bhajan's teachings position temporal cycles within eternal consciousness. Internal variations exist between practitioners emphasizing physical kriyas versus meditative practices, though both acknowledge space-time's dependence on consciousness. Counter-arguments from materialist neuroscience are addressed through experiential reports of altered states where spatiotemporal boundaries dissolve during intensive practice. Contemporary applications engage quantum physics and consciousness studies, with Kundalini Yoga interpreting non-locality and observer effects as validating yogic principles about consciousness generating spatial-temporal experience. The tradition's specific breathing techniques (pranayama) and their temporal patterns provide experimental protocols for investigating time perception's malleability. Comparative analysis reveals synthesis of Hindu tantra and Sikh monotheism, creating unique framework where space-time emerges from divine consciousness (Ek Ong Kar) while maintaining practical accessibility. Unlike classical Advaita's emphasis on negation or Samkhya's dualism, Kundalini Yoga emphasizes active transformation of consciousness through energy manipulation within spatiotemporal frameworks. The tradition's rapid Western expansion demonstrates appeal of accessible yet sophisticated understanding positioning space-time as real but derivative manifestations of infinite consciousness accessible through systematic practice.

*** 1.19.157 Kriya Yoga (Lahiri Mahasaya) Response

Kriya Yoga, revived by Lahiri Mahasaya (1828-1895) through initiated transmission, teaches that space and time are mental projections (bhrama) within infinite consciousness (Brahman), transcendable through specific pranayama techniques that reveal their dependence on awareness rather than independent existence. The tradition re-emerged through Lahiri's initiation by Mahavatar Babaji (1861) and subsequent teaching in Bengal, emphasizing esoteric practices over theoretical philosophy. Key teachings appear in Lahiri's commentaries on Bhagavad Gita and Yoga Sutras, plus disciples' compilations including "Purana Purusha" and "The Scriptural Commentaries of Yogiraj Lahiri Mahasaya," which articulate understanding of spatiotemporal transcendence through breath control. The philosophical framework employs technical terminology including kutastha-chaitanya (eternal consciousness at spiritual eye), pranava (Om vibration), and kevala-kumbhaka (spontaneous breathless state), arguing that suspension of breath reveals time's dependence on physiological processes and ultimately consciousness. Kriya Yoga's central practice of spinal pranayama with specific visualizations demonstrates practical methodology for experiencing consciousness independent of ordinary space-time through circulating prana in sushumna nadi. The tradition distinguishes between saguna Brahman manifesting as space-time and nirguna Brahman transcending all attributes, accessible through progressive kriyas. Drawing upon Bhagavad Gita 8.24-26's description of paths beyond time (kala) and Yoga Sutras 3.52-53 on discriminating awareness transcending temporal sequence, Lahiri emphasized direct experience over theoretical speculation. Internal variations exist between lineage branches (Yukteswar, Panchanan Bhattacharya, Pranabananda) with differing technical emphases, though all maintain consciousness-primacy over space-time. Counter-arguments from materialist positions are addressed through Lahiri's emphasis on empirical verification through practice rather than faith-based belief. Contemporary applications remain limited due to oral transmission requirements, though practitioners interpret modern physics as confirming yogic insights about observer-dependent reality. The tradition's secretive nature and initiation requirements preserve precision while limiting academic engagement. Comparative analysis reveals strong alignment with Advaita Vedanta's illusionism regarding space-time while emphasizing practical technique over philosophical discourse. Unlike devotional traditions or jnana-yoga's intellectual approach, Kriya emphasizes technical pranayama for directly experiencing spatiotemporal transcendence. The tradition's influence through Yogananda's dissemination demonstrates how esoteric practices can embody sophisticated understanding of space-time as consciousness-dependent phenomena accessible through systematic breath manipulation and energy control.

*** 1.19.158 Swami Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya) Response

Swami Dayananda Saraswati (1930-2015) of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam teaches that space (akasha) and time (kala) are neither independently existent nor ultimately real, functioning instead as nama-rupa (name-form) manifestations within Brahman, the non-dual consciousness that alone possesses absolute existence (sat). The tradition developed through Dayananda's systematic Vedanta teaching from the 1960s through 2015, emphasizing precise Sanskrit analysis and traditional Advaita methodology. Foundational works include "The Teaching of the Bhagavad Gita" (2006), extensive Upanishad commentaries, and recorded teaching series, which articulate rigorous understanding of spatiotemporal appearance within non-dual reality. Dayananda's philosophical framework employs technical terminology including vivarta (apparent transformation), anirvachaniya-khyati (indefinable appearance), and adhyaropa-apavada (superimposition-rescission methodology), arguing that space-time represents mithya (dependent reality)—neither absolutely real (sat) like Brahman nor absolutely unreal (asat) like square circles. The tradition distinguishes between Brahman as limitless consciousness (aparicchinna chaitanya) and space-time as limiting adjuncts (upadhis) creating apparent boundaries. Following Taittiriya Upanishad 2.1's creation sequence where akasha emerges first from Brahman, and Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1-3's teaching that existence alone was "in the beginning," Dayananda argues temporal succession presupposes eternal witness rather than self-subsisting time. Internal methodological variations exist between intensive residential teaching (gurukulam) and public lecture formats, though philosophical positions remain consistent with traditional Advaita. Counter-arguments from scientific realism are addressed through Dayananda's sophisticated epistemological analysis distinguishing vyavaharika (empirical validity) from paramarthika (absolute truth), acknowledging physics' pragmatic success while denying ontological ultimacy. Contemporary applications engage relativity and quantum mechanics, interpreting spacetime relativity and observer-dependency as confirming Vedantic insights about consciousness-primacy. The tradition's emphasis on Paninian grammar and precise Sanskrit terminology provides methodological rigor for analyzing space-time concepts in original texts. Comparative analysis reveals strict adherence to Shankara's Advaita system while emphasizing clarity and accessibility in teaching methodology. Unlike neo-Vedanta's synthetic approaches or devotional traditions' theistic frameworks, Arsha Vidya maintains classical non-dualism where space-time lacks independent existence, appearing only through superimposition on Brahman. The tradition's global teaching centers demonstrate continued relevance of traditional Advaita methodology for understanding spatiotemporal manifestation as dependent appearance within infinite consciousness.

*** 1.19.159 Yoga Vedanta Forest Academy Response

The Yoga Vedanta Forest Academy, founded by Swami Sivananda's disciple Swami Vishnudevananda (1927-1993), teaches that space and time are phenomenal modifications (parinamavada) within cosmic consciousness, serving practical roles in spiritual evolution while lacking ultimate reality independent of Brahman. The tradition developed through Vishnudevananda's establishment of international centers from 1957 onward, synthesizing classical Vedanta with systematic yoga methodology. Foundational texts include "The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga" (1960) and "Meditation and Mantras" (1978), which articulate understanding of spatiotemporal frameworks within consciousness-based cosmology. The philosophical framework employs technical terminology including panchikarana (five-fold elemental combination), avidya-shakti (power of ignorance), and turiya (fourth state transcending space-time), arguing that spatial extension and temporal succession arise through progressive manifestation from undifferentiated awareness. The tradition's emphasis on five principles (proper exercise, breathing, relaxation, diet, meditation) demonstrates practical methodology acknowledging spatiotemporal parameters while maintaining their subordination to consciousness. Drawing upon Mandukya Upanishad's analysis of consciousness states and Vivekachudamani's description of maya's space-time projections, the Academy teaches systematic progression from gross to subtle understanding. Internal variations exist between centers emphasizing different yoga paths (karma, bhakti, jnana, raja), though all maintain Advaitic foundations regarding space-time's derivative nature. Counter-arguments from materialist scientism are addressed through integrative approach acknowledging empirical science's domain while asserting its epistemological limitations regarding ultimate reality. Contemporary applications engage mind-body medicine and consciousness research, with the Academy interpreting psychosomatic phenomena as validating yoga's understanding of consciousness organizing physical-temporal experience. The tradition's teacher training programs provide systematic frameworks for understanding space-time through experiential practice rather than purely intellectual analysis. Comparative analysis reveals strong continuity with Sivananda's synthetic approach while emphasizing international accessibility and practical application. Unlike purely intellectual Advaita or devotional Vaishnavism, the Forest Academy emphasizes balanced synthesis where space-time serves practical purposes in spiritual methodology while remaining ultimately illusory. The tradition's "unity in diversity" motto acknowledges different philosophical frameworks while maintaining core Vedantic position on space-time's dependence on Brahman, demonstrating inclusive approach to metaphysical questions grounded in non-dual consciousness primacy accessible through integrated yoga practice.

*** 1.19.160 Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute Response

Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute, founded by Swami Kuvalayananda (1883-1966), approaches space and time through unique synthesis of traditional yoga philosophy and scientific methodology, viewing them as real parameters for empirical investigation while maintaining underlying Vedantic understanding of their ultimate dependence on consciousness. The tradition developed through Kuvalayananda's pioneering work from 1924 onward, establishing scientific yoga research alongside philosophical teaching. Foundational contributions include "Pranayama" (1931), the journal "Yoga Mimamsa" (1924-present), and extensive research publications, which articulate sophisticated understanding balancing empirical rigor with metaphysical depth. The Institute's philosophical framework employs technical terminology including prakriti-vikara (modifications of nature), guna-parinama (transformation of qualities), and kaivalya (absolute independence), arguing that space-time represents real manifestation of prakriti while purusha (consciousness) remains eternally independent of spatiotemporal constraints. Kaivalyadhama's emphasis on physiological research, including pioneering X-ray studies of yogic postures and respiratory measurements, demonstrates practical engagement with space-time as measurable reality while maintaining philosophical understanding of consciousness transcendence. The tradition distinguishes between yogic practice within spatiotemporal parameters and meditative realization of timeless awareness, integrating Samkhya-Yoga philosophy with empirical methodology. Following Yoga Sutras' framework while emphasizing scientific validation, particularly YS 3.13's teaching on transformation of properties (dharma-lakshana-avastha-parinama), the Institute argues for both empirical reality and ultimate transcendence of space-time. Internal variations exist between research scientists and traditional teachers, creating productive dialogue between empirical and contemplative approaches. Counter-arguments from either pure materialism or pure idealism are addressed through Kaivalyadhama's integrative methodology acknowledging both empirical validity and metaphysical depth. Contemporary applications extensively engage modern science, with the Institute pioneering yoga therapy research and publishing peer-reviewed studies on spatiotemporal aspects of consciousness and physiology. The tradition's research facilities provide unique platforms for investigating space-time through both objective measurement and subjective experience. Comparative analysis reveals distinctive integration of scientific methodology with traditional philosophy, unlike purely traditional gurukulas or purely secular yoga studios. The Institute maintains Samkhya-Yoga dualism between purusha and prakriti while emphasizing empirical investigation of prakriti's spatiotemporal manifestations. Unlike Advaita's emphasis on maya or devotional traditions' theistic frameworks, Kaivalyadhama validates scientific realism regarding space-time while maintaining philosophical understanding of consciousness independence, demonstrating how tradition and modernity can productively engage metaphysical questions.

*** 1.19.161 Parmarth Niketan Response

Parmarth Niketan, Rishikesh's largest ashram under Swami Chidanand Saraswati's leadership (1952-), teaches that space and time are divine manifestations (leela) serving spiritual evolution while ultimately resting within infinite Brahman, functioning as real frameworks for seva (service) and sadhana (practice) without independent existence apart from consciousness. The tradition developed through its establishment in 1942 and Swami Chidanand's leadership from 1986, emphasizing environmental spirituality and interfaith dialogue alongside traditional Vedanta. Key teachings appear through satsangs, the International Yoga Festival, and publications including "Drops of Nectar" and environmental initiatives, which articulate understanding of spatiotemporal creation as sacred manifestation. The philosophical framework employs technical terminology including srishti (creation), sthiti (maintenance), and laya (dissolution), arguing that space-time undergoes cosmic cycles within eternal Brahman while serving as venues for karma-yoga and spiritual growth. Parmarth's emphasis on Ganga aarti ceremony demonstrates practical engagement with sacred space-time, where particular locations and moments become charged with spiritual significance while remaining ultimately within non-dual consciousness. The tradition distinguishes between conventional reality where space-time functions practically and ultimate reality (paramarthika) where only Brahman exists. Drawing upon Bhagavad Gita 8.17-19's teaching on cosmic day-night cycles and creation's repeated manifestation-dissolution, along with Upanishadic wisdom, Parmarth emphasizes both reverence for creation and recognition of its temporal nature. Internal variations exist between visitors seeking retreat experiences and resident renunciates pursuing intensive sadhana, though both participate in frameworks acknowledging space-time's spiritual significance and ultimate dependence on Brahman. Counter-arguments from secular environmentalism are addressed through integrating ecological activism with spiritual understanding of nature's sacred character. Contemporary applications extensively engage environmental issues, with Parmarth interpreting climate change and ecological degradation as requiring both practical action within space-time and spiritual recognition of creation's divine nature. The tradition's interfaith initiatives demonstrate openness while maintaining Vedantic foundations regarding consciousness-primacy. Comparative analysis reveals synthesis of practical environmental engagement with traditional Advaita, unlike purely contemplative approaches or purely activist movements. While maintaining non-dual metaphysics where space-time lacks independent existence, Parmarth emphasizes seva within spatiotemporal frameworks as authentic spiritual practice. The tradition's Global Interfaith WASH Alliance demonstrates how Vedantic understanding of space-time as Brahman's manifestation motivates practical service addressing suffering within phenomenal reality, integrating metaphysical insight with compassionate action.

*** 1.19.162 Divine Life Trust Response

The Divine Life Trust, continuing Swami Sivananda Saraswati's legacy through the Divine Life Society headquarters in Rishikesh, maintains that space and time are maya's projections lacking independent existence, serving as training grounds for spiritual evolution while remaining ultimately illusory modifications superimposed upon infinite Brahman. The tradition perpetuates Sivananda's teachings (1887-1963) through institutional preservation, emphasizing integral yoga and universal spirituality. Foundational teachings derive from Sivananda's extensive writings including "All About Hinduism" (1947), "Essence of the Principal Upanishads" (1952), and the comprehensive "Bliss Divine," which articulate systematic Advaita Vedanta positions on spatiotemporal appearance. The Trust's philosophical framework employs technical terminology including kala-traya (three times: past, present, future), desha-kala-vastu (space-time-object triad), and kala-atita (time-transcendent), arguing that temporal succession and spatial extension represent consciousness viewed through ignorance (avidya). The tradition's emphasis on multiple yoga paths (karma, bhakti, jnana, raja) demonstrates practical methodology acknowledging spatiotemporal frameworks' utility while maintaining their ultimate unreality. Drawing upon Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.8.8's teaching about the imperishable supporting space itself, and Bhagavad Gita 2.16's assertion that the unreal has no being, the Trust argues consciousness alone possesses true existence while space-time represents dependent appearance. Internal variations exist between scholars emphasizing jnana-yoga and practitioners emphasizing devotional approaches, though both maintain Advaitic foundations. Counter-arguments from scientific materialism are addressed through Sivananda's integrative spirit acknowledging empirical science's validity within its domain while asserting Vedanta's superiority for ultimate questions. Contemporary applications engage global spirituality movements, with the Trust interpreting modern physics as increasingly confirming yogic insights about reality's consciousness-basis. The tradition's publishing house disseminates systematic teachings making Advaita accessible while maintaining philosophical rigor. Comparative analysis reveals continuation of classical Shankaran Advaita with emphasis on practical accessibility and universal application. Unlike sectarian approaches or purely scholarly Vedanta, the Trust emphasizes lived spirituality where understanding space-time's illusory nature informs ethical action and spiritual practice. The tradition's medical services, publications, and spiritual programs demonstrate integration of metaphysical understanding with compassionate service within phenomenal space-time, recognizing both its practical reality and ultimate dependence on Brahman. The Trust's global reach through translations and correspondence courses demonstrates enduring relevance of traditional Advaita for understanding spatiotemporal manifestation as consciousness-dependent appearance.

*** 1.19.163 Sadhguru (Isha Foundation) Response

Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev through Isha Foundation teaches that space and time are not independent realities but dimensions of human perception organized by consciousness, with space representing the fundamental matrix for existence and time arising from memory and psychological projection rather than objective flow. The tradition developed through Sadhguru's teaching from the 1980s onward, emphasizing experiential spirituality and yogic practices. Key articulations appear in "Inner Engineering" (2016), "Mystic's Musings" (2003), and extensive discourse compilations, which present understanding of spatiotemporal experience as perceptual construction. The philosophical framework employs terminology including chit-akasha (consciousness space), Shiva-Shakti dynamics, and aliveness (fundamental quality transcending space-time), arguing that what humans experience as time represents psychological accumulation while space represents the pregnant nothing (shunya) from which all manifestation emerges. Sadhguru's emphasis on "Inner Engineering" practices demonstrates methodology for experiencing consciousness beyond ordinary spatiotemporal constraints through specific kriyas and meditations. The tradition distinguishes between psychological time (memory-based projection) and existential moment (timeless now), arguing only the latter possesses reality. Drawing eclectically from yogic traditions while avoiding extensive textual citations, Sadhguru emphasizes direct perception over scriptural authority, though underlying framework resonates with Kashmir Shaivism and tantric cosmology. Internal variations exist between participants seeking personal development and serious spiritual seekers, though teachings maintain consistent emphasis on experiential verification. Counter-arguments from neuroscientific materialism are engaged through Sadhguru's articulation of consciousness as fundamental rather than emergent, though with pragmatic acknowledgment of scientific methodology's value. Contemporary applications extensively engage modern science, with Sadhguru interpreting quantum physics, particularly wave-particle duality and observer effects, as validating yogic understanding of reality's malleability through consciousness. The tradition's emphasis on ecological initiatives (Rally for Rivers, Save Soil) demonstrates practical engagement with spatial-environmental realities while maintaining their ultimate dependence on consciousness. Comparative analysis reveals synthesis of traditional yoga philosophy with contemporary language accessible to modern audiences, unlike purely traditional Sanskrit-based teaching or purely secular mindfulness. The Foundation's global programs demonstrate appeal of understanding space-time as perceptual dimensions rather than independent realities. Unlike classical Samkhya's dualism or Advaita's textual methodology, Sadhguru emphasizes direct experience and practical technology for transcending ordinary spatiotemporal perception, presenting ancient insights through contemporary frameworks that position space as fundamental matrix and time as psychological construct within consciousness.

*** 1.19.164 Jaggi Vasudev Tradition Response

The Jaggi Vasudev tradition (Sadhguru's teaching lineage) maintains that space and time do not exist independently but rather represent dimensions of human perception created by consciousness, with space forming the fundamental existential matrix while time emerges from memory and anticipation rather than possessing objective reality. This understanding developed through Sadhguru's mystical experiences and subsequent teaching methodology from the 1990s forward, emphasizing empirical verification through yogic practice. Core teachings appear through "Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga" (2017), "Karma: A Yogi's Guide" (2021), and the comprehensive "Inner Engineering" program, articulating sophisticated understanding of spatiotemporal experience as consciousness-generated phenomena. The philosophical framework employs technical vocabulary including bhuta-akasha (elemental space), chit-akasha (consciousness space), and shoonya (emptiness), arguing that physical space represents compressed possibility while time represents mental fabrication from karmic memory (storage of past impressions). The tradition's Bhava Spandana program demonstrates practical methodology for experiencing timelessness through intense kriya practices dissolving ordinary temporal perception. Sadhguru distinguishes between existential reality occurring only in present moment and psychological reality constructed through temporal projection, arguing that liberation involves freeing oneself from time-binding through intense presence. Drawing upon classical yoga and tantra while presenting through contemporary language, the tradition resonates with Abhinavagupta's spanda (vibration) theory and Vijnanabhairava's direct methods, though without extensive textual commentary. Internal diversity exists between online course participants and intensive program attendees, with deeper teachings emphasizing consciousness-primacy more explicitly. Counter-arguments from materialist neuroscience are addressed through Sadhguru's challenge to explain consciousness emergence from matter, proposing instead consciousness as fundamental reality generating spatiotemporal experience. Contemporary engagement with physics includes dialogue with quantum mechanics and cosmology, interpreting scientific findings about spacetime relativity and quantum indeterminacy as approaching yogic insights about reality's consciousness-dependence. The tradition's consecrated spaces (Dhyanalinga, Adiyogi statue) demonstrate practical work with spatial energetics while maintaining philosophical understanding of space's non-independence. Comparative analysis reveals creative synthesis of classical Indian philosophy with contemporary expression, similar to Kashmir Shaivism's emphasis on recognition (pratyabhijna) while more accessible than traditional Sanskrit exposition. Unlike Advaita's textual methodology or devotional traditions' theistic frameworks, this tradition emphasizes direct experiential access to consciousness transcending space-time through specific yogic technologies transmitted systematically.

*** 1.19.165 Art of Living International Response

Art of Living International, founded by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar (1956-), teaches that space and time are relative dimensions within consciousness rather than absolute realities, serving as frameworks for human experience while ultimately dependent on awareness that transcends spatiotemporal limitations. The tradition developed through Ravi Shankar's teaching from 1981 onward, emphasizing breathing techniques and meditation accessible across cultural boundaries. Foundational teachings appear through "Celebrating Silence" (1995), "God Loves Fun" (1996), and the Sudarshan Kriya technique, which provide frameworks understanding spatiotemporal transcendence through systematic practice. The philosophical framework employs terminology including Shiva-Shakti dynamics, layers of existence (koshas), and the present moment (sankalpa), arguing that space represents the field of possibilities while time represents the flow of consciousness through experience, both dependent on awareness. Art of Living's emphasis on breath-based practices demonstrates methodology for experiencing consciousness beyond ordinary space-time constraints through rhythmic pranayama patterns affecting temporal perception. The tradition distinguishes between absolute reality (Brahman) and relative reality where space-time function practically, accessible through progressive meditation stages. Drawing upon Advaita Vedanta, Yoga Sutras, and Bhagavad Gita while emphasizing universal applicability, Ravi Shankar teaches that the present moment alone truly exists, with past-future representing mental constructs within timeless awareness. Internal variations exist between casual course participants and serious spiritual practitioners, though core teachings maintain consciousness-primacy. Counter-arguments from materialist positions are addressed through emphasis on direct experience rather than dogmatic assertion, inviting empirical verification through practice. Contemporary applications extensively engage interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution, with Art of Living interpreting stress research and neuroplasticity findings as validating yogic principles about consciousness affecting physiological-temporal experience. The tradition's global humanitarian work demonstrates practical engagement within spatiotemporal frameworks while maintaining philosophical understanding of their dependence on consciousness. Comparative analysis reveals accessible synthesis of traditional Vedanta with contemporary presentation, similar to Transcendental Meditation's universal approach while maintaining more explicit connection to Indian sources. Unlike traditions emphasizing renunciation or intensive physical practice, Art of Living emphasizes joyful engagement where understanding space-time's relativity informs balanced living rather than world-rejection. The tradition's presence in over 150 countries demonstrates appeal of understanding that honors spatiotemporal reality's practical importance while recognizing ultimate dependence on consciousness, integrating ancient wisdom with contemporary needs through systematic breathing and meditation practices.
