Karma Across Philosophical Traditions (200 words)

Karma operates through radically different mechanisms across philosophical traditions, revealing fundamental disagreements about causation, divine involvement, and the nature of liberation.

Buddhist traditions emphasize intentional action (cetana) as karma's essence within dependent origination. Theravada provides teachings about cause and effect with pacifying meditations to avoid afflictive emotions. Mahayana extends this motivation toward freeing all beings from suffering through applying antidotes to mental poisons. Vajrayana/Tibetan Buddhism works directly with afflictive emotions, transforming their poisonous aspect into pure wisdom. All Buddhist schools ground karma in intention rather than mere physical action.

Hindu Vedanta traditions agree karma cannot function independently but requires divine dispensation. Advaita's Adi Sankara argues that karmic actions cannot produce results independently—a supreme being (Ishvara) must administer consequences, though karma ultimately belongs to Maya's illusory realm. Vishishtadvaita's Ramanuja attributes all suffering to accumulated evil karma while maintaining God remains unstained, with Brahman arranging creation's diversity according to individual karmic records. Dvaita acknowledges karma as the soul's driving force in material existence, emphasizing righteous action alongside devotion.

Jainism presents the most distinctive conception: karma consists of subtle material particles (pudgala) pervading the universe. These imperceptible atomic substances physically adhere to souls through actions, creating bondage that requires rigorous ascetic practice for removal. This materialist view, possibly dating to 8th-9th century BCE, predates modern atomic theory by millennia.
