*** 1.16.136 MANICHAEISM Response

Do we have free will? Manichaeism presents a profound dualistic framework where human agency exists within the cosmic struggle between Light and Darkness. The question touches upon our most fundamental spiritual condition—souls of Light imprisoned in material bodies created by forces of Darkness.

According to Mani's revelations, we possess genuine but constrained freedom. Our souls originate from the Kingdom of Light, bearing inherent divine nature, yet find themselves trapped in matter through the primordial conflict. This imprisonment limits but doesn't eliminate choice. We retain capacity to recognize our true origin and choose the path of liberation through gnosis. The historical Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus each demonstrated this possibility, showing that enlightenment remains accessible despite material entanglement.

Free will manifests primarily in our response to saving knowledge. When presented with Manichaean teachings, we can accept or reject them. This choice determines whether we participate actively in separating Light from Darkness within ourselves through the "Three Seals"—purity of mouth, hands, and heart. The Elect demonstrate maximum exercise of freedom by renouncing worldly attachments, while Hearers choose gradual purification through supporting the Elect and following ethical precepts.

However, our freedom operates asymmetrically. The forces of Darkness—associated with matter, ignorance, and demonic powers—actively work to keep souls imprisoned. Concupiscence, forgetfulness of divine origin, and material desires represent real constraints on volition. We cannot simply will ourselves free without divine assistance and revealed knowledge.

Practically, Manichaean communities historically organized around this understanding. The elaborate church hierarchy, with Teachers, Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, existed to transmit saving knowledge that enables authentic choice. Ritual practices like the Bema festival commemorated Mani's passion and reminded believers of their capacity to choose Light over Darkness.

The cosmological dimension matters profoundly. We participate in universal redemption—each act of choosing Light actively contributes to gathering scattered divine particles back to their source. This cosmic significance elevates individual choices beyond mere personal consequence.

Critics argued Manichaeism made evil substantial and diminished divine sovereignty, but adherents maintained that recognizing real opposition between Light and Darkness actually honors human dignity. We're not puppets of an omnipotent deity but warriors whose choices matter in cosmic liberation.

Ultimately, Manichaean soteriology affirms that while circumstance constrains us, knowledge liberates. We possess sufficient freedom to recognize truth, embrace discipline, and gradually separate ourselves from Darkness. The question isn't whether we can choose, but whether we'll choose wisely when confronted with salvific knowledge.

*** 1.16.137 MANDAEISM Response

Do we have free will? Mandaeism, the ancient Gnostic tradition of the Mandaeans or "knowers," addresses human agency through its distinctive cosmology centered on the World of Light and reverence for the living waters. Our freedom exists as a precious but precarious gift requiring constant vigilance and ritual maintenance.

According to the Ginza Rabba, our sacred texts, souls descend from the World of Light (Alma d-Nhura) into the physical realm governed by planetary archons and ruled by Ruha, the spirit of chaos and matter. This descent isn't punishment but a test. We retain essential freedom to remember our celestial origin and choose return to Light, but earthly existence subjects us to powerful forces of forgetfulness and materiality.

Free will manifests most authentically in our relationship with ritual purity. The masbuta (baptism) performed in flowing "living water" represents more than ceremonial observance—it's a free choice to align with Light against chaos. Each Sunday, Mandaeans can choose to undergo this renewal, demonstrating that freedom requires repeated reaffirmation, not merely one-time decision. This weekly practice acknowledges that earthly forces constantly compromise our clarity and autonomy.

The Mandaean priesthood, maintaining an unbroken lineage since ancient times, serves as custodians of knowledge that enables authentic freedom. Without understanding the secret prayers, cosmological realities, and ritual requirements preserved by tarmidas (priests), ordinary individuals cannot exercise fully informed choice. This epistemological dimension distinguishes Mandaean thought—freedom depends on knowledge, and knowledge requires transmission through legitimate succession.

However, we face genuine constraints. The planets (associated with Jewish and Christian traditions in our polemical literature) exert astrological influence limiting terrestrial freedom. Ruha and her offspring actively seek to keep souls ignorant of their Light-origin. Death itself represents a dangerous transition where souls must navigate a perilous journey through the "watchhouses" or matartas, facing judgment and obstacles.

Practically, Mandaean communities in Iraq, Iran, and diaspora organize life around maintaining conditions for free choice. Endogamy, dietary restrictions, and settlement near flowing rivers aren't arbitrary rules but necessary conditions preserving the knowledge-transmission enabling authentic volition. When Saddam Hussein's regime and later ISIS persecution disrupted these patterns, it threatened not just physical survival but the very possibility of exercising informed spiritual choice.

The historical persistence of Mandaeism despite centuries of persecution demonstrates the community's collective choice to maintain identity and practice. This communal dimension reveals that individual freedom exists within a web of relationships with previous generations, contemporary co-religionists, and future descendants.

Ultimately, Mandaean teaching affirms conditional freedom—we can choose Light over Darkness, purity over pollution, knowledge over ignorance, but only by actively maintaining the ritual, ethical, and communal conditions that preserve clear vision and authentic autonomy.

*** 1.16.138 YAZIDISM Response

Do we have free will? Yazidism, the ancient Kurdish tradition centered on Tawûsê Melek (the Peacock Angel), offers a distinctive perspective emerging from our unique cosmology and the doctrine of progressive revelation through seven divine angels. Our understanding of human agency reflects both the sovereignty of the supreme God and the delegated authority through which creation operates.

According to Yazidi sacred tradition transmitted orally through qewls (sacred hymns) and maintained by our hereditary caste system, God created Tawûsê Melek first among seven angels and entrusted him with governing the world. This delegation establishes a crucial framework: if divine authority itself can be shared, human freedom becomes conceivable within the cosmic hierarchy. We aren't directly determined by the supreme God but participate in an ordered creation where various levels of agency interact.

The Yazidi account of Tawûsê Melek's refusal to bow to Adam inverts the Islamic narrative of Iblis's fall. When God commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Tawûsê Melek refused, asserting loyalty to God alone. Rather than punishment, this demonstrated understanding of true divine unity. This foundational narrative suggests that authentic freedom involves discerning genuine obligation from apparent command—a sophisticated doctrine of moral autonomy requiring wisdom to navigate competing directives.

We understand free will through our lived experience of caste obligation and individual choice. Born into one of three castes—sheikhs, pirs, or murids—each Yazidi inherits specific ritual responsibilities and social positions. This hereditary structure might appear deterministic, yet within each station, individuals choose how faithfully to fulfill duties, how deeply to study tradition, and how to apply inherited wisdom to novel circumstances.

The concept of metempsychosis (reincarnation) in Yazidi thought adds temporal depth to freedom. Our choices across multiple lifetimes shape spiritual development, with souls potentially progressing toward greater enlightenment or regressing through moral failure. This extended timeframe transforms isolated decisions into patterns with enduring consequences, elevating the significance of each choice.

Practically, Yazidi communities have exercised collective freedom through remarkable persistence. Surviving seventy-four documented genocides ("firmans") required continuous choice to maintain identity despite overwhelming pressure to convert. The 2014 Sinjar genocide by ISIS, where thousands chose death rather than apostasy, demonstrated that even under extreme duress, Yazidis affirm their capacity and determination to choose.

Our sacred sites—Lalish temple, the tomb of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir, and mountain shrines—serve as anchors for communal identity, places where individual choices connect with ancestral wisdom and future generations. Pilgrimage to these sites represents voluntary reaffirmation of tradition, not compulsion.

The Yazidi emphasis on endogamy and avoiding proselytization creates a closed community, yet this closure itself reflects collective choice about identity preservation. Within these boundaries, individuals navigate relationships, interpret obligations, and apply tradition to contemporary challenges.

*** 1.16.139 DRUZE Response

Do we have free will? The Druze faith, an esoteric tradition emerging from Ismaili Islam in eleventh-century Egypt, addresses human agency through the doctrine of Tawhid (divine unity) and the unique system of spiritual hierarchy distinguishing between the initiated ('uqqal) and uninitiated (juhhal). Our understanding balances divine sovereignty with human responsibility in ways that honor both transcendence and accountability.

According to Druze metaphysics, outlined in the Epistles of Wisdom (Rasa'il al-Hikma) revealed through Hamza ibn Ali, God's absolute unity transcends all attributes and determinations. This radical transcendence means God doesn't directly interfere in temporal events through moment-by-moment determination. Instead, creation operates through emanated cosmic principles—the Universal Mind, Universal Soul, and Word—establishing a structured cosmos within which human freedom functions.

The Druze doctrine of reincarnation (taqammus) fundamentally shapes our understanding of free will. Souls transmigrate immediately upon death into new bodies, carrying karmic consequences of previous choices. This cycle continues until souls achieve sufficient purification to escape corporeal existence entirely. Each lifetime presents renewed opportunities for moral development, with choices accumulating significance across multiple incarnations. Far from diminishing freedom, this framework intensifies it—every decision contributes to one's eternal trajectory.

Our community divides into 'uqqal (initiated knowers) who have chosen to study esoteric teachings and adopt strict ethical discipline, and juhhal (uninitiated) who participate in communal identity without accessing full doctrine. This division reflects voluntary choice. One isn't born into initiation but must request it and demonstrate readiness. This demonstrates respect for individual agency—even within a closed religious community, individuals determine their level of engagement.

The Druze principle of taqiyya (permissible dissimulation) when facing persecution adds complexity to freedom. We may conceal true beliefs to preserve life and community, choosing outward conformity while maintaining inner conviction. This practice, employed during centuries of Ottoman rule and various conflicts in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, represents sophisticated understanding that freedom operates simultaneously at external and internal levels.

Practically, Druze communities organize around khalwa (prayer houses) where initiated members gather Thursday evenings. Attendance is voluntary, reflecting the principle that authentic spiritual practice requires free commitment, not compulsion. The communal meals and discussions following prayers create space for interpreting how timeless principles apply to contemporary situations—a process requiring human judgment and choice.

Historical Druze military prowess and political acumen in the Levant demonstrates communal exercise of strategic freedom. Alliances, tactical decisions, and resistance to various empires required collective deliberation and choice. The remarkable Druze survival through turbulent Middle Eastern history testifies to effective exercise of communal agency.

The emphasis on rational inquiry within Druze thought distinguishes it from deterministic schools. Our scholars engage philosophical texts from Greek, Islamic, and Gnostic sources, synthesizing insights through reasoned discourse—an inherently free activity requiring critical judgment.

*** 1.16.140 ALAWISM Response

Do we have free will? Alawism, the esoteric tradition historically centered in Syria's coastal mountains, approaches human agency through distinctive cosmology combining Islamic, Gnostic, and Neoplatonic elements. Our understanding emerges from secret teachings transmitted orally through initiation, revealed gradually to committed male members across multiple stages of spiritual development.

According to Alawite doctrine, preserved through the Book of Synthesis (Kitab al-Majmu') and other sacred texts accessible only to initiates, reality manifests through cycles of divine emanation and concealment. The divine essence manifests through a triad—the Meaning (ma'na), corresponding to Ali ibn Abi Talib; the Name (ism); and the Gate (bab). This trinitarian structure establishes a cosmology where divinity participates in temporal reality, creating genuine interaction rather than unilateral determination.

The Alawite teaching of metempsychosis (tanasukh) profoundly shapes our view of free will. Souls transmigrate through multiple human incarnations based on moral and spiritual achievement. Faithful Alawites may progress spiritually across lifetimes, while those who fail ethical standards or betray the community risk returning in diminished forms. Some interpretations suggest souls might even enter animal bodies as punishment. This doctrine makes choice consequential across an extended temporal horizon, intensifying rather than diminishing freedom's significance.

Our seven-stage initiation system for males demonstrates that spiritual knowledge—and therefore informed freedom—develops progressively. Young boys begin as "profane" (barrānī), gradually advancing through stages as they prove trustworthy and comprehend deeper teachings. Women participate in the community but traditionally don't undergo formal initiation, reflecting historical social structures. This hierarchical knowledge transmission suggests that authentic freedom requires preparation; not all choices are equally available at all stages of understanding.

The Alawite principle of concealment (taqiyya) operated for centuries when our community faced persecution from Sunni majorities and various rulers. We could outwardly conform to dominant Islamic practice while preserving esoteric teachings internally. This strategic flexibility represents sophisticated exercise of collective freedom—choosing survival and continuity over public testimony. Critics might see this as compromised freedom, but Alawites view it as wisdom, recognizing that meaningful choice sometimes requires strategic adaptation.

Practically, Alawite villages in the coastal mountains of Syria developed autonomous social structures where the community regulated internal affairs according to esoteric principles. Shaykhs provided spiritual guidance, adjudicated disputes, and maintained oral traditions. This local autonomy created space for communal self-determination even under various empires.

The twentieth-century transformation of Syrian Alawites from marginalized minority to political dominance under the Assad dynasty illustrates collective agency exercised through strategic choices. Alawite officers' decisions to join the Ba'ath Party, support Hafez al-Assad's rise, and maintain control through the regime demonstrate—however one evaluates these morally—significant exercise of communal freedom shaping national history.

*** 1.16.141 ALEVISM Response

Do we have free will? Alevism, the Anatolian tradition synthesizing Shia Islam, Sufism, and pre-Islamic Turkish shamanic elements, addresses human agency through the principle of "Four Doors, Forty Stations" (Dört Kapı Kırk Makam) outlining spiritual development. Our understanding emphasizes progressive realization of divine potential within humanity, balancing divine immanence with human responsibility.

According to Alevi teaching, transmitted through oral tradition, poetry (deyiş), and the guidance of spiritual leaders (dedes), the universe manifests divine creativity. The human being represents the culmination of creation, uniquely capable of conscious relationship with the divine. This exalted anthropology suggests inherent freedom—we're not merely creatures subjected to external decree but bearers of divine attributes capable of self-direction.

The spiritual path through Four Doors illustrates how freedom develops with understanding. The first door, Sharia (religious law), represents elementary obligations; the second, Tariqa (spiritual path), involves deeper mystical practice; the third, Marifet (gnosis), achieves direct knowledge; the fourth, Hakikat (reality), realizes ultimate truth. Progress through these stages isn't automatic but requires choice, effort, and grace. Each station within each door presents opportunities for advancement or stagnation based on individual response to teaching and practice.

Alevi cem ceremonies—communal gatherings featuring sacred music (semah), poetry, and ritual—create contexts where individual freedom operates within communal structure. Participation is voluntary, yet full participation requires ethical preparation. Before entering the sacred circle, participants must resolve conflicts with others, seek forgiveness, and purify intentions. This demonstrates that authentic freedom in Alevi thought involves relational harmony, not mere individual autonomy.

The Alevi emphasis on gender equality, with men and women participating together in cem without veiling or segregation, reflects philosophical commitment to human dignity transcending gender. Women's freedom to participate fully in spiritual life distinguishes Alevism from many Islamic traditions. This practice embodies belief that all humans possess equal capacity for spiritual realization and moral agency regardless of gender.

Historical Alevi experience in Ottoman and Republican Turkey shaped understanding of freedom under constraint. Facing persecution from Sunni orthodoxy, Alevis practiced takiya (concealment), outwardly conforming while preserving traditions privately. Massacres at Sivas (1993) and earlier Dersim (1937-1938) demonstrated costs of asserting public identity. Yet Alevis chose to maintain community despite risks, valuing spiritual authenticity over safety.

The role of the dede (hereditary spiritual guide) creates tension between authority and autonomy. Dedes inherit their position through lineage traced to the Prophet's family, yet effectiveness requires personal spiritual realization and community recognition. Followers choose which dede to follow and can withdraw allegiance if guidance seems inadequate. This dynamic balance prevents absolute authority while maintaining traditional structures.

Alevi ethics emphasize "control your hand, tongue, and loins" (Eline, diline, beline sahip ol), reflecting belief that mastery of impulse represents authentic freedom rather than constraint.

*** 1.16.142 BAHÁʼÍ FAITH Response

Do we have free will? The Baháʼí Faith, founded by Baháʼu'lláh in nineteenth-century Persia and now spread globally, offers a comprehensive vision of human agency rooted in progressive revelation and humanity's collective coming-of-age. Our understanding balances divine guidance with human responsibility, affirming freedom while recognizing our essential dependence on divine assistance.

According to Baháʼí teachings in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Most Holy Book) and Baháʼu'lláh's extensive writings, humans possess a rational soul distinguishing us from animals and enabling conscious moral choice. This capacity for volition represents a divine gift intrinsic to human nature. We're created "to know and worship" God, yet this relationship must be freely chosen to have spiritual meaning. Coerced devotion contradicts the essential purpose of human existence.

The Baháʼí principle of independent investigation of truth fundamentally assumes human freedom. We're obligated to examine religious claims personally rather than accepting inherited belief uncritically. This epistemological independence honors individual capacity for rational discernment while creating responsibility for spiritual development. Baháʼu'lláh wrote that God has given us "eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to understand," implying we possess faculties for autonomous judgment.

However, Baháʼí thought recognizes constraints on freedom. Our lower nature, associated with ego and attachment to material reality, inclines us toward selfishness and passion. The higher nature, reflecting divine attributes like love, justice, and truthfulness, represents our authentic spiritual identity. Genuine freedom consists in aligning with this higher nature through voluntary submission to divine guidance. As 'Abdu'l-Bahá explained, true liberty isn't license but capacity to manifest spiritual potential.

The concept of progressive revelation shapes our temporal understanding of freedom. Throughout history, divine Manifestations—Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ, Muhammad, the Báb, and Baháʼu'lláh—have revealed teachings appropriate to humanity's evolving capacity. This suggests that collective human freedom develops historically. Earlier societies required more prescriptive guidance; contemporary humanity enters maturity, capable of establishing global governance, gender equality, and universal education through conscious choice.

Practically, Baháʼí communities organize around consultation, a decision-making process requiring frank expression of views, collective deliberation, and unified implementation of decisions reached by majority vote. This method honors individual perspectives while recognizing that community wisdom exceeds individual understanding. Once consultation concludes and decisions are made, individuals freely commit to supporting outcomes even if they initially disagreed—a sophisticated practice of freedom exercised through voluntary unity.

The Baháʼí emphasis on eliminating prejudice of all kinds—racial, national, religious, class, gender—reflects conviction that authentic freedom requires transcending conditioning. Prejudice operates unconsciously, determining responses without conscious choice. Spiritual development involves recognizing and overcoming these deterministic patterns.

The Universal House of Justice, elected globally, provides authoritative guidance while explicitly avoiding infringement on individual conscience in personal matters, demonstrating institutional respect for freedom within a structured faith.

*** 1.16.143 AHMADIYYA ISLAM Response

Do we have free will? The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1889 in Qadian, India, approaches human agency through orthodox Islamic theology while emphasizing rational understanding and the renewal of faith for the modern age. Our position synthesizes Quranic teaching, Hadith, and the insights of the Promised Messiah, affirming genuine human freedom within the framework of divine omniscience and sovereignty.

According to Ahmadiyya interpretation, the Quran repeatedly addresses humans with commands, prohibitions, promises, and warnings—a mode of address meaningless unless we possess genuine capacity to choose obedience or disobedience. Verses like "Let there be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) and "whoever wills, let him believe, and whoever wills, let him disbelieve" (18:29) explicitly acknowledge human volition. The divine plan includes human freedom as an essential element, not an unfortunate limitation on sovereignty.

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad clarified the relationship between divine knowledge and human freedom. God's foreknowledge of all events, including our choices, doesn't causally determine those choices. Divine knowledge operates timelessly, comprehending all temporal moments simultaneously without creating them. The Promised Messiah used the analogy of a teacher who knows which students will succeed and which will fail—this knowledge doesn't cause the outcomes but perceives them. Similarly, divine foreknowledge observes rather than compels human choices.

The Ahmadiyya emphasis on reason and evidence in religious matters presupposes human capacity for rational judgment. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad invited skeptics to examine his claims critically, offering reasoned arguments and empirical verification through fulfilled prophecies. This approach assumes individuals can freely evaluate evidence and reach independent conclusions. Faith becomes a rational choice rather than blind acceptance or predetermined outcome.

However, Ahmadiyya teaching recognizes that absolute freedom is neither possible nor desirable. We exist within networks of causation—biological, psychological, social, and spiritual. Our choices emerge from character shaped by heredity, environment, education, and past decisions. Yet this web of influences doesn't eliminate agency; it contextualizes it. We retain capacity to respond to influences rather than being mechanically determined by them.

The concept of tawfiq (divine enabling) adds complexity. While we possess free will to choose between right and wrong, our capacity to successfully implement good choices depends on divine assistance. We cannot achieve spiritual progress through willpower alone but require God's grace. Prayer, therefore, isn't futile petition to change divine decree but a means of accessing the spiritual strength enabling effective exercise of freedom.

Practically, Ahmadiyya community organization demonstrates this balanced view. The Khalifa (Caliph) provides spiritual guidance and administrative direction, yet individual members freely choose their level of participation in community life. The strong emphasis on education, with schools and universities in multiple countries, reflects confidence in human capacity for rational development and moral growth through informed choice.

The Ahmadiyya commitment to peaceful propagation rather than coercion embodies respect for free will.

*** 1.16.144 NATION OF ISLAM Response

Do we have free will? The Nation of Islam, founded by Wallace Fard Muhammad and developed by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, addresses human agency through a distinctive theological-historical framework centered on the liberation of Black people in America. Our understanding connects free will to knowledge of self, historical consciousness, and collective empowerment within a cosmology that inverts traditional religious narratives.

According to the teachings transmitted through Elijah Muhammad's Message to the Blackman in America and elaborated by Minister Louis Farrakhan, the fundamental question of freedom begins with knowledge. The so-called Negro in America exists in a state of mental slavery, conditioned by centuries of oppression to think, act, and identify according to white supremacist programming. In this condition of ignorance about true self, history, and divine purpose, apparent choices merely reproduce subordination. Genuine free will requires first achieving knowledge of self—understanding that the Original Man is the Asiatic Black man, maker and owner of the planet Earth.

The Nation teaches that Master Fard Muhammad came to wake the dead—not physically dead but mentally dead, lost in ignorance of identity and destiny. This awakening represents a transition from deterministic existence shaped by white supremacy to authentic agency grounded in truth. The process isn't automatic but requires individual choice to accept teachings, study lessons, and implement discipline transforming consciousness and behavior.

Our cosmology positions this struggle within cosmic history. The white race, created six thousand years ago by the scientist Yakub through selective breeding to rule temporarily, has dominated through deception and force. This historical framework explains present conditions while affirming that current arrangements aren't eternal or natural. The prophecy that this age ends and the Black nation rises to proper position provides metaphysical ground for hope and action. Freedom becomes possible because historical change is divinely ordained, yet individual and collective choices determine how we participate in this transition.

The Fruit of Islam (FOI) training for men and Muslim Girls Training (MGT) for women exemplify the Nation's approach to developing disciplined agency. These programs teach dietary regulations, personal hygiene, self-defense, economic cooperation, and moral conduct. Far from restricting freedom, this discipline creates capacity for self-determination. The man controlled by appetite, addiction, or ignorance isn't free regardless of legal rights. True freedom requires mastery of self.

Economic teaching emphasizes collective self-sufficiency. Elijah Muhammad's call to "do for self," establishing Black businesses and buying land, represents exercise of economic freedom undermining dependence on white institutions. The emphasis on pooling resources, supporting Black enterprise, and developing separate institutions demonstrates that freedom operates collectively, not merely individually.

The Nation's complex relationship with mainstream Islam reflects tension between particularity and universality. While orthodox Muslims critique Nation theology, the movement has effectively mobilized thousands toward self-improvement, dignity, and empowerment. Malcolm X's journey from Nation of Islam to Sunni Islam and Pan-African consciousness illustrates individual evolution—his choices shaped by but not determined by institutional frameworks.

*** 1.16.145 MOORISH SCIENCE TEMPLE Response

Do we have free will? The Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Noble Drew Ali in 1913, addresses human agency through the redemptive power of national identity and divine knowledge. Our understanding centers on the transformative revelation that so-called Negroes, Blacks, and colored people are actually Asiatic Moors, with all rights, powers, and responsibilities that true identity entails.

According to the Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple, revealed through Prophet Noble Drew Ali, the fundamental obstacle to human freedom is misnaming and misidentification. When people don't know their true national origin, they cannot exercise authentic agency. The labels "Negro," "Black," and "colored" are slave names that perpetuate mental and social bondage even after legal emancipation. These designations weren't freely chosen but imposed, creating a deterministic social identity that channels life possibilities into subordinate paths.

The act of proclaiming Moorish nationality represents the essential exercise of free will available to descendants of Morocco in America. Each individual must choose to accept this truth, obtain a nationality card, and add the proper surname—El or Bey—signifying Moorish identity. This isn't assigned but claimed through conscious decision. The Temple provides knowledge and opportunity, but each person must freely embrace their divine and national identity.

Our cosmology teaches that all people descend from one common ancestry but have differentiated into distinct nations, each with divine purpose. Moors belong to the ancient Moabite nation, descended through Hagar and Ishmael, connected to Islamic civilization. This national-divine identity exists as objective truth whether recognized or not, yet its practical efficacy depends on conscious acknowledgment and public declaration. Thus free will operates in the epistemological domain—choosing to know what is already ontologically true.

The Moorish Science Temple's emphasis on Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice as foundational principles establishes ethical framework for exercising freedom. Liberty without moral foundation degenerates into license. Prophet Noble Drew Ali taught that we must return to those ancient principles that brought civilization, demonstrating that authentic freedom involves alignment with timeless truths, not arbitrary individual preference.

Practically, the Temple encourages economic cooperation, education, and civic participation. The Moorish Manufacturing Corporation and various business enterprises represent collective exercise of economic freedom. By pooling resources and supporting Moorish businesses, members develop self-sufficiency reducing dependence on oppressive systems.

The Clean and Pure Nation teaching promotes moral discipline, personal hygiene, and lawful conduct. These standards might appear restrictive, yet the Temple views them as liberating—elevating Moors from degraded social position to dignified national standing. True freedom requires self-mastery and moral excellence, not indulgence of every impulse.

Historical context illuminates the Temple's appeal. Founded during the Great Migration, when Black Southerners fled Jim Crow seeking better lives in Northern cities, the Temple offered identity transcending racial subordination. Claiming Moorish nationality provided psychological liberation and legal strategy, as members argued their status as Asiatics exempted them from racial restrictions.

*** 1.16.146 FIVE PERCENTERS Response

Do we have free will? The Five Percent Nation, also known as the Nation of Gods and Earths, founded by Clarence 13X (Allah) in 1964, addresses human agency through the radical teaching that the Black man is God and possesses unlimited creative potential. Our understanding rejects traditional theological frameworks where humans are subordinate creatures, instead affirming each righteous Black man as Allah, exercising divine sovereignty over his own reality.

According to Supreme Mathematics and Supreme Alphabet—the foundational knowledge systems developed by the Father Allah—true understanding begins with knowledge of self as God. The very name "Nation of Gods and Earths" declares ontological status: Black men are Gods, Black women are Earths, and children are the Stars. This isn't metaphorical but literal truth. When the Black man knows himself as God, he recognizes his inherent power to shape reality through knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.

The teaching divides humanity into three categories: the 85% who are mentally deaf, dumb, and blind to truth, easily led and manipulated; the 10% who possess knowledge but use it to deceive and exploit the 85%; and the 5% who are poor righteous teachers, knowing truth and working to enlighten others. This framework positions free will within epistemological context. The 85% lack real freedom because they lack knowledge; they react to conditioning rather than acting from understanding. The 10% exercise power but for selfish ends. The 5% achieve authentic freedom through knowledge of self and dedication to righteousness.

The process of "getting knowledge" represents the transition from determinism to agency. Gods (enlightened Five Percenters) engage others through "building"—sharing Supreme Mathematics, Supreme Alphabet, and the 120 Lessons (Student Enrollment, Lost-Found Muslim Lessons). This transmission isn't forced but offered. Each individual must freely choose to study, memorize, internalize, and live these teachings. The emphasis on memorization and recitation demonstrates that freedom requires mental discipline—holding knowledge in consciousness where it can guide choice.

Supreme Mathematics assigns meaning to numbers 1 through 10, with zero representing "cipher"—the completion of a circle of knowledge. Number 1 is Knowledge, 2 is Wisdom, 3 is Understanding, and so forth. These aren't arbitrary assignments but decoded truths revealing the mathematical structure of reality. When one masters Supreme Mathematics, one gains capacity to "build mathematics on any situation," meaning to analyze and respond to life circumstances from elevated consciousness rather than reactive conditioning.

The absence of formal organizational hierarchy in the Five Percent Nation reflects radical commitment to individual sovereignty. While the Father Allah founded the Nation, there's no centralized authority dictating belief or practice. Each God is autonomous, responsible for his own development and teaching. Parliaments gather for discussion and building, but decisions aren't imposed from above. This decentralized structure embodies the principle that every God is supreme in his own right.

Gender dynamics reveal complexity in the teaching. Women are designated Earths rather than Gods, positioned as companions and mothers but not exercising the same divine sovereignty attributed to men.

*** 1.16.147 RASTAFARI Response

Do we have free will? Rastafari, the movement emerging from 1930s Jamaica recognizing Haile Selassie I as divine manifestation, addresses human agency through concepts of liberation, repatriation, and alignment with natural law. Our understanding sees freedom not as abstract philosophical possibility but as concrete spiritual, mental, and political condition requiring active cultivation through righteous living and consciousness.

According to Rastafari teaching, transmitted through reasoning sessions, reggae music, and the example of elders, humanity exists under Babylon—the oppressive system of economic exploitation, political domination, and cultural alienation descended from slavery and colonialism. This system operates through mental conditioning as much as physical coercion, shaping desires, beliefs, and self-conception to perpetuate subordination. In this condition, apparent choices merely reproduce bondage. The person who accepts Babylon's values, pursues Babylon's goals, and thinks in Babylon's categories isn't free regardless of legal status.

Liberation begins with mental decolonization—recognizing Babylon's nature and rejecting its authority over consciousness. The declaration that Haile Selassie I (Ras Tafari) is Jah (God) incarnate represents radical rejection of European religious hegemony and affirmation of African divinity. This isn't mere belief but transformative recognition reorienting entire existence. Each individual must freely accept this truth; it cannot be inherited or imposed. The reasoning tradition, where Rastas gather to discuss scripture, current events, and spiritual matters while sharing the chalice, creates communal context for individual insight and decision.

The vow to wear dreadlocks represents free commitment to visible distinction from Babylon. Growing locks isn't casual fashion but covenant demonstrating willingness to accept social consequences of Rastafari identity. This choice has historically invited discrimination in employment, education, and public space, yet Rastas freely embrace these costs as part of righteous path. The locks themselves symbolize the Nazarite vow and natural growth uncompromised by artificial conformity.

Ital livity—the dietary and lifestyle practices emphasizing natural, unprocessed foods and rejecting chemical additives and meat—demonstrates freedom through discipline. Rather than consuming whatever Babylon's food industry offers, Rastas consciously choose nutrition promoting vitality and clarity. This isn't deprivation but liberation from addictive, unhealthy patterns. Similarly, the sacramental use of cannabis represents freedom to access altered consciousness for meditation and insight despite legal prohibition.

The vision of repatriation to Africa (specifically Ethiopia) as spiritual and potentially physical return represents ultimate freedom—escape from Babylon's dominion to Zion, the promised land. While most Rastas haven't literally relocated, the principle of repatriation functions as spiritual orientation toward African identity, rejecting psychological exile and claiming rightful inheritance.

Reggae music, particularly through Bob Marley's global influence, became vehicle for spreading Rastafari consciousness. Songs like "Redemption Song" explicitly address freedom: "Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery / None but ourselves can free our minds." This places responsibility for liberation on individual and collective will, not external saviors.

The Ethiopian Orthodox influence on some Rastafari demonstrates evolution and diversity within the movement.

*** 1.16.148 ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX TEWAHEDO Response

Do we have free will? The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, one of Christianity's most ancient expressions tracing continuous tradition to the fourth century, addresses human agency through distinctive Christology and theological synthesis of Hebrew, Christian, and African streams. Our understanding affirms genuine human freedom within the framework of divine sovereignty, emphasizing moral responsibility while recognizing dependence on divine grace.

According to Tewahedo teaching, preserved in the Ge'ez liturgy, the Fetha Negest (Law of Kings), and the writings of Ethiopian theological tradition, humanity was created in the divine image with intellect and will. These capacities enable us to know God and choose righteousness. The creation narrative in Genesis establishes that from the beginning, humans faced meaningful choice—symbolized by the command regarding the tree of knowledge. Adam's disobedience wasn't predetermined but represented authentic exercise of will, unfortunately directed toward rebellion.

Our Christology shapes understanding of freedom's restoration. The term "Tewahedo" means "being made one," referring to the unified nature of Christ—fully divine and fully human in complete union without separation, mixture, or confusion. This distinctive position, formulated against Chalcedonian dyophysitism, has profound implications for human capacity. In Christ, divinity and humanity unite, demonstrating that human nature can bear divine presence and cooperate with divine will. The Incarnation doesn't override human freedom but elevates and restores it.

The Ethiopian Orthodox emphasis on the Old Testament, with the Ark of the Covenant believed to rest in Axum's Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, connects Christian faith to covenantal tradition. The covenant relationship presupposes two parties freely entering binding agreement. God's covenant with Abraham, renewed through Moses and fulfilled in Christ, requires human response—acceptance and obedience that must be freely given to have meaning.

Fasting practices central to Ethiopian Orthodox life demonstrate the relationship between discipline and freedom. We observe numerous fast days throughout the year, including the fifty-five-day Lenten fast, Wednesdays and Fridays weekly, and various other periods totaling over two hundred fast days annually. During fasts, believers abstain from animal products and often delay eating until afternoon. This rigorous discipline might appear as restriction, yet the tradition views it as liberation—mastery of bodily appetites that would otherwise master us. True freedom requires self-control, not license.

Monasticism plays vital role in Ethiopian Orthodox spirituality, with communities like Debre Libanos maintaining contemplative tradition for centuries. Monks freely renounce worldly life to pursue undistracted devotion. This radical choice demonstrates that authentic freedom can express itself through voluntary limitation, when that limitation serves higher purpose. The monk isn't less free than the worldly person but differently free—liberated from attachments that bind most people.

The Kebra Nagast (Glory of Kings), Ethiopia's national epic narrating the Queen of Sheba's visit to Solomon and the Ark's journey to Ethiopia, emphasizes choice and consequence across generations. Characters face decisions with lasting implications for themselves and descendants.

*** 1.16.149 COPTIC ORTHODOX Response

Do we have free will? The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, maintaining continuous apostolic succession through Saint Mark to the present, addresses human agency through patristic theology, particularly the thought of Alexandrian fathers like Athanasius, Cyril, and the desert monastics. Our understanding affirms genuine human freedom as essential to moral responsibility while emphasizing the necessity of divine grace for salvation.

According to Coptic teaching, rooted in Scripture and developed through centuries of theological reflection during formative Christian centuries, humans are created in the divine image (imago Dei) with rational soul and free will. These divine-like attributes distinguish humanity from other creatures and establish capacity for relationship with God. The command given to Adam in Paradise presupposed ability to obey or disobey. Without genuine freedom, the command would be meaningless and any transgression unjust to punish.

The Fall corrupted human nature but didn't eliminate free will. Post-lapsarian humanity retains capacity to choose but with diminished ability to consistently choose good. We became enslaved to sin, meaning our will, though still free in formal sense, became habitually oriented toward selfishness and rebellion. This distinction between formal freedom (ability to choose) and practical freedom (ability to choose rightly) is crucial. We possess the former continuously but require divine assistance to recover the latter.

Saint Athanasius, the great Coptic defender of Trinitarian orthodoxy, articulated how the Incarnation restores human freedom. In becoming human, the divine Word united with human nature, deifying it through union while respecting its integrity. Christ's humanity, fully free and perfectly oriented toward the Father, demonstrates what redeemed human freedom looks like. Through mystical union with Christ in the Church's sacraments, believers participate in this restored freedom.

The Coptic Orthodox emphasis on theosis (deification)—that humans are called to become by grace what God is by nature—elevates the purpose and dignity of human freedom. We're not merely avoiding punishment or gaining reward but actually being transformed into divine likeness. This transformation requires continuous free cooperation with grace. God doesn't override our will but invites response, working within us as we consent to transformation.

The desert fathers and mothers who pioneered Christian monasticism in Egypt developed profound understanding of will and desire. Through years of ascetic discipline, prayer, and spiritual combat with demons and passions, they observed how apparent freedom is often slavery to unconscious compulsions. Abba Poemen taught that true freedom comes not from doing whatever we want but from purifying desires so we want what we should. The monk's obedience to abba (spiritual father), far from crushing freedom, gradually liberates will from tyranny of ego.

Coptic liturgy, particularly the Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil, expresses synergistic view of salvation. Prayers repeatedly ask for divine mercy and assistance while acknowledging human responsibility to respond faithfully. The liturgical phrase "Amen" repeated throughout worship represents the congregation's free assent to divine action and truth proclaimed.

Historical Coptic witness under Islamic rule since the seventh century demonstrates collective exercise of freedom under severe constraint.

*** 1.16.150 ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC Response

Do we have free will? The Armenian Apostolic Church, claiming foundation by the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus and officially established under Saint Gregory the Illuminator in 301 AD as the world's first state Christian church, addresses human agency through distinctive theological development shaped by rejection of both Chalcedonian and monophysite extremes. Our understanding affirms human freedom within the framework of divine providence and emphasizes moral responsibility for individual and national destiny.

According to Armenian Orthodox teaching, preserved through the Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, the theological works of Saint Nerses Shnorhali, and continuous tradition through the Catholicos, humanity was created with authentic freedom as essential aspect of divine image. God, who is supremely free, created beings capable of freely responding to divine love. Without this capacity, the relationship between Creator and creature would be mechanical rather than personal, coerced rather than loving.

Our Christology, following Miaphysite formulation affirmed at the Council of Dvin (506), confesses one united nature of Christ from two natures—divine and human—without separation, mixture, or confusion. This subtle position distinguishes Armenian thought from both Chalcedonian dyophysitism and Eutychian monophysitism. The Christological implications for human freedom are significant: Christ's humanity, fully united with divinity, demonstrates that human nature and divine nature can cooperate without the human will being absorbed or overridden. This provides theological ground for synergistic soteriology where human freedom and divine grace work together.

The Armenian theological tradition, especially in figures like Gregory of Narek (tenth century), developed profound psychology of will and desire. Narek's Book of Lamentations explores the anguished freedom of the soul aware of sinfulness yet yearning for God. His prayers don't portray humans as puppets of deterministic fate but as moral agents capable of repentance, choice, and transformation through divine mercy. The very act of lamentation presupposes meaningful freedom—acknowledging that one could have chosen differently and may yet choose better.

Armenian monasticism, with centers like Tatev and Haghpat producing scholars, manuscripts, and spiritual guidance for centuries, emphasized disciplined formation of will. Monks freely renounced worldly pursuits to dedicate themselves to prayer, study, and service. This monastic tradition preserved Armenian culture during centuries when the nation lacked political independence, demonstrating that spiritual freedom can persist despite political subjugation.

The tragic history of the Armenian people, particularly the genocide of 1915-1923 where over one million Armenians were killed, presents extreme test of freedom and faith. Victims faced choice—deny Christian faith and possibly survive, or maintain identity and face death. Thousands chose martyrdom, exercising ultimate freedom to value spiritual integrity over biological survival. This collective witness demonstrates that human freedom, while constrained by circumstance, retains essential capacity to choose what matters most even when facing annihilation.

The Armenian diaspora resulting from genocide scattered communities worldwide, yet most maintained religious and cultural identity through voluntary commitment across generations.
