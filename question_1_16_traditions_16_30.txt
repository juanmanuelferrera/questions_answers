*** 1.16.16 LUTHERAN (PIETIST) Response

Do we have free will? This question touches the very core of our personal relationship with God. As Pietist Lutherans, we affirm that human will is deeply corrupted by original sin, yet transformed through heartfelt conversion and regeneration. Philip Jakob Spener taught that while we cannot initiate our own salvation, the regenerate Christian experiences a genuine freedom to respond to God's grace with active devotion.

The bondage of the will, as Luther described, means natural humanity cannot turn toward God without the Holy Spirit's prior work. We are spiritually dead, unable to choose divine things. However—and this marks our distinctive emphasis—once the Spirit awakens the heart through the Word, a new freedom emerges. This freedom is not mere philosophical liberty but experiential reality, manifest in prayer closets, Bible study groups, and small gatherings where believers cultivate holy living.

Our Pietist conventicles demonstrate this transformed will in action. When sincere Christians gather for mutual edification, sharing testimonies of God's work in their lives, they exercise genuine spiritual freedom—not in choosing their initial salvation, but in responding to sanctifying grace. August Hermann Francke's orphanages and schools embodied this freedom: redeemed people freely choosing compassionate service, not from compulsion but from hearts renewed by the Spirit.

We reject both Pelagian presumption and fatalistic despair. Yes, fallen humanity lacks free will toward God, enslaved to sin's power. But regenerate humanity, indwelt by the Spirit, exercises real freedom in progressive sanctification. The devout believer chooses daily Bible reading, not mechanically but willingly. The converted heart selects prayer over worldliness, charity over selfishness, because inner transformation has created new desires.

This practical, experiential focus distinguishes us from scholastic Lutheranism. We care less about metaphysical mechanics and more about vital Christianity. Does the awakened sinner feel God's drawing? Does the converted believer experience genuine choice in spiritual disciplines? Affirmative testimony from countless pietists confirms this reality.

Critics charge us with synergism, suggesting we grant too much human cooperation. We respond that acknowledging post-conversion freedom differs from claiming pre-conversion ability. The clay cannot shape itself, but once the Potter remolds it, the vessel serves its purpose willingly.

Our answer balances divine sovereignty with human responsibility. Salvation's initiation is monergistic—God alone. Sanctification's progression is synergistic—God's grace met by willing cooperation. The Christian life requires active participation, not passive reception. We choose holiness, Bible study, and evangelistic witness because grace has freed us to choose rightly. This freedom is gift, not achievement, yet genuinely ours in Christ.

*** 1.16.17 LUTHERAN (LIBERAL) Response

Do we have free will? This question requires demythologization and reinterpretation for modern consciousness. As liberal Lutherans, we approach this matter not through medieval metaphysics but through contemporary understanding of human autonomy, moral agency, and religious experience. The traditional Lutheran doctrine of the bound will reflects pre-scientific worldviews that contemporary theology must transcend while preserving essential religious insights.

Adolf von Harnack and Albrecht Ritschl taught us to distinguish between the kernel of Christian truth and the husk of outdated cosmology. The "bondage of the will" represents not metaphysical fact but existential description of humanity's moral struggle. When Luther spoke of enslavement to sin, he articulated the psychological reality that people often act against their better judgment—what Paul called doing evil one doesn't want to do. This describes human condition, not cosmic determinism.

Modern psychology, particularly depth psychology, illuminates what pre-modern theology described mythologically. Unconscious drives, social conditioning, and neurological factors influence behavior significantly. Yet this doesn't eliminate freedom; rather, it contextualizes it. Free will exists not as absolute libertarian freedom but as bounded autonomy within biological, psychological, and social parameters.

We reject supernaturalistic interventionism that portrays God mechanically overriding human will. Such primitive theism contradicts scientific understanding and moral sensibility. Instead, we understand divine-human relationship symbolically and ethically. "Grace" means the power of religious ideals and moral exemplars—supremely Jesus—to inspire human transformation. "Conversion" describes psychological reorientation toward ethical living, not supernatural regeneration.

The historical Jesus presented moral teachings emphasizing human responsibility and ethical choice. His call to repentance presupposes genuine decision-making capacity. The kingdom of God represents an ethical commonwealth requiring human cooperation and moral effort. Mythological language about divine intervention must be reinterpreted as symbolic expression of moral imperatives and spiritual possibilities.

Our approach harmonizes Christianity with Kantian ethics and Enlightenment values. Moral responsibility requires freedom; "ought" implies "can." The categorical imperative functions only if humans possess genuine capacity for autonomous moral decision. Christianity's ethical teachings presuppose this capacity, regardless of what pre-critical theology claimed.

Critics accuse us of Pelagianism and reducing Christianity to mere moralism. We respond that we're recovering Jesus's original ethical message from later theological accretions. The historical-critical method reveals that Paul's radical statements about human inability reflect his particular theological construction, not Jesus's teachings.

We affirm human free will as both psychological reality and ethical necessity. People make genuine choices within their circumstances. Religious language about divine grace symbolizes the inspiration humans draw from religious traditions and moral ideals. Christianity's value lies in its ethical teachings and Jesus's exemplary life, both of which presuppose and call forth human freedom, moral responsibility, and autonomous choice toward realizing the kingdom's ethical vision.

*** 1.16.18 LUTHERAN (NEO-ORTHODOX) Response

Do we have free will? This question cannot be answered through rational speculation or liberal sentimentality but only through encounter with God's Word in crisis and decision. As neo-orthodox Lutherans, we recover Luther's dialectical insights while rejecting both Protestant scholasticism and liberal rationalism. Karl Barth and Rudolf Bultmann, though differing significantly, both understood that freedom and bondage must be addressed existentially, not metaphysically.

Luther's "Bondage of the Will" contains profound truth obscured by later Lutheran orthodoxy's rationalistic systematizing. Human will is indeed bound—not by mechanistic determinism but by existential rebellion against God. We are free to choose among worldly options but incapable of choosing God without divine intervention. This paradox cannot be resolved logically; it must be encountered in the crisis of faith.

The dialectical theology approach recognizes that human existence involves genuine decision-making within historical existence while simultaneously acknowledging absolute dependence upon God's sovereign grace. When God's Word confronts us as wholly other, we face authentic decision—yet this decision itself is possible only through God's enabling. The moment of faith is both divine gift and human response, a paradox that systematic theology cannot dissolve.

Emil Brunner articulated this dialectic clearly: humans are responsible agents who genuinely decide, yet salvation comes entirely from God's side. The image of God, though defaced by sin, means humans remain decision-making beings. We are not stones or animals but persons who respond. However, the fallen person's every decision remains self-centered until grace interrupts. The "new being" in Christ experiences freedom not as natural possession but as gift continuously renewed.

Existentialist philosophy, particularly Kierkegaard's influence, illuminates this understanding. Freedom is not abstract metaphysical property but concrete existence before God. In the moment of authentic decision—what Kierkegaard called the "leap of faith"—humans experience both radical freedom and absolute dependence. This paradox resists rational resolution but rings true existentially.

We reject the Enlightenment's autonomous man as illusory. Liberal theology's optimistic humanism ignores sin's radical reality and humanity's desperate situation. Conversely, we reject deterministic Calvinism that makes God's sovereignty mechanistic and reduces human beings to puppets. Both errors result from rationalistic systematizing that domesticates the living God.

The Christ-event reveals true freedom. In Jesus Christ, we encounter the one who was "free for us"—perfectly obedient to the Father while fully human. In union with Christ through faith, believers participate in his freedom. This freedom is neither natural capacity nor mere permission but new reality established by God's act in Christ.

Our answer: Yes and No. No, humans lack free will toward God in their natural state—not due to metaphysical necessity but existential rebellion. Yes, the person confronted by God's Word in Christ experiences genuine freedom—not autonomous self-determination but freedom for obedience, freedom for neighbor, freedom from self-obsession.

*** 1.16.19 REFORMED (CALVINIST) Response

Do we have free will? This question requires careful distinction between different senses of freedom and willing. As Reformed believers following Calvin's comprehensive biblical theology, we affirm that humans possess voluntary agency while denying libertarian free will regarding spiritual matters. The Westminster Confession precisely articulates this: God has "endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that is neither forced, nor, by any absolute necessity of nature, determined to good or evil."

Human beings are not machines or stones. We deliberate, choose, and act according to our desires and judgments. In this sense, we possess voluntary agency—we do what we want. However, the crucial question is: Can fallen humanity want God, desire holiness, or choose Christ without divine intervention? Scripture and experience answer decisively: No.

Total depravity—the first point of Dort's canons—teaches that sin has corrupted every faculty, including the will. Unregenerate persons are "dead in trespasses and sins" (Ephesians 2:1), "slaves to sin" (Romans 6:17), and "unable to please God" (Romans 8:8). The natural man cannot discern spiritual things (1 Corinthians 2:14). These are not metaphors but descriptions of spiritual reality.

Jonathan Edwards's "Freedom of the Will" remains definitive. He demonstrated that humans always choose according to their strongest inclination. We are free from external compulsion but not from our own nature. The unregenerate will necessarily chooses evil because fallen nature is evil. The regenerate will freely chooses good because renewed nature desires God. In neither case is the will "free" in the libertarian sense—able to choose equally between alternatives.

God's unconditional election and irresistible grace do not violate human will but transform it. Regeneration creates new desires, new affections, new inclinations. The elect come to Christ willingly—indeed, with great eagerness—because God has given them new hearts that desire him. As Augustine said, God "makes willing those who were unwilling."

This is not coercion but liberation. Sin's bondage is real slavery; grace's necessity is true freedom. The Westminster divines understood this perfectly: fallen man has lost "all ability of will to any spiritual good," yet God "converts sinners by changing their hearts and powerfully determining their wills."

Critics charge this denies human responsibility. We respond that responsibility requires voluntary action, not libertarian freedom. God holds people accountable for their willing choices, even though those choices flow necessarily from their nature. The wicked are justly punished because they do what they want—the problem is what they want.

Our doctrine glorifies God's sovereignty while explaining human experience. We feel ourselves choosing, and we are—according to our nature. Conversion feels like liberation, and it is—from sin's dominion. The Christian increasingly chooses holiness, and genuinely does—because grace has transformed desire.

The answer: No libertarian free will exists. Yes, voluntary agency operates. Fallen humans freely choose evil; redeemed humans freely choose good. Both necessities arise from nature, not external force. God's sovereign grace alone transitions persons from bondage to freedom, from death to life, accomplishing salvation completely.

*** 1.16.20 REFORMED (ARMINIAN) Response

Do we have free will? Yes, though only as enabled by prevenient grace, and this answer distinguishes us from both Pelagian error and Calvinist determinism. As Reformed Arminians following Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrant tradition, we affirm that God's gracious initiative restores sufficient freedom to accept or reject salvation, preserving both divine sovereignty and meaningful human responsibility.

Arminius himself remained thoroughly Reformed in affirming total depravity. Fallen humanity lacks natural ability to choose God; sin has thoroughly corrupted human nature, including the will. We differ from Calvinists not regarding human inability but regarding God's response to it. We believe God grants all persons sufficient grace to respond to the gospel—grace that can be genuinely accepted or resisted.

The Remonstrance of 1610 carefully articulated this: election is conditional upon foreseen faith, Christ died for all humanity, grace is resistible, and believers can fall from grace. These points presuppose that humans, assisted by prevenient grace, exercise genuine choice regarding salvation. This is not Pelagian self-salvation but synergistic cooperation with divine initiative.

John Wesley's Arminian theology, though Methodist in expression, shares our Reformed Arminian foundation. Wesley taught that prevenient grace—grace that "goes before"—restores sufficient freedom to respond to God's offer. This grace is universal, given to all through Christ's atonement, enabling (not compelling) positive response. The Spirit's work makes salvation possible; human response makes it actual.

This preserves God's sovereignty differently than Calvinism. God sovereignly chooses to make salvation genuinely available to all and to respect human response. Sovereign grace establishes conditions for free response rather than irresistibly determining outcomes. God's will that all be saved (1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:9) is sincere, not merely hypothetical.

Scripture's pervasive calls to "choose" and warnings against rejecting grace make no sense under determinism. Joshua's "choose this day whom you will serve" presupposes genuine alternatives. Jesus's lament over Jerusalem—"I would have gathered you, but you would not"—expresses real divine desire thwarted by human choice. Revelation's invitation—"let the one who wishes take the water of life freely"—offers real options.

Calvinists object that this makes human will decisive, undermining grace's necessity. We respond that grace remains absolutely necessary—we affirm total depravity. However, necessary grace need not be irresistible grace. God's power is demonstrated not in overwhelming reluctant wills but in persuading through love while respecting personhood.

Others charge we cannot explain why some believe and others don't, if grace is universal. We acknowledge mystery here but prefer this mystery to Calvinism's—why God unconditionally elects some and passes over others. Our mystery preserves God's universal love and justice; theirs seems to impugn divine character.

The practical difference is significant. We preach with confidence that God genuinely offers salvation to all hearers. We warn backsliders that apostasy is real danger. We emphasize perseverance as requiring ongoing cooperation with grace, not merely passive reliance on unconditional security.

Our answer: Free will exists as restored capacity, not natural possession. Prevenient grace enables genuine response while remaining resistible. God's sovereignty and human responsibility coexist through gracious enablement that invites without coercing.

*** 1.16.21 REFORMED (NEO-CALVINIST) Response

Do we have free will? This question requires situating within the comprehensive biblical worldview of creation, fall, and redemption, as Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck taught. As neo-Calvinists, we transcend narrow soteriological focus to address freedom within God's sovereignty over all spheres of life—family, education, politics, arts, sciences, and commerce. Free will cannot be isolated to individual salvation but must be understood cosmically and covenantally.

Kuyper's sphere sovereignty principle illuminates this. God created distinct life-spheres, each with inherent authority and appropriate freedom within its domain. The state has authority over justice, the family over nurture, the church over spiritual matters—each sphere operating according to its creational design. Within each sphere, humans exercise genuine agency according to that sphere's nature and God's structural ordinances.

The antithesis between belief and unbelief fundamentally shapes how freedom functions. Regenerate and unregenerate persons possess the same creaturely capacities but employ them according to different religious ground motives. The unbeliever exercises cultural freedom—developing sciences, creating art, building civilizations—but always directing these capacities away from God toward idolatrous ends. The believer exercises the same capacities redemptively, directing them toward God's glory.

This common grace doctrine is crucial. God restrains sin's full effects and enables unbelievers to achieve genuine cultural goods. Their work in science, philosophy, jurisprudence, and arts produces real knowledge and beauty, though ultimately misdirected. This is why Christians can learn from non-Christian scholarship while maintaining critical discernment. Unbelievers are genuinely free in cultural activities, though religiously enslaved.

Herman Bavinck's profound psychology of the will complements this. He distinguished between formal freedom (the structural capacity to will) and material freedom (willing according to God's law). All humans retain formal freedom—they are willing agents, not mechanical automatons. However, only the regenerate possess material freedom—the ability to will in harmony with God's revealed will.

Our Calvinism remains robust regarding salvation. Election is unconditional, grace is irresistible, Christ's atonement is particular, and preservation is certain. Fallen humanity lacks spiritual freedom; only sovereign regeneration by the Spirit restores it. However, this doesn't exhaust the freedom question. Even unregenerate persons exercise creaturely freedom in non-salvific domains.

The cultural mandate—"be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it"—remains operative post-fall. Humans still develop creation's potentials through agriculture, technology, governance, and education. This work requires genuine decision-making, creativity, and responsible agency. Sin corrupts how humans fulfill the mandate, not whether they possess capacity for cultural activity.

Dooyeweerd's philosophy of the cosmonomic idea further clarifies this. Human functioning involves multiple modal aspects—numerical, spatial, kinematic, physical, biotic, psychical, analytical, historical, linguistic, social, economic, aesthetic, juridical, ethical, and pistical. Freedom operates differently across these modalities. Mathematical and physical aspects involve less freedom; historical, ethical, and pistical aspects involve more.

Our worldview approach thus affirms: No libertarian free will exists regarding salvation—God's sovereign election determines this. Yes, creaturely freedom exists regarding cultural development—humans genuinely choose, create, and shape civilization. Both affirmations flow from God's sovereignty: he saves whom he chooses and he ordains human cultural agency according to creational design.

*** 1.16.22 REFORMED (BARTHIAN) Response

Do we have free will? This question cannot be answered through anthropological investigation or philosophical speculation but only through revelation of who God is and who humanity is in Jesus Christ. As Barthians following Karl Barth's Christocentric reconstruction of Reformed theology, we reject both traditional Reformed scholasticism's rationalistic categories and every form of natural theology that seeks to describe human capacities apart from God's self-revelation.

The Church Dogmatics revolutionized how we must approach this question. Barth insisted we cannot begin with abstract concepts of "freedom" or "will" but must begin where God begins—with Jesus Christ, the electing God and elected human. In Christ, we discover both who God truly is and who humanity is created and redeemed to be. All theological anthropology must be Christologically determined.

Traditional debates between Calvinists and Arminians, determinists and libertarians, operate within the wrong framework. They presuppose we can describe human nature, will, and freedom independently, then ask how God's grace relates to these pre-existing capacities. This inverts proper theological method. We don't know what "human freedom" means until we see it in Jesus Christ, the truly free human.

In Jesus Christ, we observe perfect freedom—not autonomous self-determination but freedom for obedience to the Father and freedom for service to others. This is the freedom for which humans were created and to which they are restored in reconciliation. Freedom is not choosing between equally possible alternatives but existing in right relationship with God and neighbor.

Barth's doctrine of election transforms everything. God eternally elected to be gracious God and to elect humanity in Christ. Jesus Christ is both the electing God and the elected human. In him, God chose grace and rejected judgment; God chose humanity and rejected godlessness. This election is the ontological reality underlying all existence. There is no "hidden God" behind Christ who might have decreed damnation.

What then of human choice and decision? Barth insisted that the gospel truly addresses humans with real decision—believe or disbelieve, obey or disobey. This decision is genuine, not illusory. However, human decision occurs within the ontological reality of God's prior decision in Christ. We decide freely, yet our decision has been preceded, encompassed, and determined by God's decision for us.

This is paradox, not contradiction. Barth rejected synthesis or explanation that would domesticate the mystery. Divine sovereignty and human freedom coexist in the form of encounter and response. When God's Word addresses humans, it creates the freedom to respond even while that response remains gift.

Critics charge that Barth's universal election undermines human decision's significance. If God has already elected all in Christ, why preach or decide? Barth responded that election is God's decision, not ours. We must still respond in faith and obedience, though this response enacts what God has already accomplished.

Others object that Barth's Christological method ignores common human experience of freedom. Barth would reply that apart from Christ, we misunderstand what freedom is. Natural humanity's supposed freedom is actually bondage to self. Only in Christ do we discover and receive true freedom.

Our answer: Free will as autonomous self-determination is illusion and impossibility. True freedom exists as gift in Jesus Christ—freedom to be human as God intends, freedom for God and neighbor. This freedom is both wholly divine gift and genuinely human reality, united without confusion in Christ.

*** 1.16.23 ANGLICAN (HIGH CHURCH) Response

Do we have free will? This question finds its proper answer within the ancient Catholic tradition preserved in Anglicanism through apostolic succession, sacramental grace, and patristic wisdom. As High Church Anglicans, we approach this matter not through the distortions of Protestant individualism or Calvinist determinism but through the balanced teaching of the undivided church, particularly the Eastern Fathers, whose theological depth surpasses Western controversies.

The Thirty-Nine Articles, properly understood within their historical context and Catholic matrix, present a via media between Pelagian presumption and Augustinian extremism. Article X states that "the condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God." This acknowledges human inability while avoiding Calvinist determinism.

The Fathers, especially the Greek Fathers whom the Caroline Divines treasured, taught synergism—divine grace and human will cooperating in salvation. St. John Chrysostom wrote that God draws those who will be drawn; he doesn't drag the unwilling. St. Basil taught that God awaits our small movement toward him, then rushes to assist. This patristic consensus recognizes both grace's necessity and human response's genuineness.

Our sacramental theology is crucial here. In baptism, preventing grace is poured into the soul, initiating the Christian life and providing capacity for cooperation with further grace. The baptized infant, though unconscious during the sacrament, has received objective grace that will enable subsequent faith and obedience. This grace doesn't coerce but enables.

The Book of Common Prayer's liturgy embodies this theology. We pray for grace to "have a good will" and to "work with" God's enabling. The Collect for Advent IV beseeches God to "cast thy bright beams of light upon thy Church, that it, being illumined by the doctrine of thy blessed Apostle and Evangelist Saint John, may so walk in the light of thy truth." We ask for illumination and empowerment, then walk—cooperating with given grace.

The sacrament of Holy Communion continually renews grace, strengthening the will toward holiness. The Real Presence, which we affirm against Protestant memorialism, means Christ truly nourishes souls, imparting spiritual strength. Frequent, reverent reception of the Blessed Sacrament transforms the will progressively.

Penance, our fourth sacrament, assumes genuine human agency. The penitent freely confesses sins, receives absolution, and performs satisfaction. This sacramental cycle presupposes real choice—to sin or not, to confess or withhold, to amend or persist. Yet grace operates throughout, enabling examination, contrition, confession, and amendment.

Lancelot Andrewes, John Cosin, and the Caroline Divines rejected both Calvinist predestinarianism and Pelagian self-sufficiency. They recovered patristic balance: humanity needs grace absolutely, yet cooperates with grace genuinely. This is neither Pelagian (grace merely helpful) nor Calvinist (grace irresistible and determinative).

Critics, particularly Evangelical Anglicans, charge us with Romanism or semi-Pelagianism. We respond that we simply maintain historic Christianity before Augustine's anti-Pelagian works introduced deterministic elements. The consensus patrum supports synergism.

Our answer: Free will, destroyed by the Fall, is restored progressively through sacramental grace. The baptized possess genuine though limited freedom to cooperate with grace or resist it. Salvation requires both divine initiative and human response, both sovereign grace and willing cooperation, united in the sacramental life of the Church under apostolic oversight.

*** 1.16.24 ANGLICAN (LOW CHURCH/EVANGELICAL) Response

Do we have free will? This fundamental question must be answered biblically, not through mere tradition or ecclesiastical authority. As Evangelical Anglicans, we stand firmly with the Reformers in affirming that fallen humanity lacks free will toward God, while glorying in the liberating grace that frees enslaved sinners through faith in Christ Jesus. Our commitment to Scripture's authority, justification by faith alone, and the necessity of conversion shapes our understanding.

The English Reformers—Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer—recovered biblical truth from medieval obscurity. Article X clearly states our position: fallen man "cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith." This isn't philosophical speculation but biblical doctrine derived from Romans, Ephesians, and the Gospels. Natural humanity is "dead in trespasses and sins" (Ephesians 2:1), incapable of spiritual good.

Charles Simeon's ministry at Cambridge exemplified our tradition. He preached evangelical conversion—the necessity of personal faith in Christ, enabled by the Holy Spirit's regenerating work. This presupposes that unregenerate persons lack freedom to choose God. The Spirit must first grant new birth; only then can one believe. "You must be born again" precedes "whoever believes in him shall not perish."

John Newton, William Wilberforce, and the Clapham Sect demonstrated evangelical faith's practical fruit. Wilberforce's decades-long campaign against slavery showed redeemed will in action—former slave-trader Newton's conversion and Wilberforce's perseverance both resulted from grace transforming enslaved wills into free servants of righteousness.

We affirm the Thirty-Nine Articles against both Roman works-righteousness and modern liberalism's optimistic humanism. Article XVII on predestination, properly understood, teaches that God's eternal purpose in Christ ensures believers' salvation. This doesn't make God author of evil but glorifies his sovereign grace in rescuing those justly condemned by their willing sin.

Conversion is crucial to our understanding. We don't merely assent to propositions or participate in sacraments; we must be born again by the Spirit through faith in Christ's atoning death. This new birth is wholly God's work, yet it produces real transformation. The converted person freely chooses righteousness because grace has created new desires, new affections, new nature.

J.C. Ryle's evangelical vigor characterizes our preaching. He insisted on biblical authority, salvation by grace through faith, and holy living as conversion's fruit. This combination requires that God's sovereign grace produce willing holiness. The believer freely pursues sanctification because regeneration has freed the will from sin's dominion.

Our view differs from High Church sacramentalism. Baptism is important but doesn't automatically regenerate. Many baptized persons remain unconverted, evidencing no spiritual life. The Spirit's internal work must accompany external sacraments. We emphasize personal faith and conscious conversion over sacramental mechanism.

Critics within Anglicanism charge we're too Protestant, abandoning Catholic heritage. We respond that we're recovering biblical Christianity and Reformational truth. Scripture must judge tradition, not vice versa. The Fathers were sometimes right, sometimes wrong; Scripture alone is infallible.

Our answer: No, fallen humans lack free will toward God—enslaved by sin, spiritually dead, unable to choose righteousness. Yes, regenerate believers possess genuine freedom—freed by Christ to choose holiness, empowered by the Spirit to pursue godliness. Conversion marks the transition from bondage to freedom, from death to life, all by sovereign grace through faith alone.

*** 1.16.25 ANGLICAN (BROAD CHURCH/LIBERAL) Response

Do we have free will? This question requires liberation from dogmatic extremism and engagement with modern knowledge, moral sensibility, and religious experience. As Broad Church Anglicans, we embrace comprehensiveness that includes diverse perspectives while emphasizing reason, tolerance, and Christianity's ethical dimensions over metaphysical speculation. F.D. Maurice and the Cambridge Platonists model our approach—emphasizing God's universal love, human dignity, and progressive social reform.

The free will debate, historically, has generated more heat than light. Rigid Calvinism's predestinarianism conflicts with moral sensibility and divine justice. How can God justly condemn persons for inability imposed by divine decree? Conversely, Pelagian optimism ignores the social, psychological, and biological factors constraining choice. Our task is synthesizing legitimate insights from both positions while transcending their limitations.

Benjamin Jowett's influence helps here. He taught that Scripture must be read like any other book—historically, critically, with attention to context and development. The extreme statements about divine sovereignty in Romans or human depravity in Ephesians reflect Paul's particular theological framework and ancient worldview, not timeless metaphysical truth. Jesus's ethical teachings, emphasizing human responsibility and moral choice, provide better foundation.

Modern science illuminates this question. Psychology reveals unconscious motivations, social sciences show cultural conditioning's power, neuroscience demonstrates biological constraints on behavior. These factors significantly influence decisions without eliminating agency altogether. Freedom exists not as absolute autonomy but as limited self-determination within multiple constraining factors.

William Temple's Christian humanism represents our tradition well. He affirmed human dignity, social responsibility, and moral progress while acknowledging sin's reality. His emphasis on incarnational theology—God's presence in all creation, especially in human nature—resists both Calvinist pessimism about humanity and Liberal optimism ignoring evil's reality.

The Essays and Reviews controversy illustrated our commitment to intellectual honesty over dogmatic conformity. We refuse to maintain doctrines contradicting reason, science, or moral consciousness merely because tradition mandates them. If predestinarian determinism contradicts justice and morality, we must revise it, regardless of Augustine's or Calvin's authority.

Our comprehensive approach includes diverse viewpoints. Some Broad Churchmen lean more conservative on grace and predestination; others emphasize human potential and universal salvation. This diversity enriches rather than threatens unity. Doctrinal precision matters less than ethical commitment, spiritual openness, and social engagement.

The social gospel emerges naturally from our emphasis on free moral agency. If humans can choose justice or injustice, Christians must work for social reform—improving working conditions, expanding suffrage, promoting education, and advancing peace. Christian Socialism, championed by Maurice and Charles Kingsley, assumes human capacity for moral progress through cooperation with divine purposes.

Critics charge we abandon orthodoxy for cultural accommodation. We respond that we're being faithful to Christ's moral teachings while being honest about modern knowledge. We won't maintain doctrines that contradict reason or morality merely to preserve theological systems.

Our answer: Yes, humans possess meaningful though limited freedom. Biological, psychological, and social factors constrain choices without eliminating moral agency. Christianity's value lies in its ethical teachings and inspiration toward moral progress, both presupposing genuine human capacity for moral choice. We must exercise this freedom toward justice, compassion, and social reform, cooperating with God's purposes for humanity's advancement.

*** 1.16.26 ANGLICAN (ANGLO-CATHOLIC) Response

Do we have free will? This question finds its proper answer within the fullness of Catholic faith and practice preserved in the Anglican Church through unbroken apostolic succession, sacramental system, and devotion to Our Lady and the Saints. As Anglo-Catholics, we hold firmly to the Catholic tradition shared with Rome and Orthodoxy, rejecting Protestant novelties while affirming our Anglican identity within the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.

The Oxford Movement recovered authentic Catholic doctrine after centuries of Protestant corruption. John Henry Newman (before his lamentable submission to Roman errors), Edward Bouverie Pusey, and John Keble taught us that Anglicanism isn't Protestant but Catholic—the Catholic Church in England, reformed of certain medieval abuses but maintaining essential doctrine and practice.

Our sacramental theology is foundational. The seven sacraments are divinely instituted channels of grace. In Baptism, the soul receives indelible character, original sin is washed away, and sanctifying grace is infused. This grace enables cooperation with God's further gifts. The baptized person, even the infant, has received objective transformation that will enable subsequent faithful response.

The Holy Eucharist, the true Sacrifice of the Mass, continually renews grace. We affirm the Real Presence—Christ's Body and Blood truly present under the accidents of bread and wine. Reception of the Blessed Sacrament nourishes the soul spiritually, strengthening the will toward holiness. Frequent confession and communion transform character progressively.

Our devotional life supports this theology. We practice auricular confession, directed spiritual reading, the Rosary, prayers to Our Lady and the saints, and participation in the full liturgical cycle. These practices presuppose free cooperation with grace. The penitent freely approaches the confessional, examines conscience, confesses sins, receives absolution, and performs penance. Each step involves genuine choice enabled by grace.

The Caroline Divines and Tractarians rejected Calvinist determinism as Protestant error. Lancelot Andrewes, William Laud, and later Pusey all taught synergism—God's grace and human will cooperating. This is the patristic and medieval consensus, maintained by Catholics against Protestant innovations.

We reverence the Fathers—Athanasius, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Augustine (rightly understood), Jerome, and later Thomas Aquinas. The Eastern Fathers especially emphasized human freedom's restoration through grace. The Western tendency toward predestinarianism, unfortunately prominent in Augustine's anti-Pelagian works, found unhealthy flowering in Protestantism.

Thomas Aquinas provides philosophical clarity. He distinguished between primary and secondary causation. God, as primary cause, works through secondary causes—including human will—without destroying their proper causality. Divine providence and human freedom aren't competitors but operate on different levels. God's infallible foreknowledge and governance don't eliminate creaturely freedom but establish it.

The religious life exemplifies this. Monastics freely choose vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Communities like Walsingham, Cowley, and others demonstrate that redeemed persons genuinely choose extraordinary holiness. This requires both divine vocation (grace) and human response (freedom).

Marian devotion illustrates our theology beautifully. The Blessed Virgin Mary freely consented to the Incarnation—"Be it unto me according to thy word." Her "fiat" was genuine choice, enabled by grace (the Immaculate Conception preserving her from original sin), producing history's most consequential human decision. We imitate her willing cooperation with divine purposes.

Critics, especially Evangelicals, charge we've abandoned Protestantism for Rome. We respond that Anglicanism was never truly Protestant. The English Reformation reformed abuses while maintaining Catholic substance. We are simply being faithful to our Catholic heritage.

Our answer: Free will, lost in Adam, is restored through sacramental grace. The baptized possess real freedom to cooperate with grace or resist it. Salvation requires both divine initiative and human response, perfectly united in the sacramental life, directed spiritual practice, and willing cooperation with the Church's sanctifying ministry.

*** 1.16.27 BAPTIST (CALVINIST) Response

Do we have free will? The Scriptures alone must answer this question, and they declare unequivocally that fallen humanity is enslaved to sin, incapable of choosing God without sovereign, regenerating grace. As Calvinist Baptists, we stand with the London Baptist Confession of 1689, which faithfully articulates Reformed soteriology while maintaining Baptist distinctives—believer's baptism, congregational polity, and soul liberty.

Chapter 9 of our Confession states clearly: "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto." This is biblical doctrine, taught in Romans 3, Ephesians 2, John 6, and throughout Scripture.

We differ from Presbyterian brethren primarily regarding baptism and church government, not regarding sovereignty and grace. We fully embrace the Doctrines of Grace—total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and perseverance of the saints. These aren't Calvinist inventions but biblical truths recognized by Augustine, affirmed by the Reformers, and systematized at Dort.

Charles Spurgeon, the Prince of Preachers, exemplified our tradition. He preached Calvinism passionately while evangelizing zealously. How? Because God commands gospel proclamation, and his sovereign purpose accomplishes salvation through appointed means—preaching. The elect will certainly come because God ensures it. Spurgeon's massive Metropolitan Tabernacle conversions demonstrated that Calvinism produces evangelistic fervor, not apathy.

John Gill's "Cause of God and Truth" defended these doctrines against Arminian objections. He demonstrated from Scripture that election precedes faith, regeneration precedes believing, and God's grace creates willing response without violating the will. The Spirit doesn't force unwilling persons to believe but changes hearts so they willingly, eagerly embrace Christ.

Our Baptist identity matters. We reject infant baptism because saving faith must precede baptism. This presupposes that only those whom the Spirit has regenerated can exercise saving faith. Infants cannot believe; therefore, only converted believers should be baptized. Infant baptism compromises both grace's necessity and faith's requirement.

Regeneration must precede faith. This is crucial. Arminians claim faith causes regeneration; we affirm Scripture's teaching that regeneration causes faith. The dead sinner cannot choose life; God must first grant spiritual life. Then, and only then, the regenerated person believes. Faith is gift (Ephesians 2:8-9), not meritorious work.

Contemporary Reformed Baptists—John Piper, Al Mohler, Tom Nettles, others—continue this tradition faithfully. We maintain rigorous biblical exposition, defend doctrinal precision, and practice church discipline. Our soteriology produces serious discipleship because those sovereignly saved will necessarily persevere in holiness.

We distinguish ourselves from hyper-Calvinism, which denies duty to evangelize. We affirm that all hearers have duty to repent and believe, even though only the elect can and will. God sincerely commands what only grace enables. This isn't contradiction but mystery appropriate to creature-Creator distinction.

The free offer of the gospel is genuine. We truly offer Christ to all hearers. God's secret decree and revealed will operate on different levels. We proclaim "whosoever will may come," knowing that the elect will certainly come and others cannot. This paradox doesn't trouble us; it glorifies sovereign grace.

Church membership requires credible profession of regeneration. We examine candidates carefully, admit cautiously, and discipline when necessary. This high view of church membership flows from our Calvinism—true Christians will evidence regeneration through faith and holiness.

Our answer: No free will exists regarding salvation. Fallen humanity is totally depraved, spiritually dead, enslaved to sin. Only sovereign, irresistible grace regenerates, creating faith and willing response. God receives all glory; no human contribution taints salvation's source or accomplishment.

*** 1.16.28 BAPTIST (ARMINIAN) Response

Do we have free will? Yes, in the sense that God's gracious offer of salvation extends genuinely to all persons, and each person can truly accept or reject Christ. As Arminian Baptists, we affirm both human responsibility and divine grace, believing Scripture teaches that God desires all to be saved and that Christ died for everyone, not merely an elect few. This produces passionate evangelism and missionary zeal because we know that salvation is truly available to every hearer.

Our General Baptist heritage, dating to John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, predates the Particular (Calvinist) Baptists. We maintained from the beginning that Christ's atonement is general (universal in scope) not particular (limited to the elect). Scripture clearly states that Christ is "the Savior of the world" (John 4:42), that he "died for all" (2 Corinthians 5:15), and that God "desires all people to be saved" (1 Timothy 2:4).

The Free Will Baptist tradition in America, though distinct organizationally from General Baptists, shares our Arminian convictions. We believe that election is conditional upon foreseen faith, that grace can be resisted, and that genuine believers can fall from grace through unbelief. These aren't novel doctrines but biblical teachings maintained by the early church before Augustine's anti-Pelagian writings introduced deterministic elements.

We affirm total depravity but understand it differently than Calvinists. Sin has corrupted all human faculties, and no one naturally seeks God. However, God provides gracious ability to respond to the gospel—what Wesleyans call prevenient grace. This grace, given through Christ's atonement and the Spirit's work, enables persons to accept or reject God's offer. We aren't Pelagians claiming natural ability; we affirm grace's absolute necessity while denying its irresistibility.

Our evangelistic fervor flows from this theology. When we preach, we genuinely offer salvation to all hearers, knowing Christ died for each person present. We aren't play-acting, as if offering something available only to secret elect. God truly desires every listener's salvation; Christ truly provided atonement for all; the Spirit truly enables response. Whether persons believe depends on their free choice, enabled by grace.

Believer's baptism presupposes free acceptance of Christ. We baptize only those who have personally professed faith in Jesus. This decision is genuine—grace-enabled but not grace-compelled. The baptismal candidate has freely chosen to follow Christ, though this choice was possible only through grace that could have been resisted.

Security of the believer differs in our view. Calvinists affirm unconditional eternal security—once saved, always saved. We believe genuine Christians can fall away through persistent unbelief or willful sin. Warnings throughout Scripture—Hebrews 6, 2 Peter 2, Galatians 5:4—make no sense if apostasy is impossible. We emphasize perseverance in faith and holiness, not presuming on God's grace.

Our church polity reflects this theology. Congregational governance assumes each member's spiritual competency under Christ's lordship. We affirm soul liberty—each person stands individually accountable before God, with direct access through Christ without human mediators. This requires genuine freedom of conscience and will.

Critics charge we compromise grace's sufficiency and God's sovereignty. We respond that we exalt both by showing God sovereignly chose to make salvation universally available and to respect human response. God's power is demonstrated not in overwhelming unwilling persons but in persuading through love while honoring free agency.

Our missiology is crucial. We send missionaries worldwide because we believe every person can be saved if they believe. Calvinist missions face the awkward question: what if only non-elect are present? We have no such problem—Christ died for all hearers.

Our answer: Yes, we have free will in the sense that God's grace enables genuine response to the gospel. This isn't natural ability but grace-enabled capacity. God offers salvation sincerely to all; Christ died for everyone; each person can accept or reject this offer. Salvation requires both divine initiative and human response.

*** 1.16.29 BAPTIST (LANDMARKIST) Response

Do we have free will? This question, like all theological matters, must be answered within the true church—Baptist churches maintaining apostolic succession through baptism since John the Baptist. As Landmarkist Baptists, we affirm that free will exists in the sense that individuals freely choose to accept or reject the gospel, but we emphasize that true salvation and baptism occur only through genuine Baptist churches, not through Protestant denominations or Roman Catholic/Orthodox apostasy.

J.R. Graves articulated our position: only Baptist churches are true churches because only we maintain the correct form (immersion), subjects (believers only), and administrator (properly baptized administrator in valid church succession). This isn't peripheral but essential. Invalid baptism means invalid church membership; invalid church membership means no proper access to the ordinances; improper ordinance administration brings divine judgment, not grace.

The Great Commission's "baptizing them" requires proper authority. Christ gave this commission to the church he established, which has continued through Baptist succession. When someone "accepts Christ" outside a valid Baptist church context, they haven't fully obeyed the gospel until they're properly baptized in a true church by a properly baptized administrator.

Our soteriology tends Arminian—we believe individuals freely respond to gospel preaching. However, this response must issue in baptism by immersion, administered by a Baptist church, to be valid. We reject both Calvinist determinism (which undermines evangelistic urgency) and loose evangelicalism (which considers denominational distinctions unimportant).

We practice "close communion" or "closed communion"—only members of our local Baptist church, or members of like-faith-and-order Baptist churches in fellowship with us, may partake of the Lord's Supper. This isn't uncharitable but biblical. The ordinances belong to the church; proper church membership requires proper baptism; proper baptism requires proper administration.

"Alien immersion" is a crucial concept. If someone was immersed in a Methodist, Presbyterian, or even some Baptist churches that don't maintain proper standards, that baptism is invalid. Upon joining our church, they must be re-baptized (or properly baptized for the first time) to have valid church membership.

This affects the free will question practically. Yes, individuals freely hear the gospel and respond. However, their response must culminate in proper baptism and church membership. Otherwise, they remain outside the covenant community, lacking access to the ordinances through which grace flows. Free will includes responsibility to identify and join true churches.

We're often accused of ecclesiological arrogance. We respond that we're simply maintaining biblical standards. Would God establish his church without visible continuity? If church authority matters—and Scripture shows it does—then valid succession matters. Baptist churches alone maintain this validity.

Our evangelism emphasizes not merely "accepting Jesus" but joining the true church. We don't recognize conversions that don't issue in Baptist baptism and membership. This may seem narrow, but truth is narrow. Jesus said the way is narrow and few find it.

We reject the modern evangelical notion that any sincere Christian profession suffices regardless of church connection. The New Testament knows nothing of churchless Christianity. Baptism and church membership aren't optional additions to salvation but integral components of obedient faith.

Some Landmarkists lean more Calvinist, emphasizing that God's sovereign election ensures the true church's perpetuity. Others lean Arminian, stressing individual responsibility to identify and join true churches. Both groups agree on Baptist church exclusivity.

Our view produces serious commitment. Church membership isn't casual association but covenantal commitment to a specific local congregation. We practice church discipline rigorously because membership is sacred trust, not mere preference.

Critics within broader Baptist life accuse us of sectarianism and theological distortion. We respond that we're recovering New Testament Christianity and Baptist distinctives that others have compromised through ecumenical accommodation.

Our answer: Yes, individuals possess free will to accept or reject the gospel. However, this freedom includes responsibility to be properly baptized and join true churches—Baptist churches maintaining apostolic succession. Salvation and proper church connection are inseparable; one cannot claim to follow Christ while ignoring his church's proper form.

*** 1.16.30 BAPTIST (METHODIST/WESLEYAN) Response

Do we have free will? Yes, in the crucial sense that God's prevenient grace restores sufficient freedom to respond to the gospel, and this response determines one's eternal destiny. As Wesleyan Methodists, we stand firmly with John Wesley's Arminian theology, emphasizing universal atonement, resistible grace, and the necessity of holy living as evidence of genuine salvation. Our distinctive emphasis on entire sanctification and Christian perfection presupposes significant free cooperation with grace throughout the Christian life.

John Wesley's opposition to Calvinist predestinarianism shaped Methodism's identity. He preached that Christ died for all, that grace is truly offered to all, and that individuals can accept or resist this offer. His sermon "Free Grace" forcefully argued that Calvinist election contradicts God's justice, love, and revealed character. If God unconditionally predestines some to damnation, he becomes arbitrary tyrant, not loving Father.

Prevenient grace is foundational to our understanding. This grace—which "goes before" saving grace—is universally given through Christ's atonement. It partially restores human capacity, enabling persons to respond to the gospel though not compelling response. This is why we can preach to all with confidence that genuine salvation is truly available to every hearer, not merely offered hypothetically to secretly elect persons.

Our Arminian Articles of Religion (modified from the Anglican Thirty-Nine Articles) state that we "are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings." We affirm justification by faith alone while insisting this faith is genuine human response enabled by grace, not irresistibly produced by grace.

The distinctive Wesleyan emphasis on entire sanctification crucially involves free will. After justification, believers should pursue full sanctification—cleansing from inbred sin and perfection in love. This requires vigorous cooperation with grace through spiritual disciplines, accountability structures (class meetings), and constant vigilance against sin. Wesley taught that Christians can be "perfected in love" in this life, freed from willful sin, though not from mistakes or infirmities.

This sanctification theology presupposes significant freedom. The justified believer chooses to pursue holiness or remain content with mere forgiveness. Growth in grace requires disciplined effort—prayer, Bible study, fasting, Christian fellowship, works of mercy. These are free choices, though enabled by grace. The believer can also choose to backslide, grieving the Spirit and potentially falling from grace entirely.

We differ from Calvinist Baptists on perseverance. They affirm unconditional eternal security; we teach conditional security. Genuine believers can fall away through persistent unbelief or willful sin. This isn't losing salvation accidentally but deliberately rejecting Christ. However, it's genuinely possible, which is why Scripture contains numerous warnings. This possibility makes holy living urgent, not optional.

Our altar call methodology reflects this theology. We invite seekers to come forward, kneel, pray, and exercise faith. This physical response symbolizes free choice—accepting Christ, consecrating to holy living, or seeking entire sanctification. Critics call this manipulative emotionalism; we call it biblical invitation requiring visible, voluntary response.

Class meetings and accountability structures demonstrate free cooperation with sanctifying grace. Members freely submit to mutual examination, confess struggles, encourage growth, and hold each other accountable. This structured pursuit of holiness assumes genuine agency in progressive sanctification.

Holiness camp meetings, a distinctly Methodist contribution, create intensive environments for seeking entire sanctification. Attendees freely choose to attend, participate in services, seek at the altar, and consecrate themselves fully to God. Many testify to experiencing "second blessing"—entire sanctification as crisis experience following conversion.

Our missiology is aggressive because we believe everyone can be saved. Methodist circuit riders carried the gospel to American frontiers, establishing churches and calling sinners to repentance. This zeal flowed from confidence that Christ died for all and that any hearer could respond.

Our answer: Yes, we have free will in the crucial senses—enabled by prevenient grace to accept or reject salvation initially, and empowered by sanctifying grace to pursue holiness or remain carnal subsequently. God's grace is necessary throughout but never irresistible. Human response, freely given though grace-enabled, determines both eternal destiny and sanctification's degree.
