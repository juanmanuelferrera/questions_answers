*** 1.19.31 Armenian Orthodox Response

The Armenian Apostolic Church maintains that space and time are created realities contingent upon God's eternal will, neither existing independently of matter nor possessing autonomous ontological status apart from divine sustenance. This position reflects the Church's synthesis of Cappadocian patristic theology with distinctive Armenian theological developments, particularly emphasizing creation's total dependence on the uncreated divine essence.

Historically, this understanding developed through the fifth-century theological articulations of Catholicos Hovhannes I Mandakuni and the seventh-century philosopher Anania Shirakatsi, who addressed cosmological questions while defending Chalcedonian Christology against Monophysite accusations. The definitive formulation emerged in the medieval commentaries of Grigor Tatevatsi (1346-1409), whose *Girk Harcʿmancʿ* (Book of Questions) systematically addressed the relationship between created temporal-spatial reality and divine eternity.

The philosophical framework employs the Cappadocian distinction between divine *ousia* (essence) and created *ktisis* (creation). Gregory of Narek's mystical theology emphasizes that God's creative act instantiated both material substance and its necessary conditions—space (*teghagrutʿiwn*) and time (*zhamanak*)—simultaneously. These dimensions possess no reality independent of the matter they contain, as demonstrated in Exodus 3:14, where God's self-revelation as "I AM" establishes the radical contingency of all that receives existence from divine will. Job 38:4-7 illustrates that spatial-temporal frameworks emerged with creation's foundation, not as pre-existing containers.

Significant internal variation exists between the more Platonic inclinations of early medieval Armenian theologians and the Aristotelian-influenced scholasticism of later thinkers like Yovhannes Erznkatsi. The former emphasized space-time's ideational pre-existence in divine foreknowledge; the latter stressed their actualization only through material instantiation.

Buddhist absolutist positions positing space-time as independent dharmas challenge this view, as do certain Islamic *falsafa* arguments for eternal temporal succession. Armenian theologians counter that such positions compromise divine sovereignty and creation's radical contingency.

Contemporary Armenian Orthodox cosmology engages relativistic physics, interpreting Einstein's space-time continuum as confirming patristic insights regarding the inseparability of spatial-temporal dimensions from material reality. Metropolitan Karekin Sarkissian's theological work demonstrates compatibility between Gregory of Narek's participatory metaphysics and contemporary understandings of space-time as relational rather than substantival.

Comparative analysis reveals proximity to Cappadocian positions while diverging from Augustinian frameworks that grant greater conceptual independence to temporal succession. The Armenian emphasis on *zhamanakayin ktisis* (temporal creation) as wholly contingent reality resonates with Thomistic analogical predication but maintains distinctive apophatic dimensions inherited from Pseudo-Dionysius, whose works profoundly influenced Armenian theological development through early translations into classical Armenian.

*** 1.19.32 Syrian Orthodox Response

The Syriac Orthodox tradition affirms that space and time are created dimensions inseparable from material existence, possessing no independent reality beyond God's creative and sustaining action. This position emerges from the Church's Antiochene theological heritage, particularly the metaphysical realism of Ephrem the Syrian, which rejects both Platonic idealism regarding pre-existent forms and materialist claims for autonomous spatial-temporal dimensions.

The historical development began with Ephrem the Syrian's fourth-century hymnic theology, where creation (*bryātā*) encompasses all contingent reality including its spatial (*atrā*) and temporal (*zabnā*) properties. Jacob of Serugh (451-521) elaborated this through his *mēmrē* (metrical homilies), emphasizing that God's creative word simultaneously produces substance and the relational framework enabling material interaction. The definitive Syrian Orthodox formulation emerged in Bar Hebraeus's thirteenth-century synthesis *Maktbānut Ḥekmtā* (Book of the Dove), integrating Aristotelian natural philosophy with patristic theology.

Philosophically, Syrian Orthodox thought employs the concept of *qnomā* (concrete particularity) versus *kyānā* (abstract nature) to demonstrate that space and time possess reality only as accidents (*gaddāšē*) of created substances, never as independent substrata. Ephrem's commentary on Genesis 1:1 ("In the beginning") emphasizes that temporality itself begins with creation, as expressed in his *Hymns on Paradise*: "Before creation, there was no 'when,' for time was born with beings." The Wisdom of Solomon 11:20, affirming God "arranged all things by measure and number and weight," demonstrates spatial-temporal ordering as divine creative activity rather than pre-existing framework.

Internal diversity exists between earlier theologians who emphasized apophatic theology regarding God's relationship to space-time and later scholastic figures influenced by Aristotelian categories. Philoxenos of Mabbug maintained stricter incomparability between divine eternity and creaturely temporality, while Bar Hebraeus explored analogical relationships.

Islamic atomist positions (kalām) proposing discrete spatial-temporal quanta independent of continuous material substance challenge this synthesis. Syrian Orthodox theologians respond that such atomism undermines natural causation's intelligibility and contradicts biblical affirmations of creation's ordered coherence.

Contemporary Syriac Orthodox theology, particularly through Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas's writings, engages quantum mechanics and relativistic physics as confirming the relational nature of space-time rather than substantival independence. This resonates with contemporary physics' understanding of space-time as geometric property of matter-energy distribution rather than independent container.

Comparatively, the Syrian position shares the Cappadocian emphasis on creation's radical contingency while maintaining Ephrem's distinctive typological hermeneutics (*rāzā w-ṭeḥsā*, mystery and symbol) that interprets spatial-temporal reality as revealing divine pedagogical purposes. This differs from Augustinian psychological analogies for time while agreeing on its created status and ontological dependence.

*** 1.19.33 Assyrian Church of the East Response

The Assyrian Church of the East maintains that space and time are created accidents of material substance, possessing no independent existence apart from the corporeal reality they measure and organize. This understanding reflects the Church's Antiochene theological heritage and distinctive Christological framework developed by Theodore of Mopsuestia and systematized by Nestorius, emphasizing the concrete particularity of created realities against abstract speculation.

Historically, this position developed through the East Syrian theological tradition preserved in the School of Nisibis, particularly through the sixth-century commentaries of Narsai and the seventh-century systematic theology of Babai the Great. The *Book of the Union* attributed to Babai explicitly addresses cosmological questions, affirming that God's creative act establishes both material substances (*'īṯūṯā*) and their necessary relational properties including spatial extension (*rūmā*) and temporal succession (*zabnā*). The medieval systematization by ʿAbdishoʿ bar Berika in his *Marganita* (Pearl) provides definitive articulation within scholastic categories.

Philosophically, East Syrian thought employs the fundamental distinction between *kyānā* (nature) and *qnomā* (hypostasis or concrete instantiation) to demonstrate that space and time lack independent hypostatic reality. They exist as measures (*mšūḥtā*) of material processes rather than independent containers. Theodore's commentary on Genesis emphasizes that "In the beginning" signifies the commencement of temporality itself, as God's eternal existence transcends temporal succession. Psalm 90:2 ("Before the mountains were born... from everlasting to everlasting you are God") demonstrates the ontological distinction between divine eternity and created temporality, the latter possessing no existence independent of created substances.

Significant internal variation exists between earlier theologians who emphasized radical divine transcendence and later figures who engaged more extensively with Aristotelian natural philosophy through Islamic intermediaries. Timothy I's eighth-century dialogues with Caliph al-Mahdi reveal sophisticated engagement with Islamic cosmological arguments while maintaining distinctive Christian positions.

Buddhist teachings on *śūnyatā* (emptiness) potentially supporting space-time independence from material form present philosophical challenges. East Syrian theologians respond by emphasizing that biblical creation theology affirms the goodness and substantiality of material reality against any dissolution into empty spatial-temporal frameworks.

Contemporary Assyrian theological reflection, particularly through Mar Dinkha IV's encyclicals, interprets modern physics' understanding of space-time relativity as confirming traditional East Syrian insights regarding the inseparability of spatial-temporal dimensions from material energy. This resonates with relational interpretations of quantum field theory.

Comparatively, the Assyrian position shares the broader patristic consensus on creation's contingency while distinctively emphasizing concrete particularity (*qnomā*) over universal abstractions, reflecting Christological commitments. This differs from Western scholastic tendencies toward reifying philosophical categories while maintaining substantial agreement on space-time's ontological dependence upon material creation.

*** 1.19.34 Chaldean Catholic Response

The Chaldean Catholic Church, united with Rome while preserving East Syriac theological and liturgical traditions, teaches that space and time are created dimensions lacking independent existence apart from material reality, wholly contingent upon God's creative and providential action. This position integrates the Church's Antiochene patristic heritage with Thomistic metaphysics received through union with Rome in 1553, creating a distinctive synthesis that honors both Eastern and Western theological patrimony.

Historically, Chaldean theology preserved the East Syrian tradition of Theodore of Mopsuestia and the School of Nisibis while gradually incorporating Latin scholastic categories following union. Patriarch Yohannan Hormizd (1830-1838) initiated systematic integration of Thomistic philosophy with traditional East Syrian theology, a project continued by Joseph ʿAudo's nineteenth-century theological manuals. The twentieth century witnessed sophisticated synthesis through scholars like Patriarch Paul II Cheikho, whose writings harmonize patristic and scholastic approaches to cosmology.

Philosophically, the Chaldean position employs both the East Syrian distinction between *kyānā* (nature) and *qnomā* (hypostasis) and the Thomistic act-potency framework to demonstrate space-time's accidental rather than substantial character. Space (*rūmā*) and time (*zabnā*) exist as quantitative accidents measuring material extension and succession, requiring substance for their actualization. Genesis 1:1 establishes creation's absolute beginning, necessarily including the temporal dimension itself, as Augustine recognized in *Confessions* XI. Wisdom 11:20's affirmation that God "arranged all things by measure" indicates spatial-temporal ordering as divine creative activity rather than pre-existing framework.

Internal diversity exists between theologians emphasizing Eastern apophatic approaches to divine transcendence and those favoring Western analogical predication. Some Chaldean scholars maintain stricter East Syrian positions on radical divine incomparability, while others embrace more extensive philosophical speculation characteristic of Latin scholasticism.

Process theology's proposal that temporal succession belongs to divine experience itself challenges traditional Chaldean metaphysics. Chaldean theologians respond by affirming divine timelessness while acknowledging God's free engagement with temporal creation through incarnation and sacramental presence, following both Cyrillian and Thomistic Christological frameworks.

Contemporary Chaldean theology, articulated through institutions like the Babel College for Philosophy and Theology, engages relativistic physics as confirming the relational nature of space-time. Scholars interpret Einstein's demonstration that spatial-temporal metrics depend upon matter-energy distribution as vindicating both patristic and scholastic insights regarding space-time's ontological dependence.

Comparatively, the Chaldean synthesis occupies a unique position bridging Eastern and Western approaches. While sharing the broader Christian consensus on creation's contingency, the Chaldean integration of Thomistic substantial form with East Syrian concrete hypostasis (*qnomā*) creates distinctive perspectives. This differs from purely Latin approaches while transcending simple preservation of Eastern tradition through creative synthesis that honors both theological patrimonies.

*** 1.19.35 Maronite Catholic Response

The Maronite Catholic Church teaches that space and time are created realities fundamentally dependent upon material substance and God's sustaining power, possessing no autonomous existence independent of the physical cosmos. This position reflects the Maronite synthesis of Antiochene patristic theology, particularly Syriac spiritual traditions, with Latin scholastic metaphysics following reunion with Rome in the twelfth century.

Historically, Maronite cosmological understanding developed through distinctive channels. Early Maronite theology, preserved in the monastery of Saint Maron and subsequent Lebanese mountain communities, emphasized the mystical dimensions of creation's relationship to the Creator, drawing heavily from Ephrem the Syrian's symbolic theology. Following communion with Rome, particularly after the 1580s establishment of the Maronite College in Rome, Latin scholastic categories were integrated. The eighteenth-century Maronite scholars Joseph Simeon Assemani and his nephew produced sophisticated syntheses harmonizing Eastern and Western perspectives. Patriarch Estephan Douaihy's (1670-1704) theological writings represent the mature integration period.

Philosophically, Maronite theology employs both Syriac concepts of *bryātā* (creation) as total divine production and Thomistic distinctions between substance and accidents. Space (*metrūḥā*) and time (*zebnā*) function as quantities measuring material extension and duration, requiring substantial being for actualization. The creation account in Genesis 1:1 establishes temporal beginning itself, as emphasized in Basil's *Hexaemeron*, influential in Syriac tradition. Psalm 102:25-27, contrasting divine immutability with created mutability, demonstrates that temporal succession characterizes creatures rather than existing independently.

Internal diversity exists between theologians trained primarily in Eastern monasteries preserving Syriac mystical theology and those educated in Rome who emphasize systematic scholastic approaches. Nineteenth-century debates between traditionalists and reformers reflected these tensions, with figures like Patriarch Paul Massad seeking balance.

Modern physics' block universe interpretation potentially supporting space-time's independent four-dimensional reality challenges traditional Maronite metaphysics. Maronite philosophers respond that even four-dimensional space-time manifolds require material-energetic content for geometric structure, as general relativity demonstrates.

Contemporary Maronite theology, articulated through institutions like Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, engages scientific cosmology while maintaining theological commitments. Scholars interpret quantum field theory's understanding of space-time as emergent from more fundamental quantum realities as consonant with traditional affirmations of space-time's derivative rather than primary ontological status.

Comparatively, the Maronite position represents unique Eastern Catholic synthesis. While sharing Latin scholastic frameworks through Roman connection, Maronite theology preserves distinctive Syriac emphases on symbolic interpretation (*rāzā*) and apophatic mysticism. This creates perspectives differing from purely Latin or purely Eastern approaches, exemplifying how communion with Rome need not eliminate legitimate theological diversity. The Maronite integration particularly emphasizes creation's sacramental character, viewing spatial-temporal reality as revealing divine glory rather than merely philosophical categories.

*** 1.19.36 Melkite Catholic Response

The Melkite Greek Catholic Church maintains that space and time are created dimensions wholly dependent upon material reality and divine creative action, lacking autonomous existence independent of corporeal substances. This position reflects the Church's Byzantine theological heritage, particularly Cappadocian metaphysics and Maximian cosmology, integrated with Latin scholastic categories following union with Rome in 1724.

Historically, Melkite cosmological understanding developed through the broader Byzantine theological tradition. The Cappadocian Fathers established foundational principles: creation's radical contingency, the simultaneity of material substance with its spatial-temporal properties, and divine transcendence beyond all creaturely categories including time. Maximus the Confessor's seventh-century cosmic Christology elaborated creation's *logoi* (divine intentions) as establishing spatial-temporal frameworks for material being. Following union with Rome, Melkite theologians integrated these perspectives with Thomistic metaphysics, as evidenced in Patriarch Cyril VI Tanas's eighteenth-century writings harmonizing Eastern and Western cosmologies.

Philosophically, Melkite theology employs the Byzantine synthesis of Platonic participation and Aristotelian hylomorphism. Space (*τόπος*, *topos*) and time (*χρόνος*, *chronos*) exist as measures (*μέτρα*, *metra*) of material quantity and succession, requiring substantial being for actualization. Gregory of Nyssa's *On the Making of Man* emphasizes creation's simultaneous production of matter and its necessary conditions. Genesis 1:1's "In the beginning" indicates temporal commencement itself, as John of Damascus systematized in *The Orthodox Faith*. Wisdom 11:20 demonstrates spatial-temporal ordering as divine creative activity rather than pre-existing framework.

Significant internal variation exists between theologians emphasizing apophatic theology and divine simplicity versus those engaging more extensively with systematic metaphysics. Some Melkite scholars maintain stricter limitations on philosophical speculation regarding God's relationship to space-time, while others embrace analogical predication and philosophical theology.

Kantian positions treating space-time as a priori forms of intuition independent of empirical content challenge Melkite realism. Melkite philosophers respond that transcendental idealism undermines creation theology's realist commitments and biblical affirmations of creation's objective goodness independent of human consciousness.

Contemporary Melkite theology, particularly through scholars like Archbishop Cyril Salim Bustros, engages modern physics while maintaining traditional metaphysical commitments. Interpretation of relativistic space-time as geometric property of matter-energy distribution confirms patristic insights regarding space-time's relational rather than absolute character.

Comparatively, the Melkite position occupies distinctive space within Catholic communion. While sharing Latin scholastic frameworks through Roman union, Melkite theology preserves Byzantine emphases on apophatic mysticism, cosmic Christology, and theosis. The integration of Maximian *logoi* theology with Thomistic participation creates perspectives enriching broader Catholic tradition. This differs from purely Latin metaphysical approaches while transcending simple preservation of Byzantine formulae through creative synthesis honoring both theological patrimonies and contributing unique perspectives to contemporary Catholic engagement with cosmological questions.
