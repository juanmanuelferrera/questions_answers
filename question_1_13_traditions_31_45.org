*** 1.13.31 METHODIST (HOLINESS) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? The Holiness tradition, emerging from John Wesley's emphasis on Christian perfection, affirms that truth becomes certain through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. We can know truth with certainty, but this certainty differs profoundly from mere intellectual assent or philosophical speculation.

The heart of our epistemology lies in Wesley's quadrilateral: Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. Scripture provides the foundation, yet truth becomes experientially certain through entire sanctification—what Wesley called "perfect love." This transformative experience purifies the heart, enabling clearer perception of spiritual reality. The sanctified believer doesn't merely believe truth intellectually but knows it through radical heart-transformation.

Consider the testimony meeting, central to Holiness worship. When believers testify to their sanctification experience, they speak with unmistakable certainty. This isn't arrogant presumption but humble confidence rooted in divine encounter. The witness of the Spirit confirms truth internally, creating certainty that transcends rational proof. Phoebe Palmer's altar theology exemplified this: complete consecration leads to immediate assurance, for God cannot lie about His promises.

However, Holiness theology maintains proper epistemic humility. We distinguish between saving truth—which we can know with certainty through God's revelation—and peripheral matters requiring charitable disagreement. The fundamentals of salvation, holiness, and Christ's deity stand as certain; secondary doctrines remain open to continued illumination. This balance prevents both skepticism and dogmatism.

The crisis experience of entire sanctification functions as our certainty anchor. Like Wesley's heart "strangely warmed" at Aldersgate, or Palmer's moment of consecration, these definitive encounters establish truth experientially. Yet we acknowledge growth continues beyond crisis moments. Certainty about salvation and sanctification remains constant while understanding deepens progressively.

Holiness tradition also emphasizes practical fruit as truth's verification. Jesus taught that we know truth by its fruit. Authentic holiness produces Christ-like character—love, joy, peace, patience. When doctrine generates pride, division, or lovelessness, we question whether it represents true knowledge. Certainty manifests not through argumentative victory but through transformed lives radiating divine love.

We reject both rationalistic overconfidence and postmodern relativism. Truth exists objectively in God's character and revelation. Yet finite humans grasp truth most certainly not through autonomous reason but through Spirit-baptized hearts surrendered completely to God. The sanctified intellect, purified from sin's distortions, perceives spiritual reality with remarkable clarity.

In practical terms, Holiness believers pursue truth through prayer, Scripture meditation, testimony, and holy living. We can know truth with certainty—particularly soteriological truth—because God faithfully reveals Himself to purified hearts. This certainty empowers confident proclamation while maintaining loving openness toward those still seeking deeper light. Perfect love casts out fear, including epistemic anxiety.

*** 1.13.32 PENTECOSTAL (CLASSICAL) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Classical Pentecostalism, birthed at Azusa Street and rooted in the baptism of the Holy Spirit with evidence of tongues, declares emphatically: yes, we can know truth with certainty through direct spiritual experience and divine revelation. Our epistemology centers on the immediate, experiential knowledge of God through the Spirit's power.

The Pentecostal answer transcends mere intellectual assent. We distinguish between knowing about God academically and knowing God personally through Spirit-baptism. When believers receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance, they encounter truth with undeniable certainty. This experience isn't subjective fantasy but objective reality confirmed by biblical pattern and spiritual fruit.

Consider the Day of Pentecost itself. The disciples didn't merely believe Jesus had risen; they knew with absolute certainty because the promised Spirit came with power. Tongues, prophecy, and miraculous signs provided verification impossible to doubt. Similarly, modern Pentecostals receive experiential confirmation that validates scriptural truth. The gifts of the Spirit—prophecy, healing, miracles—function as divine authentication.

Our certainty rests on multiple witnesses. First, Scripture provides the foundational truth. However, Scripture comes alive through the Spirit's illumination. Dead letters become living words when the same Spirit who inspired Scripture interprets it to Spirit-filled believers. Second, personal experience confirms scriptural promises. When we pray for healing and witness immediate recovery, certainty replaces theoretical belief. Third, the community of Spirit-baptized believers provides corporate verification. When the same Spirit manifests across diverse contexts, collective experience establishes truth beyond individual delusion.

Classical Pentecostals emphasize subsequence: salvation, then Spirit-baptism, often followed by continued empowerment. Each stage brings deeper certainty. The initial conversion experience establishes salvation truth. Spirit-baptism confirms the Spirit's reality and power. Ongoing manifestations—prophecies that prove accurate, healings that medical professionals verify, deliverances that produce lasting freedom—accumulate evidence strengthening certainty.

Yet we maintain epistemic carefulness. Not every spiritual experience originates from God. Scripture remains the ultimate standard for testing spirits. Manifestations must align with biblical revelation. Prophecies require judging by other Spirit-filled believers. This discernment process prevents fanaticism while preserving genuine pneumatic epistemology.

The Pentecostal emphasis on testimony reflects our experiential certainty. In services, believers share what God has done—healings, provisions, deliverances. These testimonies aren't mere opinions but witnessed events establishing truth publicly. The consistency of testimonies across cultures and generations demonstrates truth's objective reality.

We acknowledge limitations. Complete omniscience belongs to God alone. We "know in part and prophesy in part." Yet partial knowledge doesn't mean uncertain knowledge. We can know truly, if not exhaustively. The Spirit grants sufficient certainty for confident faith and bold evangelism.

Practically, Pentecostals pursue truth through prayer, fasting, worship, and yielding to the Spirit. We can know truth with certainty because the Spirit of truth dwells within, guiding into all truth, confirming God's word through accompanying signs.

*** 1.13.33 PENTECOSTAL (ONENESS) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Oneness Pentecostalism answers affirmatively, grounding certainty in the revealed name of Jesus Christ and the apostolic experience of Acts 2:38. We can know truth with certainty because God has revealed Himself completely in Jesus, and this revelation comes with demonstrable evidence: repentance, baptism in Jesus' name, and Spirit-baptism evidenced by tongues.

Our epistemology centers on the non-negotiable truth of God's singularity manifest in Christ. Against Trinitarianism's philosophical complexity, we affirm the simple, certain truth: Jesus is the one God revealed in flesh. This isn't abstract theology but experiential reality confirmed through apostolic baptism and spiritual power. When believers obey Acts 2:38—repenting, being baptized in Jesus' name for remission of sins, and receiving the Holy Ghost with tongues—they know truth with experiential certainty.

Consider the apostolic pattern. The early church knew truth with absolute certainty because they possessed both the doctrine and the experience. They didn't theorize about God's nature; they encountered the one God in Jesus Christ, baptized converts in His name (never the Trinitarian formula), and witnessed consistent Spirit-baptism with tongues. This pattern establishes certainty: when modern believers replicate apostolic obedience, they receive identical results, confirming truth's objectivity.

The name of Jesus functions as our certainty anchor. Philippians 2:9-10 declares God gave Jesus "a name which is above every name." This isn't a supplemental name but the revelation of God's identity. When we baptize in Jesus' name rather than titles ("Father, Son, Holy Ghost"), we obey revealed truth rather than later tradition. The certainty comes from biblical obedience producing biblical results.

Oneness epistemology emphasizes the necessity of experience. Intellectual agreement alone proves insufficient. One must undergo the complete Acts 2:38 experience to truly know salvation truth. This creates certainty impossible to achieve through mere study. When believers feel their sins washed away in Jesus' name baptism and speak in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance, intellectual doubt evaporates before experiential reality.

However, we distinguish between salvific certainty and peripheral matters. The apostolic doctrine—Jesus' deity, baptism in His name, Spirit-baptism with tongues—stands absolutely certain. Secondary issues allow more flexibility. This distinction prevents both skepticism about core truth and rigidity about non-essentials.

The consistency of Oneness experience across cultures provides corporate verification. Whether in America, Africa, or Asia, when people obey Acts 2:38, they receive the same Spirit with the same evidence. This universal consistency transcends cultural subjectivity, establishing objective truth.

We reject philosophical skepticism as evidence of spiritual blindness. Those who deny certain knowledge often lack the apostolic experience that generates certainty. Oneness believers possess confidence not from intellectual sophistication but from obedient experience aligned with Scripture.

Practically, we pursue truth through scriptural study emphasizing the book of Acts, prayer in Jesus' name, and seeking the complete apostolic experience. We can know truth with certainty because God's revelation in Jesus is clear, and apostolic obedience produces verifiable results that confirm truth experientially and corporately.

*** 1.13.34 PENTECOSTAL (NEO-CHARISMATIC) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? The Neo-Charismatic movement, emphasizing contemporary prophetic revelation, apostolic authority, and kingdom advancement, affirms confident knowledge while embracing progressive revelation. We can know truth with certainty, but this certainty operates dynamically as God continues speaking through prophets, apostles, and spiritual manifestations in the present age.

Our epistemology integrates Scripture with ongoing revelation. The written Word provides the foundation, but the Spirit continues revealing fresh insight for today's context. God hasn't stopped speaking. Modern apostles and prophets receive revelation that, while not contradicting Scripture, provides contemporary application and strategic direction. This creates certainty grounded in both ancient text and present encounter.

Consider the prophetic word given in worship. When a recognized prophet declares "Thus says the Lord," Neo-Charismatics receive this as divine communication carrying certainty when properly judged. We don't approach such words skeptically but expectantly, knowing God speaks today. When prophecies prove accurate—predicted events occur, healings manifest, financial provisions arrive—certainty accumulates through verified experience.

The five-fold ministry (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers) functions as our interpretive community. Apostolic leaders, recognized by spiritual fruit and supernatural confirmation, possess authority to declare truth definitively. This doesn't mean blind submission but recognizing that God establishes leadership structures to guide His people into truth. When apostles speak with divine backing—miracles, accurate prophetic insight, kingdom breakthrough—their teaching carries weight generating certainty.

Neo-Charismatic certainty emphasizes impartation and demonstration. Truth transfers not merely through information but through spiritual impartation. When leaders lay hands on believers, spiritual gifts activate, confirming truth experientially. Signs and wonders accompany authentic gospel preaching, validating the message. We know truth by its power to transform, heal, deliver, and advance God's kingdom.

However, we maintain testing standards. Not every spiritual manifestation originates from God. Not every prophetic word proves accurate. Scripture remains the ultimate plumb line. Prophecies require corporate judging. Leaders must demonstrate Christ-like character alongside spiritual power. This discernment process balances enthusiastic embrace of revelation with necessary caution.

The Strategic Level Spiritual Warfare emphasis reflects our epistemological confidence. We believe God reveals demonic structures over regions, empowering targeted intercession that produces measurable breakthrough. When prayer aligns with revealed strategy, territories transform—crime drops, churches grow, economies improve. These tangible results confirm truth's objective reality.

We acknowledge the controversial nature of contemporary revelation. Critics charge that ongoing prophecy undermines Scripture's sufficiency. We respond that Scripture itself promises continuing prophetic ministry until Christ returns. Proper submission to Scripture while embracing present revelation avoids both dead orthodoxy and ungrounded mysticism.

The testimonial nature of Neo-Charismatic gatherings demonstrates our experiential certainty. Believers share recent prophecies fulfilled, healings received, provisions manifested. These aren't ancient stories but current events establishing truth's present reality.

Practically, Neo-Charismatics pursue truth through passionate worship that invites God's presence, submission to apostolic leadership, eagerness for prophetic words, and expectation of supernatural confirmation. We can know truth with certainty because God actively speaks, demonstrates His power, and establishes apostolic authority to guide His people into kingdom victory.

*** 1.13.35 ANABAPTIST (MENNONITE) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? The Mennonite tradition, rooted in radical reformation and committed to discipleship, answers cautiously yet affirmatively. We can know truth with sufficient certainty for faithful living, though claiming absolute certainty often leads to the very coercion our forebears died resisting. Truth reveals itself most clearly in community discernment, nonviolent love, and simple obedience to Christ's teachings.

Our epistemology emphasizes communal discernment over individual certainty. The Schleitheim Confession and subsequent Anabaptist documents demonstrate truth emerging through gathered believers seeking God's will together. We distrust isolated interpretation, recognizing human fallibility and sin's corrupting influence on perception. When the body of Christ—particularly committed, baptized believers walking in discipleship—discerns together through prayer and Scripture, truth becomes sufficiently clear for faithful practice.

Consider the martyrs' certainty. When our ancestors faced torture and execution rather than recant, they demonstrated profound conviction. Yet their certainty centered not on abstract doctrine but on concrete obedience: refusing violence, practicing believer's baptism, separating church and state, living communally. This practical certainty differs from philosophical certainty. They knew the way of Jesus with enough clarity to die for it.

The Rule of Christ (Matthew 18) illustrates our approach. When conflict arises, the community processes disagreement through patient dialogue, ultimately deferring to collective wisdom. This method presumes truth becomes clear through humble, mutual seeking rather than authoritarian declaration. We can know truth with certainty as the community faithfully practices this discernment process.

Mennonite epistemology profoundly distrusts Constantinian certainty—the confidence that allows truth-claims to justify violence. History reveals how absolute certainty about doctrine led Catholics and Protestants alike to persecute Anabaptists. This traumatic memory shapes our epistemic humility. When someone claims certainty about truth, we ask: "Will you kill for that certainty?" If yes, we question whether they truly know Christ, who refused violence even unto death.

Jesus' Sermon on the Mount provides our certainty anchor. Love enemies, refuse oaths, practice radical generosity, pursue purity and peace—these teachings admit little ambiguity. We can know truth with certainty here because Jesus spoke clearly and His life demonstrated these principles perfectly. The difficulty lies not in knowing but in obeying.

We distinguish between essential truth and disputable matters. The core—Jesus' lordship, believer's baptism, nonviolence, community discernment, separation of church and state—stands firm. Secondary issues require patient dialogue within community bounds. This distinction prevents both paralyzing skepticism and divisive dogmatism.

The two-kingdom theology informs our epistemology. God's kingdom operates by truth principles different from worldly kingdoms. The world seeks certainty through power, control, and coercion. God's kingdom reveals truth through weakness, service, and suffering love. We know truth most certainly when living according to kingdom values produces Jesus-like character.

Practically, Mennonites pursue truth through Scripture reading in community, patient dialogue about application, simple lifestyle reflecting kingdom values, and willingness to suffer rather than compromise. We can know truth with certainty—particularly ethical truth about following Jesus—when the believing community discerns together and embodies what it discovers through costly discipleship and nonviolent love.

*** 1.13.36 ANABAPTIST (AMISH) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? The Amish tradition, preserving Old Order values through Gelassenheit (yieldedness) and Ordnung (community standards), affirms practical certainty rooted in biblical simplicity, community discernment, and proven tradition. We can know truth with certainty sufficient for faithful living, though worldly knowledge claims often reflect pride rather than humble submission to God's clear will.

Our epistemology centers on the sufficiency of Scripture interpreted through community and tradition. God's Word reveals truth plainly to humble, yielded hearts. The complications arise not from truth's obscurity but from prideful intellects seeking innovation rather than obedience. When we submit to Scripture's plain teaching—nonresistance, separation from the world, simplicity, community authority—truth becomes certain enough to order entire lives.

Consider the Ordnung, the unwritten community standards governing dress, technology, and social practice. Each church district discerns these standards through collective wisdom, rooted in biblical principles of separation, humility, and community. The certainty comes not from individual interpretation but from community consensus maintained across generations. When the church discerns together, seeking God's will through prayer and Scripture, truth emerges with practical clarity.

The Martyrs Mirror testifies to our ancestors' certainty. They died rather than violate conscience, confident in Christ's way of peace and believer's baptism. This certainty wasn't philosophical speculation but lived conviction. They knew truth sufficiently to sacrifice everything. This historical testimony validates truth's objective reality—people don't die for uncertain beliefs.

Amish epistemology profoundly distrusts hochmut (pride) and worldly wisdom. Modern education, with its questioning spirit and individual autonomy emphasis, often undermines simple faith. The world demands proof, questions everything, elevates individual judgment. This approach generates confusion rather than clarity. We embrace epistemic humility that accepts biblical teaching without endless questioning. Eight grades of education suffice for godly living; further schooling risks pride corrupting simple faith.

Technology discernment illustrates our method. We don't declare all technology evil or all good. Rather, each community evaluates specific technologies by asking: Will this strengthen or weaken community bonds? Will it promote pride or humility? Will it connect us to worldly values or preserve separation? Through patient discernment, truth emerges about what serves godliness. The consistency of these decisions across Amish communities confirms truth's objectivity.

We distinguish between essential biblical truth and matters of community application. Scripture's core teachings—Jesus' lordship, nonresistance, adult baptism, separation from world—stand absolutely certain. How exactly to apply separation (which technologies, what dress standards) requires community discernment within biblical boundaries. This distinction allows both conviction and flexibility.

The principle of Gelassenheit (yieldedness to God and community) shapes our knowing. Truth reveals itself to yielded hearts, not assertive individuals. When we surrender personal preferences to community wisdom, truth becomes clear. Pride clouds perception; humility clarifies vision.

We reject both worldly skepticism and arrogant dogmatism. Truth exists objectively in God's revelation. Yet claiming absolute certainty about every interpretation reflects pride. We hold core convictions firmly while maintaining humility about our limitations.

Practically, Amish pursue truth through Scripture reading, church counsel, following the Ordnung, maintaining separation from worldly influence, and observing how practices produce fruit across generations. We can know truth with certainty when humble hearts submit to God's Word, community discernment, and proven tradition that has sustained faithful living for centuries.

*** 1.13.37 ANABAPTIST (BRETHREN) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? The Brethren tradition, committed to New Testament pattern, simple living, and peace testimony, affirms practical certainty grounded in scriptural obedience, community discernment, and experiential verification. We can know truth with certainty when we faithfully practice what Jesus and the apostles taught, allowing obedience to confirm understanding.

Our epistemology emphasizes orthopraxy alongside orthodoxy—right practice verifying right belief. The early Brethren, meeting at the Eder River for their first baptism, didn't possess every theological answer. Yet they knew with certainty that believer's baptism by trine immersion reflected New Testament practice. They acted on available light, trusting further truth would emerge through continued obedience. This pragmatic approach characterizes Brethren epistemology: truth becomes certain through faithful practice.

The Annual Meeting (formerly Annual Conference) illustrates corporate discernment. Representatives from congregations gather to address questions through Scripture study, prayer, and consensus-seeking. When the body discerns together, truth emerges with practical clarity. Standing queries—formalized questions about belief and practice—ensure continued examination while maintaining continuity. This method balances innovation and tradition, individual insight and corporate wisdom.

Consider the three ordinances Brethren practice with distinctive understanding: believer's baptism by trine immersion, love feast including foot washing and communion, and anointing the sick with oil. We know these practices with certainty not merely because Scripture mentions them but because generations of obedience have confirmed their spiritual value. When we wash one another's feet, pride dissolves and unity deepens. When we anoint the sick, healing sometimes follows. Experience validates interpretation.

Brethren epistemology deeply values simplicity—the testimony of simple living grounded in Jesus' teaching. Truth reveals itself through uncomplicated obedience rather than philosophical sophistication. When Jesus commands "love your enemies," we don't need elaborate hermeneutics. The meaning stands clear; the challenge lies in obedience. Our certainty about peace testimony comes from straightforward acceptance of Jesus' explicit teaching combined with centuries of faithful practice.

We distinguish between primary truth and secondary matters. The New Testament pattern—believer's baptism, communion, foot washing, nonresistance, simple living, community discernment—stands certain. Peripheral issues allow diversity. Historic Brethren maintained "no creed but the New Testament," avoiding detailed confessions that generate division. This approach reflects confidence about essentials while acknowledging legitimate diversity regarding details.

The Brethren emphasis on education (founding multiple colleges) demonstrates epistemic openness. Unlike some plain groups, we embrace learning while maintaining primary commitment to discipleship. Study illuminates Scripture and world, yet academic knowledge never supersedes simple obedience. We can pursue truth intellectually while remaining grounded in experiential faith.

However, we maintain healthy skepticism toward claims requiring departure from New Testament pattern. When theology justifies violence, materialism, or inequality, we question whether such "truth" aligns with Jesus' way. The fruit test applies: does this understanding produce Christ-like character and community?

Practical Brethren methods include corporate Bible study, consensus discernment through Annual Meeting, practicing the ordinances faithfully, maintaining peace witness, and living simply. We can know truth with certainty particularly regarding ethical behavior and community practice—when we obey what Jesus and the apostles clearly taught and verify understanding through corporate discernment and experiential confirmation across generations.

*** 1.13.38 QUAKER (CONSERVATIVE) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Conservative Quakerism, preserving traditional unprogrammed worship and plain living, affirms certainty grounded in the Inward Light of Christ directly illuminating faithful hearts. We can know truth with certainty through immediate divine revelation confirmed by Scripture, corporate discernment, and transformed living. Truth arrives not through external authority but through inward encounter with the living Christ.

Our epistemology centers on the radical Protestant principle: Christ teaches His people Himself. George Fox's transformative discovery—"There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition"—establishes our approach. Truth becomes certain when the Inward Light illuminates understanding directly. This isn't subjective fancy but objective divine reality, for Christ's Light shines universally, revealing consistent truth to attentive souls.

The unprogrammed meeting for worship demonstrates our method. Friends gather in expectant silence, waiting upon God. When someone speaks, they share only what the Spirit compels. Corporate silence tests each message. If truth, the Light within others witnesses to it, creating unity. If not, the message falls flat. This communal discernment process generates certainty impossible through individual study alone. We trust that Christ genuinely guides His gathered people into truth.

Consider the testimonies—simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, stewardship. These arose not from systematic theology but from faithful Friends' inward guidance confirmed corporately across time. We know with certainty that violence contradicts Christ's nature because the Inward Light consistently reveals this truth to yielded souls. Similarly with simplicity: as Friends attended to the Light, pretense and ostentation proved incompatible with authentic spirituality.

Conservative Friends maintain Scripture's authority while subordinating it to the Spirit who inspired it. The Bible confirms and tests inward revelation but doesn't replace direct encounter with Christ. We read Scripture not as external rule but as secondary testimony to the same Light illuminating our hearts. When the Spirit speaks inwardly and Scripture confirms outwardly, certainty becomes profound.

The clearness committee process illustrates communal epistemology. When Friends face important decisions, they gather trusted members who ask clarifying questions, helping discern God's leading. This process presumes truth becomes clear when we corporately attend to the Light. Individual perception often proves clouded; collective discernment brings clarity.

We distinguish between immediate certainty and ultimate mystery. The Light reveals truth sufficient for faithful living with remarkable clarity. Yet we maintain epistemic humility about our interpretations. What seems clear to us might appear differently to other faithful people. This tension between confidence and humility characterizes Conservative Quaker epistemology.

Plain dress and speech reflect our certainty about simplicity and equality. These practices aren't arbitrary traditions but embodied truth-claims: all people possess equal worth, ostentation dishonors God, integrity requires transparent speech. The consistency of these practices across generations confirms truth's objective nature.

However, we recognize the Light can fade if neglected. Regular worship attendance, patient silence, Scripture reading, and accountable community maintain spiritual sensitivity necessary for perceiving truth clearly. Pride, hurry, and worldliness cloud the Inward Light, diminishing certainty.

Practically, Conservative Friends pursue truth through faithful worship attendance, patient waiting in silence, Scripture study confirming inward guidance, submission to corporate discernment, and daily attending to the Inward Light. We can know truth with certainty because Christ faithfully illuminates yielded hearts, and the worshipping community confirms authentic revelation through Spirit-led discernment and consistent testimony.

*** 1.13.39 QUAKER (LIBERAL) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Liberal Quakerism, embracing diverse theological perspectives while maintaining traditional process, responds carefully: we can know truth experientially and provisionally, though absolute certainty often reflects insufficient humility before mystery. Truth reveals itself progressively through the Light within all people, corporate seeking, and openness to wisdom from multiple sources including science, other faiths, and human experience.

Our epistemology emphasizes continuing revelation over fixed dogma. The Light shines progressively, illuminating truth according to human capacity for receiving it. What early Friends perceived truly yet partially, we continue discovering more fully. This doesn't mean endless relativism but recognition that finite beings grasp infinite truth gradually. George Fox's insight—"I saw also that there was an ocean of darkness and death, but an infinite ocean of light and love, which flowed over the ocean of darkness"—suggests truth's vastness exceeding any generation's full comprehension.

The unprogrammed meeting remains central to Liberal Friends' epistemology, though we interpret it inclusively. When we gather in worship, the Light within each person contributes to collective understanding. Truth emerges not from authoritative declaration but through shared seeking. Messages arise from varied sources—Scripture, poetry, personal experience, silence itself. Corporate discernment evaluates each contribution, not against fixed orthodoxy but through communal wisdom and fruit-bearing.

Consider our evolving testimonies. Early Friends opposed slavery before broader society recognized this truth. Later Friends championed women's equality, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and environmental stewardship as the Light revealed these concerns. This progressive illumination demonstrates truth's dynamic nature. We can know truth with sufficient certainty to act courageously, yet remain open to deeper understanding as the Light continues revealing.

Liberal Quakerism embraces theological pluralism within our community. Some Friends center their faith on Christ; others embrace non-theistic spirituality; still others integrate Buddhist, Hindu, or humanist insights. This diversity doesn't signify abandoning truth but recognizing that ultimate reality transcends any single conceptual framework. The Light manifests universally, perhaps best understood through multiple perspectives held in creative tension.

We maintain epistemic humility particularly regarding dogmatic claims that historically justified violence, oppression, or exclusion. When certainty leads to harming others, we question whether such "truth" reflects the Light or merely human prejudice. The peace testimony requires epistemological as well as behavioral nonviolence—refusing to assault others' consciences with aggressive certainty.

Scripture functions as valued resource rather than ultimate authority. We read the Bible appreciatively, recognizing its spiritual wisdom and historical importance to Friends. Yet we don't limit truth to biblical bounds. Science illuminates truth about the natural world; other faiths offer wisdom about the spiritual; human rights movements reveal truth about justice. All genuine truth originates from the universal Light.

However, we're not pure relativists. Certain truths—human dignity, nonviolence, integrity, community, equality, earth's stewardship—stand firm based on corporate discernment across generations and the Light's consistent witness. We can know these truths with sufficient certainty to order our lives accordingly.

The query process keeps us examining our certainties. Rather than fixed creeds, we ask persistent questions: How do we support one another in spiritual growth? How does our corporate worship deepen? Where is the Light leading us? This method generates dynamic truth understanding.

Practically, Liberal Friends pursue truth through faithful worship attendance, patient listening to diverse voices, scientific and interfaith engagement, social justice work, and cultivating inner silence. We can know truth sufficiently for faithful living while maintaining humble openness to continuing revelation from the inexhaustible Light.

*** 1.13.40 ADVENTIST (SEVENTH-DAY) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Seventh-day Adventist theology, rooted in prophetic interpretation and present truth, answers affirmatively: we can know truth with certainty through Scripture interpreted by the Spirit of Prophecy, progressive revelation, and prophetic fulfillment. God has revealed end-time truth with sufficient clarity to prepare a people for Christ's imminent return.

Our epistemology centers on the sanctuary doctrine and investigative judgment. The 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14, understood to culminate in 1844, reveals truth about Christ's heavenly ministry that previous Christians missed. This prophetic key unlocks Scripture's integrated message. We can know truth with certainty because prophecy provides an interpretive framework confirmed by historical fulfillment and present experience.

Ellen G. White's role as prophet profoundly shapes our epistemology. Her writings function as the "lesser light" guiding people to Scripture's "greater light." While not canonical, her counsels provide inspired interpretation that clarifies biblical truth and addresses contemporary application. When White writes about health, education, prophecy, or practical godliness, Adventists receive her guidance with confidence approaching certainty. Her prophetic gift validates through fulfilled predictions, practical wisdom, and spiritual fruit.

The present truth concept acknowledges progressive revelation. God reveals truth according to time and need. Truths preserved by previous movements—Reformation justification by faith, Methodist sanctification, Baptist baptism—find culmination in Adventist understanding. We stand on others' shoulders, yet possess unique light for this generation. The Sabbath truth, lost for centuries, recovered through Adventist proclamation, exemplifies present truth's certainty.

Consider the three angels' messages of Revelation 14. These prophecies outline God's final warning to humanity: worship the Creator (thus Sabbath observance), Babylon has fallen (apostate Christianity's judgment), avoid the beast's mark (resisting false worship). Adventists know these truths with certainty because Scripture speaks clearly when properly interpreted, and our prophetic understanding has withstood decades of examination.

However, we distinguish between established truth and continuing study. The 28 Fundamental Beliefs represent corporate certainty achieved through biblical study and prophetic guidance. Yet Adventist theology remains open to deeper understanding. "Present truth" implies ongoing discovery. We hold current understanding firmly while remaining teachable regarding fuller light.

The Sabbath truth anchors our epistemic confidence. The fourth commandment stands unchanged from Sinai. Its observance tests loyalty to God versus human tradition. Historical evidence confirms the seventh-day Sabbath. When Adventists experience Sabbath blessing and observe spiritual fruit from its observance, certainty deepens through experience validating understanding.

Health message certainty illustrates prophetic guidance confirmed by science. Ellen White counseled vegetarianism, exercise, fresh air, and temperance decades before medical science validated these principles. As scientific research confirms prophetic counsel, certainty increases. We know truth not merely through revelation but through verification.

The investigative judgment doctrine, though controversial, provides certainty about salvation's objectivity. Our names come under review in heaven's court; Christ advocates for those covered by His righteousness. This understanding, while mysterious, assures believers that salvation doesn't rest on subjective feelings but objective divine decision confirmed by faithful living.

We acknowledge critics question our prophetic interpretations. Yet the consistency of Adventist theology, its biblical grounding, prophetic validation through Ellen White, practical fruit in health and education, and our global movement's growth despite opposition confirm truth's certainty.

Practically, Adventists pursue truth through systematic Bible study, Ellen White's writings, Sabbath school discussion, and applying health principles. We can know truth with certainty because God has revealed His final message through Scripture, prophecy, and inspired interpretation, preparing a people for Christ's soon return.

*** 1.13.41 RESTORATIONIST (CHURCHES OF CHRIST) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Churches of Christ, committed to restoring New Testament Christianity through biblical authority alone, answer definitively: yes, we can know truth with certainty because Scripture speaks clearly to honest, diligent students. God didn't reveal truth ambiguously; human traditions and denominational biases obscure what Scripture states plainly.

Our epistemology rests on biblical authority exclusively—no creeds, no human traditions, no extra-biblical authorities. The New Testament provides a complete pattern for the church's organization, worship, and doctrine. When we follow this pattern precisely, we restore authentic Christianity and know truth with certainty. The problem isn't Scripture's clarity but people's unwillingness to abandon traditions contradicting biblical teaching.

The five acts of worship illustrate our method: singing (without instruments), praying, preaching, communion every first day, and giving. We know these practices with certainty because the New Testament describes them explicitly while remaining silent about instrumental music, weekly collection for other purposes, or alternative worship forms. We follow the principle: speak where Scripture speaks, remain silent where Scripture remains silent. This hermeneutic generates certainty about approved practices.

Consider baptism. Scripture teaches that baptism is immersion for believers who repent, for the remission of sins (Acts 2:38). This isn't one interpretation among many but clear biblical teaching. When churches practice infant sprinkling or treat baptism as symbolic only, they depart from New Testament pattern. We can know the truth about baptism with certainty because Scripture speaks clearly and consistently.

Book, chapter, and verse preaching characterizes our teaching style. We don't rely on emotional experiences or traditional authority but on biblical citation. Truth becomes certain when grounded in specific Scripture properly interpreted. Our interpretive principles—direct command, approved example, necessary inference—provide clear methodology. When Scripture commands something, we obey. When it records apostolic practice, we follow. When logical inference from Scripture requires something, we implement it.

However, we distinguish between faith matters (salvation essentials) and opinion matters (peripheral issues). Certainty applies to faith matters—baptism's necessity, weekly communion, congregational autonomy, undenominational Christianity. Opinion matters—church building design, precise worship order, translation preference—allow individual liberty. This distinction prevents both loose relativism and rigid legalism.

The autonomous congregation model reflects epistemic confidence. We don't need hierarchical authority because Scripture provides sufficient guidance. Each congregation studies Scripture and implements truth independently. The remarkable consistency across independent Churches of Christ demonstrates truth's objective clarity—sincere students reaching identical conclusions because Scripture speaks plainly.

We acknowledge accusations of arrogance regarding our certainty. Critics claim we're just another denomination certain about our interpretations. We respond that we're not a denomination but Christians only, following the Bible only. Our certainty isn't about human wisdom but Scripture's authority. We welcome anyone to show us biblical error in our teaching; when Scripture corrects us, we change.

The restoration principle assumes truth can be recovered through biblical study. First-century Christianity stands as the certain pattern. Centuries of apostasy obscured truth, but patient biblical study restores it. The Stone-Campbell movement and subsequent restoration efforts demonstrate that sincere seekers rediscover identical truths when studying Scripture free from denominational bias.

We maintain that uncertainty about doctrine reflects inadequate study or unwillingness to abandon tradition. God didn't intend confusion. When honest students disagree, someone has misinterpreted. Continued study, prayer, and humble submission to biblical authority resolve disagreement.

Practically, Churches of Christ pursue truth through verse-by-verse Bible study, topical preaching with extensive biblical citation, adult Bible classes emphasizing knowledge, and personal daily reading. We can know truth with certainty because God revealed it clearly in Scripture, providing a complete pattern for restoration of New Testament Christianity.

*** 1.13.42 RESTORATIONIST (CHRISTIAN CHURCHES) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Christian Churches and Churches of Christ (instrumental), sharing restoration heritage while embracing evangelical fellowship, affirm confident knowledge grounded in Scripture's clarity, essential unity, and Spirit's illumination. We can know truth with certainty regarding essentials while allowing liberty concerning opinions—the motto "In essentials unity, in opinions liberty, in all things love" shapes our epistemology.

Our approach balances restorationist conviction with evangelical openness. The New Testament provides a clear pattern for foundational matters—the gospel, baptism, communion, church organization—while allowing flexibility regarding methods and peripheral practices. We can know salvific truth with certainty because Scripture speaks plainly about Jesus' identity, His atoning death, resurrection, and the response required: faith, repentance, and baptism.

The distinction between essentials and opinions prevents both skepticism and sectarianism. Essentials—Christ's deity, salvation by grace through faith, baptism's significance, weekly communion—stand certain based on clear biblical teaching. Opinions—worship style, instrumental music, organizational structures, ministry methods—allow diversity. This framework generates confidence about core truth while fostering unity despite methodological differences.

Consider baptism. We know with certainty that baptism matters—New Testament teaching couldn't be clearer. Acts 2:38 explicitly connects baptism with forgiveness. Romans 6 describes baptism as participation in Christ's death and resurrection. Yet we recognize fellow Christians who understand baptism differently as genuine believers, not imposters. Our certainty about baptism's importance doesn't require excluding those with variant interpretations.

The plea to be Christians only, not the only Christians, reflects epistemic humility alongside conviction. We're certain about Christ and Scripture's authority while acknowledging God's grace extends beyond perfect theological understanding. This differs from relativism—truth exists objectively—but recognizes human limitations in grasping every detail perfectly.

Bible college education, characteristic of our movement, demonstrates commitment to serious biblical study. We pursue truth through disciplined scholarship, original languages, historical context, and systematic theology. This intellectual rigor generates confidence that our understanding rests on solid exegesis rather than tradition or emotion. Yet education serves the church, not ivory tower speculation.

Evangelistic emphasis reveals our certainty. We boldly proclaim Christ because the gospel truth stands certain. Jesus died for sins, rose bodily, offers salvation freely. These facts don't depend on subjective experience or cultural context but on historical reality confirmed by eyewitness testimony. This objective certainty empowers confident proclamation.

However, we've grown from early restorationist exclusivism toward evangelical ecumenism. Early leaders sometimes claimed certainty too narrowly, treating opinions as essentials. Maturity brings recognizing that genuine Christians exist across denominational lines despite theological differences. This doesn't mean abandoning truth but distinguishing between core certainty and peripheral matters.

Weekly communion practice illustrates certain conviction applied graciously. We're convinced New Testament Christians observed the Lord's Supper every Sunday—Acts 20:7 establishes this pattern. Our certainty leads to faithful practice. Yet we recognize fellow believers who commune monthly or quarterly as Christians, though we believe they miss the biblical pattern.

The autonomy of local congregations reflects confidence in Scripture's sufficiency. We don't need hierarchical authority because Bible-believing churches, led by Spirit-filled elders, can govern themselves effectively. This structure assumes truth becomes accessible to ordinary believers through biblical study and prayer.

Stone and Campbell's unity vision motivates our epistemology. They believed biblical Christianity could unite divided believers if people abandoned human traditions for Scripture alone. This vision requires sufficient certainty about Scripture's clarity to pursue unity while acknowledging diversity about interpretations won't disappear completely.

Practically, Christian Churches pursue truth through expository preaching, Bible college training, congregational Bible study, small group discussion, and individual devotion. We can know truth with certainty regarding essentials because Scripture speaks clearly about salvation, while maintaining gracious humility about opinions, fostering unity across genuine believers committed to Jesus and His Word.

*** 1.13.43 RESTORATIONIST (LATTER-DAY SAINTS) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) answers emphatically: yes, we can know truth with certainty through the integrated witness of Scripture, continuing revelation through living prophets, the Holy Ghost's confirming testimony, and personal spiritual experience. God has restored truth in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith, establishing certainty impossible in apostate Christianity.

Our epistemology centers on restoration after universal apostasy. Following the death of Christ's apostles, essential truths and priesthood authority were lost. Centuries of confusion resulted from lacking prophetic guidance. In 1820, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith, initiating truth's restoration. We can know with certainty because God has spoken again through modern prophets holding authentic priesthood authority.

The Book of Mormon provides crucial evidential foundation. This ancient record, translated by the gift and power of God, confirms biblical truth while restoring plain and precious truths removed from the Bible. Its existence itself testifies to restoration's reality. When people read the Book of Mormon prayerfully and ask God sincerely whether it's true, the Holy Ghost confirms its truthfulness through burning in the bosom and enlightenment of mind. Millions of Latter-day Saints testify to receiving this witness, establishing certainty through personal revelation.

Moroni's promise (Moroni 10:3-5) operationalizes our epistemology. Read, ponder, and pray about the Book of Mormon, asking God if these things are true. God will manifest truth by the Holy Ghost. This methodology democratizes certain knowledge—anyone, regardless of education or status, can know truth directly through divine revelation. Our certainty doesn't depend on scholarly arguments but on personal encounter with God confirming truth.

The doctrine of continuing revelation through living prophets provides ongoing certainty. The President of the Church, sustained as prophet, seer, and revelator, receives divine guidance for the Church and world. When the prophet speaks, uncertainty vanishes because God directs His people through chosen servants. This doesn't mean blind obedience but confident trust that God communicates clearly through established channels.

Consider temple worship. Critics claim our temple ordinances lack biblical foundation. Yet we know with certainty these practices restore ancient truths because they've been revealed through modern prophets. The temple endowment, sealing ordinances, and baptism for the dead make sense within our restoration framework. Participants experience spiritual confirmation validating these sacred rites.

However, we acknowledge truth's progressive nature. God reveals truth line upon line, precept upon precept, as people become prepared to receive it. Joseph Smith received revelations throughout his life, each adding to previous understanding. Current prophets continue this pattern. We're certain about revealed truth while remaining open to further light and knowledge.

The priesthood organization—Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods restored through angelic ministry—provides certainty about authority. Christianity fragmented into thousands of denominations because no one possessed actual authority. With priesthood restoration, authority and truth returned definitively. We know our ordinances are valid because proper authority administers them.

The Word of Wisdom illustrates prophetic guidance confirmed by subsequent evidence. Decades before medical science validated abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea, Joseph Smith revealed this health code. As science confirms prophetic counsel, certainty increases. We know through revelation; science catches up later.

We distinguish between doctrine and personal opinion. Official doctrine, established through prophetic revelation and Church correlation, stands certain. Individual speculation about doctrinal periphery allows diversity. This distinction prevents confusion while permitting theological exploration within boundaries.

The missionary emphasis demonstrates our certainty. Tens of thousands of young people sacrifice years serving missions because they know truth with certainty through Holy Ghost confirmation. They've experienced Moroni's promise personally. This experiential certainty generates evangelistic confidence.

Practically, Latter-day Saints pursue truth through scripture study (Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price), prayer seeking Holy Ghost confirmation, following living prophets, temple worship, and missionary service. We can know truth with certainty because God has restored it through prophets, confirmed it through scripture, and validates it personally through the Holy Ghost to all who sincerely seek.

*** 1.13.44 RESTORATIONIST (JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Jehovah's Witnesses answer definitively: yes, we can know truth with certainty through God's revealed Word, the Bible, properly interpreted through the faithful and discreet slave class whom Jehovah has appointed to dispense spiritual food. In these last days, Jehovah has restored true Christianity, providing certain knowledge of His purpose and requirements.

Our epistemology centers on the Bible as sole authority, properly understood through the organization Jehovah directs. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, established by Charles Taze Russell and continuing through faithful stewardship, provides God's progressive revelation to His people. We can know truth with certainty because Jehovah teaches His organized people through publications, meetings, and organizational direction guided by His spirit.

The restoration of God's name, Jehovah, illustrates truth's recovery. For centuries, Christendom obscured God's personal name, using titles instead. Through careful biblical study, we've restored "Jehovah" to its rightful prominence, appearing over 7,000 times in the New World Translation. This recovery demonstrates that truth, though hidden by apostasy, becomes certain through diligent study under divine guidance.

The chronological understanding provides prophetic certainty. Daniel's prophecies, Jesus' signs of the last days, and Revelation's visions, properly interpreted, reveal we're living in the final days before Armageddon and God's kingdom establishment. The year 1914 marked Christ's invisible enthronement and the beginning of the last days. This prophetic understanding, refined through decades of study, provides certainty about our times and Jehovah's imminent intervention.

However, we distinguish between established truth and refined understanding. Jehovah reveals truth progressively, as "the light gets brighter" (Proverbs 4:18). Earlier understandings represented truth as then revealed; refined light brings clearer perception. This doesn't indicate error but progressive revelation as God's people advance toward fuller knowledge. We maintain certainty while remaining teachable regarding deeper understanding.

The faithful and discreet slave (Matthew 24:45-47), identified as the Governing Body, provides interpretive authority. Individual Bible study risks misinterpretation and pride. Jehovah works through His organization, providing unified understanding. When the Governing Body speaks through official publications, Witnesses receive guidance with confidence because God directs His appointed channel.

Consider the blood doctrine. Scripture clearly forbids blood consumption (Acts 15:29). We know with certainty that accepting blood transfusions violates God's law, even when medical authorities pressure otherwise. Thousands of Witnesses have maintained integrity, refusing blood despite persecution or medical risk. This conviction demonstrates certainty about biblical truth properly understood.

The rejection of Trinity doctrine illustrates restoration through biblical study. Christendom's Trinity teaching lacks biblical foundation, originating in pagan philosophy. Careful exegesis reveals the Father alone is God Almighty; Jesus is God's first creation; the holy spirit is God's active force. This understanding, though controversial, rests on clear scriptural foundation. We know it with certainty because proper interpretation confirms it.

Organizational loyalty reflects epistemic confidence. We attend meetings regularly, study publications systematically, and participate in door-to-door ministry because we're certain about truth. If we doubted, such commitment would be unreasonable. Our global unity in belief and practice—millions teaching identical truth worldwide—demonstrates objective certainty impossible in Christendom's confusion.

The witnessing work embodies our certainty. We invest countless hours proclaiming truth door-to-door because people must hear the message before Armageddon arrives. This urgency presumes certainty—we're not sharing opinions but life-saving truth. When Witnesses face persecution, imprisonment, or death rather than compromise, they demonstrate confidence impossible without genuine certainty.

We acknowledge critics charge us with false prophecies regarding 1914, 1925, 1975. We respond that these represented zealous expectations, not false prophecy. Progressive revelation refines understanding. The core truth—we're in the last days, God's kingdom will soon rule earth—stands certain even as precise timing details become clearer.

Disfellowshipping maintains truth's purity. When members embrace false teaching or practice serious sin unrepentantly, we remove them from fellowship. This protects the congregation from corruption and demonstrates that truth matters definitively. Certainty requires boundaries.

Practically, Jehovah's Witnesses pursue truth through systematic Bible study using Watch Tower publications, meeting attendance, field ministry, and submission to organizational direction. We can know truth with certainty because Jehovah has restored it through His earthly organization, revealed it through inspired Scripture, and guides His people progressively toward complete understanding before the end arrives.

*** 1.13.45 EVANGELICAL (FUNDAMENTALIST) Response

Can we know truth with certainty? Fundamentalist Evangelicalism, committed to biblical inerrancy and doctrinal precision, answers unequivocally: yes, we can know truth with certainty because God has revealed Himself infallibly in Scripture, which is verbally inspired, inerrant in the original autographs, and clear in all necessary matters. Objective truth exists, and the Bible communicates it propositionally without error.

Our epistemology rests on biblical inerrancy as foundational. If Scripture contains errors, certainty collapses into uncertainty. However, the Bible stands as God's inerrant Word, completely trustworthy in all it affirms—historical, scientific, theological. We can know truth with certainty because God, who cannot lie, has spoken clearly through inspired human authors who recorded His words precisely.

The fundamentals—biblical inerrancy, Christ's virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, and literal second coming—constitute non-negotiable truth known with absolute certainty. These doctrines don't represent one valid interpretation among many but objective reality clearly revealed in Scripture. Denying these fundamentals places one outside orthodox Christianity, not within acceptable diversity.

Propositional revelation characterizes our approach. God communicated truth in propositions—statements that are either true or false. Scripture makes factual claims about God's nature, human condition, salvation's way, and future events. These propositions admit verification. We can know truth with certainty because God revealed it in propositional form that our rational minds can comprehend accurately.

Consider creation. Genesis plainly teaches God created the universe in six literal days. This isn't poetic metaphor or ancient cosmology but historical fact. When people claim millions of years or theistic evolution, they compromise biblical authority. We know creation truth with certainty because Scripture speaks clearly, and accepting God's Word requires trusting its straightforward assertions.

Systematic theology demonstrates truth's coherent structure. Scripture presents unified truth, not contradictory perspectives. Through careful exegesis and logical synthesis, we can construct doctrinal systems with confident precision. Our theological formulations—reformed, dispensational, or other frameworks—represent faithful systematization of biblical truth.

The grammatical-historical hermeneutic ensures correct interpretation. We interpret Scripture according to grammar, literary context, and historical situation, seeking the author's intended meaning. This method generates objective conclusions rather than subjective readings. When properly applied, it yields certain knowledge of scriptural teaching.

However, we distinguish between Scripture's clarity and sinful humans' stubborn misinterpretation. The problem isn't biblical ambiguity but human rebellion. Liberal theologians deny clear biblical teaching not from interpretive difficulties but from unwillingness to submit to God's Word. Similarly, cults twist Scripture deliberately. The fault lies with interpreters, not Scripture.

Apologetics plays crucial role in establishing certainty. We defend Christianity's truth through historical evidences, fulfilled prophecy, archaeological confirmation, philosophical arguments, and experiential transformation. While faith ultimately rests on revelation, evidence confirms what Scripture reveals. The concordance between biblical assertion and factual reality strengthens certainty.

The doctrine of perspicuity—Scripture's clarity—means ordinary believers can understand essential truth through the Spirit's illumination. We don't need ecclesiastical authority interpreting for us. The Holy Spirit, using Scripture, grants saving knowledge to all who read with faith and humility. This democratic epistemology empowers individual certainty grounded in biblical study.

Separation from doctrinal compromise maintains truth's purity. We separate from liberalism, ecumenism, and any movement diluting biblical truth. This isn't mean-spiritedness but necessary conviction. If truth is certain, compromise becomes intolerable. Better to stand alone with truth than unified in error.

The battle for the Bible defines our identity. Modernism attacks biblical authority; we defend it. Neo-orthodoxy claims encounter over proposition; we affirm propositional truth. Postmodernism denies objective truth; we assert it. These are battles for certainty itself—can we know anything truly? We answer: yes, because God has spoken.

We acknowledge critics accuse us of arrogance, rigidity, and anti-intellectualism. We respond that submitting to biblical authority represents humility, not arrogance. Defending truth requires conviction. Believing God's Word doesn't indicate anti-intellectualism but proper intellectual submission to divine revelation.

Practically, fundamentalists pursue truth through systematic Bible study, memorization, expository preaching, theological education emphasizing doctrine, and separation from false teaching. We can know truth with certainty because the inerrant Bible reveals it propositionally, the Spirit illuminates faithful readers, and evidence confirms scriptural claims. Truth exists objectively, and God has revealed it clearly for those willing to believe.
