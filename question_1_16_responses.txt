*** 1.16.1 Roman Catholic (Thomist) Response

Do we have free will? From the Thomistic perspective, we possess genuine libertarian free will, understood through the framework of Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy. Thomas Aquinas synthesizes divine sovereignty with human freedom through his doctrine of primary and secondary causality.

The intellect and will constitute the rational soul's powers. The intellect presents the universal good to the will, which then freely chooses among particular goods. This freedom stems from our capacity to deliberate about means to ends. Unlike animals driven by instinct, humans possess rational appetite capable of self-determination. Free will (liberum arbitrium) is not absolute autonomy but rather the power of rational self-motion toward the good as perceived by intellect.

God's eternal knowledge and providence do not negate human freedom. As primary cause, God moves all secondary causes according to their natures. He moves necessary causes necessarily and free causes freely. Divine concurrence actualizes our free choices without coercing them, since God operates at a more fundamental ontological level than creaturely causation. God knows our free choices through His eternal present, not through temporal foreknowledge that would imply succession in divine cognition.

The difficulty lies in reconciling divine immutability with genuine human contingency. If God's eternal decree encompasses all events, how can human choices remain truly free? Thomists respond that God wills some things necessarily (His own goodness) and others contingently (creation). He wills that some effects occur through free causes, thereby establishing freedom as part of the created order's structure.

Grace perfects nature rather than destroying it. Operative grace initiates conversion, while cooperative grace works with the will's consent. Even under grace, the will maintains its natural freedom, though now elevated and healed from sin's distortions. The regenerate will freely cooperates with divine assistance, not through coercion but through the attractive power of grace illuminating the true good.

Human dignity requires free will, as moral responsibility presupposes the capacity for self-determined action. Without freedom, neither virtue nor vice, praise nor blame, would be meaningful. The natural law written on human hearts can only bind us if we possess the freedom to obey or disobey its precepts.

Therefore, Thomism affirms robust free will compatible with divine sovereignty through the sophisticated metaphysics of primary and secondary causation, where God's transcendent causality enables rather than eliminates creaturely freedom, establishing human persons as genuine agents within the cosmic order.

*** 1.16.2 Roman Catholic (Augustinian) Response

Do we have free will? The Augustinian tradition offers a nuanced affirmation: yes, but profoundly qualified by sin's effects and grace's necessity. Augustine's position emerged from his anti-Pelagian writings, where he combated the notion of autonomous moral capacity independent of divine assistance.

Before the Fall, Adam possessed liberum arbitrium—the ability not to sin (posse non peccare). This original freedom included genuine capacity for moral self-determination oriented toward God. However, this freedom was not absolute autonomy but rather the liberty to fulfill our created nature's proper end. True freedom means acting according to our rational nature's highest good, not arbitrary choice divorced from reason and virtue.

The Fall catastrophically damaged human freedom. Post-lapsarian humanity retains free will concerning earthly matters—we choose occupations, friendships, daily activities. But regarding spiritual goods and salvation, the unregenerate will suffers from invincible ignorance and disordered desire. We possess liberum arbitrium but lack libertas—genuine freedom. Sin has enslaved the will to concupiscence, making us unable not to sin (non posse non peccare). We choose freely, yet invariably choose wrongly in spiritual matters because our nature has become corrupt.

This is not absolute determinism. The will's acts remain voluntary, proceeding from internal desire rather than external compulsion. Yet they are nonetheless necessitated by our fallen nature's condition. We are free agents but not free in the sense of possessing power to choose rightly without grace. The distinction between voluntariness and freedom is crucial: post-Fall humans act voluntarily but not freely toward the good.

Divine grace does not violate freedom but restores it. Prevenient grace awakens the dormant will, operative grace initiates conversion, and cooperative grace enables the restored will to freely cooperate with divine assistance. Grace makes the will truly free by healing its bondage to sin, enabling what Augustine calls "the freedom of glory"—the ability to choose the good consistently.

God's predestination of the elect to salvation poses difficulties. If grace is irresistible and given only to the predestined, how does this preserve freedom? Augustinians respond that grace operates through the will's own inclinations, making the soul willing rather than forcing it against its desires. The elect freely choose God because grace has transformed their hearts to delight in Him.

Therefore, Augustinianism affirms free will's existence while insisting on its radical dependence on grace for any spiritually salutary action, presenting freedom not as autonomy but as liberation from sin's bondage through divine intervention.

*** 1.16.3 Roman Catholic (Scotist) Response

Do we have free will? The Scotist tradition offers an emphatic affirmation grounded in the primacy of will over intellect. John Duns Scotus presents perhaps the most robust defense of libertarian free will in medieval philosophy, centering human dignity on the will's radical self-determination.

Unlike Thomists who subordinate will to intellect, Scotus argues for the will's supremacy. The will is not merely rational appetite necessitated by the intellect's judgment about the good. Rather, it possesses intrinsic active power—the capacity for self-determination independent of intellectual necessity. The intellect presents options, but the will freely determines itself among them without being necessitated by any judgment about which option is best.

This synchronic contingency means that even when the will chooses something, it simultaneously retains the real power to choose otherwise. The will's act is not explained by prior sufficient conditions but by the will's own free causality. This is genuine libertarian freedom: nothing outside the will necessitates its choice, and no prior state of the agent (including intellectual judgments) determines the decision. The will is causa sui—self-causing—regarding its specification toward particular objects.

God's omnipotence and omniscience do not constrain human freedom. Scotus employs the distinction between God's absolute power (potentia absoluta) and ordained power(potentia ordinata). God could have created any possible world, including ones where we choose differently. His knowledge of our actual choices does not causally determine them; rather, He knows them because they are true, not vice versa. Divine knowledge is posterior in the order of explanation to free creaturely choices, though not temporal succession exists in God.

The will's freedom extends even to choosing contrary to reason's judgment. We can will evil knowing it is evil, demonstrating will's independence from intellectual determination. This affective freedom (libertas affectionis) distinguishes human persons from angels and beasts. We possess both affectio commodi (inclination to our own advantage) and affectio iustitiae (inclination to justice for its own sake), with the will freely determining which affection governs action.

Grace and freedom coexist without contradiction. God offers sufficient grace to all, but efficacious grace depends on free human cooperation. The will retains power to resist grace, preserving human dignity and moral responsibility. Grace enables but does not necessitate free cooperation.

Therefore, Scotism presents the strongest medieval case for libertarian free will, grounding human dignity in the will's radical autonomy, its capacity for self-determination unconstrained by intellectual necessity, and its status as irreducible source of contingency in the created order.

*** 1.16.4 Roman Catholic (Suarezian) Response

Do we have free will? Francisco Suárez's sophisticated synthesis affirms libertarian free will while navigating between Thomist and Molinist positions. His doctrine of "middle knowledge" (scientia media) and congruent concurrence attempts to preserve both divine sovereignty and genuine human freedom without the tensions afflicting other systems.

Suárez defines free will as the faculty's dominion over its own acts—the power to act or not act, to do this or that, without necessitation by any created cause. This freedom involves both liberty of specification (freedom regarding what to choose) and liberty of exercise (freedom regarding whether to choose at all). Unlike Thomists who emphasize intellectual causation, Suárez stresses the will's active indifference before choice, its real power to determine itself toward contrary options.

The metaphysical foundation lies in Suárez's rejection of real distinction between essence and existence, and between substance and accidents. The will is not a really distinct faculty from the soul but rather the soul itself under a certain formal aspect. This allows free acts to proceed from the person's substantial unity while maintaining their contingent character. The person, not merely the will as separate faculty, is the principle of free action.

Divine concurrence presents the central difficulty. How does God's universal causality relate to free creaturely acts? Suárez's theory of "simultaneous concurrence" holds that God and the human will simultaneously concur as partial causes producing the free act. Neither causes independently; both cooperate immediately. This differs from Thomist "prior concurrence" which seems to make God's action temporally and causally prior, potentially undermining freedom.

God's middle knowledge resolves the foreknowledge problem. Before any creative decree, God knows via scientia media what any possible free creature would freely choose in any possible circumstance. This knowledge is neither natural knowledge (of all possibilities) nor free knowledge (of actual future events) but intermediate. God then uses this knowledge to arrange circumstances where creatures will freely choose what aligns with His providential plan. Thus divine sovereignty and human freedom coexist: God infallibly achieves His purposes through His knowledge of how free creatures would actually choose.

Grace operates through congruent concurrence. God provides grace congruent with the will's actual disposition, grace that the person will in fact freely accept without being coerced. The grace is extrinsically efficacious—effective because God knew it would be freely accepted, not because it contains intrinsic irresistible power.

Therefore, Suarezian philosophy affirms robust free will through simultaneous concurrence and middle knowledge, presenting a middle way between Thomist intellectualism and Molinist occasionalism while preserving both human dignity and divine providence.

*** 1.16.5 Roman Catholic (Molinist) Response

Do we have free will? Molinism, developed by Luis de Molina, offers perhaps the most systematic defense of libertarian free will compatible with divine providence. The doctrine of middle knowledge (scientia media) forms the cornerstone of this reconciliation between divine sovereignty and human freedom.

Free will, in the Molinist account, means libertarian freedom: the power to choose among genuinely open alternatives such that nothing prior to the choice—whether external circumstances or internal states—causally determines the decision. When a person chooses, they could have chosen otherwise in precisely identical circumstances. This strong indeterminism preserves the intuition that praise and blame require ultimate responsibility originating in the agent's undetermined choice.

God possesses three logical moments of knowledge. Natural knowledge encompasses all necessary truths and possibilities—everything that could be. Free knowledge includes all actual truths about what will be, based on God's creative decrees. Between these lies middle knowledge: God's knowledge of conditional future contingents, knowing what every possible free creature would freely choose in every possible circumstance. These counterfactuals of creaturely freedom are true prior to God's creative decree yet concern free actions.

This middle knowledge is the key to reconciling divine providence with human freedom. God surveys all possible worlds accessible to Him via middle knowledge, seeing how free creatures would behave in each scenario. He then actualizes a world where creaturely free choices accomplish His providential purposes. The choices remain genuinely free—nothing determines them—yet God infallibly knows and uses them to achieve His ends. Providence operates through divine arrangement of circumstances, not through causation of free acts.

The grounding objection poses the central difficulty: what makes counterfactuals of freedom true before God's creative decree? If creaturely choices ground them, we have explanatory circularity. If God's will grounds them, freedom seems compromised. Molinists respond that these truths are primitively true, requiring no further ground beyond the subjunctive fact itself.

Grace and predestination become coherent under Molinism. God provides sufficient grace to all for salvation. Whether grace proves efficacious depends on the free human response, which God foreknows via middle knowledge. God predestines by placing individuals in circumstances where He knows they will freely accept grace, or He permits their damnation by knowing they would reject grace in any feasible circumstance.

Therefore, Molinism presents free will as libertarian self-determination, reconciled with divine omniscience through middle knowledge, allowing God to achieve His purposes through free creaturely cooperation rather than deterministic causation, thus preserving both sovereignty and freedom.

*** 1.16.6 Roman Catholic (Jansenist) Response

Do we have free will? Jansenism, associated with Cornelius Jansen and crystallized at Port-Royal, offers a qualified affirmation heavily influenced by Augustinian pessimism about post-lapsarian human capacity. The Jansenist position sparked intense controversy precisely because it seemed to minimize human freedom in favor of divine sovereignty and grace's absolute necessity.

Yes, humans possess free will in a formal sense—our acts proceed from internal volition rather than external compulsion. The will retains its natural structure as rational appetite. However, this formal freedom differs radically from the real freedom required for spiritual good. Jansenists distinguish between liberty from coercion (which we retain) and liberty from necessity (which fallen humanity lacks regarding supernatural ends). We choose freely in the sense that our choices flow from our desires, but our desires themselves are necessitated by our nature's current state.

Adam's Fall corrupted human nature entirely, not merely wounded it. Concupiscence now dominates the will, creating invincible ignorance regarding true goods and perverse inclination toward false goods. The unregenerate will necessarily chooses evil, not because external force compels it, but because internal corruption necessitates sinful choosing. We have free will but lack freedom—we freely choose our slavery to sin.

Two loves govern human action: amor sui (self-love) and amor Dei (love of God). Fallen nature operates exclusively from amor sui, rendering us incapable of genuine charity without grace. Every action of the unregenerate, however externally virtuous, proceeds from disordered self-love and thus constitutes sin or at best splendid vice (splendida vitia).

Grace alone liberates the will from sin's necessity. Efficacious grace operates irresistibly, not through coercion but by transforming the will's interior disposition so it freely delights in God. This grace is not given to all but only to the predestined elect. Sufficient grace, allegedly given to all, is a fiction—grace is either efficacious (and therefore effective) or nonexistent. The claim that God provides grace that could save if we cooperate but in fact never saves anyone seems to mock both divine power and human need.

The five condemned Jansenist propositions attempted to articulate this position, though Jansenists disputed whether they actually held them. The controversy centered on whether such teaching destroyed moral responsibility and human dignity by reducing humans to automatons of grace or concupiscence.

Therefore, Jansenism affirms free will's formal structure while insisting on humanity's utter dependence on efficacious grace for any spiritually good act, presenting a stark Augustinianism that seems to minimize human freedom's theological significance in favor of divine sovereignty.

*** 1.16.7 Roman Catholic (Modernist) Response

Do we have free will? Catholic Modernism, though condemned by Pascendi Dominici Gregis, offered a distinctive approach grounding freedom in religious experience and historical consciousness rather than scholastic metaphysics. Modernist thinkers like George Tyrrell, Alfred Loisy, and Lucien Laberthonnière reconceived freedom through the lens of modern philosophy and evolutionary thought.

Free will is not a metaphysical faculty deducible from abstract rational principles but rather an immediate datum of lived experience. We experience ourselves as free agents in moral deliberation, religious choice, and personal commitment. This experiential certainty provides stronger foundation than speculative arguments about causation and divine concurrence. Freedom belongs to the vital order of concrete existence rather than the conceptual order of intellectual systematization.

Modern science and historical consciousness require reconceiving traditional doctrines. Evolutionary biology reveals humanity as continuous with nature, not metaphysically separate. Psychological determinism from unconscious drives, social conditioning, and hereditary factors challenges libertarian free will. Rather than rejecting these insights, Modernist thought integrates them into a dynamic understanding where freedom emerges through evolution and develops historically. Freedom is not a static endowment but an achievement, growing as consciousness develops and persons transcend deterministic influences through self-awareness and spiritual growth.

Religious freedom possesses primacy over metaphysical freedom. The crucial question is not whether the will is undetermined by prior causes but whether persons can genuinely encounter the divine and respond authentically. Faith must be free or it becomes mere external conformity. The immanentist approach—finding God within human experience rather than through external authority—makes freedom central to authentic religion. Dogmatic formulations are secondary symbols expressing primary religious experience, which necessarily involves free personal response.

Traditional scholastic debates about grace and free will seem sterile when approached existentially. Grace is not supernatural intervention overriding natural causation but rather the divine presence within human experience, empowering freedom rather than constraining it. The lived experience of conversion shows grace enabling freedom, not competing with it. Efficacious and sufficient grace are conceptual distinctions failing to capture the dynamic reality of divine-human encounter.

The difficulty lies in maintaining Christian distinctives while adopting modern frameworks. If freedom is merely evolutionary development of natural consciousness, how does redemption through Christ remain necessary? Modernists respond that Christ represents the perfect realization of free divine-human union, the evolutionary goal toward which humanity moves.

Therefore, Catholic Modernism affirms free will as experiential datum and evolutionary achievement, interpreting traditional doctrines through historical consciousness and immanentist philosophy, though at potential cost of metaphysical foundations supporting those doctrines.

*** 1.16.8 Roman Catholic (Neo-Scholastic) Response

Do we have free will? Neo-Scholasticism, the nineteenth and twentieth-century revival of Thomistic and scholastic philosophy, offers a robust defense of libertarian free will using both traditional metaphysical arguments and modern philosophical resources. This tradition, exemplified by thinkers like Désiré Mercier, Jacques Maritain, and Étienne Gilson, demonstrates free will's compatibility with modern science while maintaining scholastic precision.

The psychological argument from consciousness provides an immediate starting point: we experience ourselves as free agents during deliberation and choice. This universal human experience, while not demonstrative proof, establishes a strong presumption for freedom. The moral argument reinforces this: ethical obligation, praise and blame, merit and demerit all presuppose that persons could have chosen otherwise. Without freedom, the entire moral order collapses into illusion.

Metaphysically, free will roots in the spiritual soul's immateriality and the will's formal object as universal good. Unlike sense appetite directed toward particular sensible goods, the rational will grasps goodness universally. No particular finite good exhausts the will's capacity or necessitates assent. Only the infinite Good, God Himself, could necessitate the will's adherence, and this occurs only in the beatific vision, not in earthly existence where God is known imperfectly. Among finite goods, the will maintains indifference, able to choose this or that without necessitation.

The act of free choice involves complex interaction between intellect and will. The intellect proposes various goods, the will tends toward them, the intellect deliberates about means, and finally the will freely determines itself. This process involves both receptive and active dimensions: receptive in receiving intellectual judgment, active in self-determination. Liberty is not the will acting without the intellect, but rather self-determination of the whole rational nature.

Modern determinism from physics and neuroscience poses challenges. Neo-Scholastics respond that physical determinism at the neurological level does not eliminate freedom at the psychological level. Human acts involve formal causation and final causation irreducible to efficient material causation. The spiritual soul, as substantial form of the body, transcends matter's deterministic properties while remaining embodied. Emergent properties of consciousness, though dependent on neurological substrates, exercise genuine top-down causation.

Divine providence and foreknowledge, as Aquinas explained, do not negate freedom because God's eternity transcends temporal succession. God knows free choices in His eternal now, not through prediction of future events. His primary causality operates at the level of being itself, moving free causes freely according to their natures.

Therefore, Neo-Scholasticism affirms libertarian free will through integrated psychological, moral, and metaphysical arguments, showing its compatibility with modern science while grounding it in perennial truths about human nature, rationality, and spiritual dignity.

*** 1.16.9 Roman Catholic (Transcendental Thomist) Response

Do we have free will? Transcendental Thomism, developed by Joseph Maréchal, Karl Rahner, and Bernard Lonergan, reconceives Thomistic principles through transcendental method, discovering freedom as a transcendental condition of human subjectivity and knowledge. This approach grounds freedom more deeply than traditional faculty psychology by revealing it as essential to the dynamic structure of human spirit.

The starting point is not abstract metaphysical speculation but rather transcendental analysis of the knowing subject. When we ask whether we have free will, we perform an act of questioning, deliberating, and potentially choosing. This very performance reveals freedom as the condition making such inquiry possible. To question whether we are free is to exercise freedom; denying freedom is performatively contradictory. Freedom thus emerges as a transcendental—a necessary condition for the possibility of authentic human activity.

Human consciousness exhibits dynamic orientation toward unlimited being and truth. The intellect's formal object is being as such, not merely particular beings. This unlimited horizon means no finite object exhausts human cognitive capacity. Similarly, the will's dynamism toward the good transcends any particular finite good. Freedom consists in this transcendence—the spirit's capacity to not be determined by any particular finite reality because we are already implicitly oriented toward infinite being and goodness.

Freedom is not primarily freedom of choice (libertas) among particular options but rather fundamental freedom (Freiheit)—the capacity for self-disposal before the infinite horizon. Before choosing particular objects, we possess more primordial freedom: disposing ourselves toward or away from our own transcendental end. We cannot escape this fundamental choice; even refusing to choose constitutes a choice. This existential freedom grounds particular free choices and makes them meaningful expressions of our fundamental option.

The relationship with God becomes intrinsic to freedom rather than external constraint. Because we are transcendentally oriented toward infinite being, freedom reaches its fulfillment only in opening to God. Authentic freedom is not autonomy from God but self-transcendence toward Him. Grace does not violate freedom but enables it to achieve its proper end. The supernatural existential—the universal offer of grace to all humanity—means freedom is always already graced, oriented beyond nature's exigencies toward divine life.

Knowledge and freedom interpenetrate. Free acts are not blind but involve insight; conversely, authentic knowing requires free commitment to truth. Lonergan's transcendental method—be attentive, be intelligent, be reasonable, be responsible—shows freedom as integral to the self-correcting process of authentic human development.

Therefore, Transcendental Thomism affirms free will not as one faculty among others but as the transcendental structure of human subjectivity, our dynamic orientation toward infinite being, finding fulfillment through self-transcendence toward God who is both freedom's ground and goal.

*** 1.16.10 Roman Catholic (Nouvelle Théologie) Response

Do we have free will? Nouvelle Théologie, the mid-twentieth century movement associated with Henri de Lubac, Jean Daniélou, Yves Congar, and Hans Urs von Balthasar, approaches freedom through return to patristic and biblical sources, emphasizing the supernatural's intrinsic relationship to nature and freedom's ecclesial and christological dimensions.

Freedom cannot be understood through abstract philosophical analysis divorced from humanity's concrete historical situation in salvation history. The modern concept of autonomous freedom, freedom as pure self-determination independent of God, represents a distortion. Authentic freedom, revealed in Scripture and the Fathers, is freedom for communion with God and neighbor, not freedom from relationship. Paradoxically, we become truly free by transcending egoistic autonomy through self-gift.

De Lubac's concept of the "supernatural existential" dissolves the nature-grace dichotomy plaguing post-Tridentine theology. There is no "pure nature" enjoying complete freedom independent of supernatural vocation. From the beginning, humanity has been created with a natural desire for the beatific vision—a desire that cannot be fulfilled by nature alone but points beyond itself. Freedom is constitutively oriented toward supernatural fulfillment; attempting to conceive freedom apart from this transcendent orientation misconstrues human reality.

Christ reveals freedom's true meaning. Jesus is perfectly free precisely in His perfect obedience to the Father—"not my will but yours be done." This paradox illuminates authentic freedom: self-determination reaches fulfillment not in asserting autonomy but in freely conforming to divine will. Christ's freedom demonstrates that obedience and freedom, far from contradicting each other, coincide at the deepest level when the will freely aligns with truth and goodness.

The Church provides freedom's proper context. Modern individualism conceives freedom as isolated self-determination, but patristic thought understands persons as inherently relational. We become free within communion, through participation in the Body of Christ. The saints exhibit maximum freedom precisely through maximum conformity to Christ—freedom not despite holiness but through it.

Original sin's effects require careful articulation. Following patristic rather than Augustinian emphases, Nouvelle Théologie stresses that sin damages but does not utterly destroy the image of God. Humanity retains natural capacity for truth and goodness, though requiring grace for perfection. Freedom is wounded but not eliminated, requiring healing and elevation rather than total replacement.

Grace perfects nature by enabling freedom to achieve its intrinsic supernatural vocation. Grace is not external imposition but the fulfillment of humanity's deepest natural desire. The cooperation between grace and free will reflects the greater mystery of God's action enabling creaturely action without competition.

Therefore, Nouvelle Théologie affirms free will within the context of humanity's supernatural vocation, understanding freedom as self-transcendence toward communion with God revealed in Christ and realized in the Church's sacramental life.

*** 1.16.11 Eastern Orthodox (Patristic) Response

Do we have free will? The Patristic tradition, foundational to Eastern Orthodoxy, offers an emphatic affirmation rooted in early Church Fathers like Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus the Confessor, and John of Damascus. Free will constitutes an essential aspect of the image of God (imago Dei) and grounds human capacity for theosis (deification).

God created humanity in His image and likeness. The distinction between "image" and "likeness" proves significant: the image includes rationality and free will as given endowments, while likeness represents the perfection achieved through synergy (cooperation) between divine grace and human freedom. Free will belongs to human nature's essential structure. Without it, humans would be mechanisms or animals, incapable of genuine virtue or relationship with God. Love cannot be coerced; authentic communion requires freedom.

The Fall did not destroy free will but misdirected it. Unlike Western traditions emphasizing total depravity, Patristic thought maintains that the image of God, including freedom, remains intact though damaged. Sin is not inherited guilt but inherited mortality and corruptibility. This ancestral sin weakens but does not eliminate our capacity for good. We retain natural capacity to seek God, though we require grace for salvation. The will became enslaved to passions (pathē) but retained its essential structure.

Maximus the Confessor's distinction between natural will (thelēma physikon) and gnomic will (thelēma gnomikon) illuminates freedom's nature. Natural will is the faculty's orientation toward the good according to nature. Gnomic will is deliberative choice among alternatives, necessary for fallen humanity uncertain about the good. Christ possessed natural will but not gnomic will—He freely willed the good without deliberative uncertainty. Redemption transforms our gnomic willing into natural willing aligned with divine intent.

Grace and free will cooperate synergistically. The Semi-Pelagian controversy's Western framing is largely foreign to Eastern thought. Grace does not compete with freedom but empowers it. God initiates, sustains, and completes salvation, yet human cooperation remains necessary—not as merit earning grace but as response enabling grace's effectiveness. This synergy preserves both divine sovereignty and human dignity without the determinism plaguing some Western traditions.

The ascetic tradition demonstrates freedom's therapeutic restoration. Through prayer, fasting, and spiritual disciplines, we progressively free the will from passion's tyranny, recovering its natural orientation toward God. This represents not external compulsion but healing of our nature, enabling the will to function according to its created purpose.

Therefore, Patristic Orthodoxy affirms robust free will as essential to human nature's created structure, damaged by sin but restorable through grace, cooperating synergistically with divine action toward the ultimate goal of theosis and communion with God.

*** 1.16.12 Eastern Orthodox (Palamite) Response

Do we have free will? The Palamite tradition, based on Gregory Palamas's fourteenth-century synthesis, affirms free will within the framework of the essence-energies distinction, hesychast spirituality, and the theology of divine-human communion. This tradition offers unique insights into freedom's nature through contemplative experience and apophatic theology.

Free will belongs to human nature as image of God. However, understanding freedom requires distinguishing between God's essence (ousia) and energies (energeiai). God's essence remains absolutely transcendent, unknowable, and inaccessible. His energies are His real self-manifestation, how He genuinely acts in creation while remaining transcendent in essence. This distinction preserves both divine transcendence and genuine divine-human communion.

Human freedom participates in divine freedom through grace, understood as uncreated divine energy. When we speak of grace enabling free will, we do not mean created supernatural habits (as in Western scholasticism) but rather participation in God's own uncreated energies. Grace is not something God creates distinct from Himself but God's own presence and activity. Therefore, grace empowering freedom is not external causation but our genuine participation in divine life and freedom.

The hesychast practice reveals freedom's deepest dimensions. Through the Jesus Prayer, stillness (hesychia), and guarding of the intellect (nous), practitioners experience progressive liberation from passion's tyranny. This is not psychological technique but spiritual warfare against logismoi (invasive thoughts). The will becomes free by being united to God through unceasing prayer. Freedom increases as we participate more fully in divine energies through contemplative practice.

The nous (spiritual intellect) and heart's purification directly relates to freedom. Sin darkens the nous, distorting perception of reality and enslaving the will to delusion. Grace illuminates the nous, enabling us to see reality truly, including our own nature and God's presence. This illumination liberates the will because we now desire what is genuinely good rather than phantasms produced by darkened consciousness.

The experience of divine light (theoria) demonstrates freedom's fulfillment. Hesychasts report experiencing the uncreated light of Tabor—the same glory revealed in Christ's Transfiguration. This is not metaphorical but real experience of divine energies. In this state, the will is maximally free precisely because maximally united with God. Freedom is not autonomy but union; the will becomes "deified" while remaining human.

Humanity's natural capacity for God (the capax Dei) grounds the possibility of this participatory freedom. We are created with inherent orientation toward theosis, which grace fulfills rather than contradicts. Freedom is progressively realized as we ascend through purification (katharsis), illumination (photismos), and theosis.

Therefore, Palamite theology affirms free will as participating in divine freedom through uncreated energies, realized through hesychast practice, culminating in theosis where human freedom finds fulfillment in union with God while maintaining personal distinctness.

*** 1.16.13 Eastern Orthodox (Neo-Patristic) Response

Do we have free will? Neo-Patristic synthesis, developed by twentieth-century Orthodox theologians like Georges Florovsky, Vladimir Lossky, and John Meyendorff, retrieves Patristic wisdom while engaging modernity, offering a personalist account of freedom grounding human dignity and critiquing Western rationalism.

Freedom defines personhood itself. The person is not merely an individual instance of universal human nature but rather a unique, irreducible hypostasis (concrete particular). Personhood transcends nature; the person possesses nature but is not exhausted by it. This distinction, rooted in Cappadocian theology's Trinitarian formulations, has profound implications for freedom. While nature determines what we are, the person determines who we are through free self-determination. Freedom is not a property persons possess but constitutive of personal existence itself.

Western philosophy's mistake was subordinating freedom to nature, either through essentialist rationalism or biological determinism. The person's hypostatic character means freedom transcends natural determination. We are not merely instances of human nature following nature's laws but persons who possess and transcend nature through freedom. This personalism grounds absolute human dignity: each person is a unique world, an unrepeatable image of God, possessing intrinsic worth independent of function or capacity.

The Trinitarian prototype illuminates freedom's nature. The divine Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—are perfectly free while sharing one essence. Their freedom consists not in choosing among alternatives (gnomic will) but in perfect self-giving love. The Father freely generates the Son, the Son freely receives and reciprocates, the Spirit proceeds freely. This perichoretic freedom, the interpenetration of divine Persons in mutual love, provides the model for human freedom. We are created for analogous communion, where freedom finds fulfillment in self-transcending love.

The Fall distorted freedom without destroying it. Sin introduced death, corruption, and the fragmentation of communion. The person became enslaved to biological necessity, fear, and egoistic self-assertion. However, the hypostatic foundation of freedom—personhood itself—remained intact. Christ's Incarnation, as hypostatic union of divine and human natures in one Person, restored the possibility of authentic personhood and freedom. In Christ, human nature is healed and elevated while personal freedom is preserved.

Sobornost (conciliarity) provides freedom's proper social context. Western individualism isolates persons as autonomous monads. Orthodox ecclesiology understands the Church as communion of persons in love, preserving both unity and diversity. Freedom is realized not in isolation but in community, through relations of mutual love reflecting Trinitarian perichoresis.

Therefore, Neo-Patristic thought affirms free will as constitutive of personhood, grounded in Trinitarian theology, transcending natural determination, finding fulfillment in loving communion, and providing foundation for absolute human dignity against all reductionism.

*** 1.16.14 Eastern Orthodox (Russian Religious Philosophy) Response

Do we have free will? Russian Religious Philosophy, represented by thinkers like Nikolai Berdyaev, Vladimir Solovyov, Sergei Bulgakov, and Pavel Florensky, offers a distinctive personalist and existentialist approach emphasizing freedom's metaphysical primacy, creativity, and tragic dimensions. This tradition engages German idealism and existentialism while remaining rooted in Orthodox spirituality.

Berdyaev argues for freedom's primacy over being itself. Freedom is not created by God because freedom prior to being cannot be created—it is the groundless Ungrund (borrowing from Jacob Boehme) from which both God's creative activity and human response emerge. This shocking claim attempts to preserve absolute human freedom and theodicy: God is not responsible for evil because freedom precedes God's creative decree. We participate in uncreated freedom, making us genuinely creative rather than merely choosing among predetermined options.

This freedom is both exhilarating and terrifying. We are condemned to freedom, bearing responsibility for creating ourselves and contributing to creation's ongoing realization. Freedom enables both the highest spiritual creativity—art, love, moral heroism—and the deepest degradation. The tragic dimension of existence stems from freedom's misuse, generating evil that God Himself cannot prevent without contradicting freedom's primacy.

Solovyov's sophiology connects freedom with divine wisdom (Sophia). Humanity occupies a mediating position between divine and material realms, called to unite them through free creative activity. This worldly theosis involves transforming matter through spirit, realizing God-manhood (Bogochelovechestvo) throughout creation. Freedom is the capacity to participate in this cosmic process, cooperating with divine Sophia in creation's transfiguration. History is the drama of freedom—whether humanity will freely realize unity with God and cosmic harmony or fall into fragmentation.

Bulgakov emphasizes freedom's kenotic character. True freedom is self-emptying love, imitating Christ's kenosis. The paradox is that we become free by freely limiting our autonomy through love. Divine-humanity (Bogochelovechestvo) represents the synthesis of divine initiative and human freedom in mutual self-giving. Creativity flows from this kenotic freedom—genuinely new possibilities emerge through loving cooperation with divine creativity.

The Russian tradition's existentialism addresses modern alienation. Industrial society, rationalism, and collectivism threaten personhood by reducing humans to functions, objects, or mass. Authentic freedom requires resistance to this objectification, asserting the person's irreducible subjectivity and creative potential. Social transformation must preserve freedom against totalitarian temptations claiming to create paradise through coercion.

Therefore, Russian Religious Philosophy affirms free will with unusual radicality, seeing freedom as metaphysically primordial, creative, tragic, kenotic, and essential to human participation in cosmic theosis, while warning against social systems threatening personhood.

*** 1.16.15 Lutheran (Confessional) Response

Do we have free will? Confessional Lutheranism, grounded in Luther's writings and the Book of Concord, offers a carefully nuanced position: yes regarding earthly matters, absolutely no regarding spiritual salvation. This distinction, articulated in the Formula of Concord, responds to both Catholic synergism and Protestant hyper-Augustinianism.

Luther's Bondage of the Will argues against Erasmian humanism's optimistic assessment of human capacity. Regarding "things below" (res inferiores)—temporal, earthly matters like occupation, marriage, civic duty—humanity retains limited freedom. We choose what to eat, where to live, how to conduct business. Free will functions in the civil realm, making humans responsible citizens and neighbors. However, this freedom is relative, limited by circumstances, and tainted by sin's corruption affecting even civil righteousness.

Regarding "things above" (res superiores)—spiritual matters, faith, salvation—the unregenerate will possesses no freedom whatsoever. We are either under God's reign or Satan's; there is no neutral territory. The Fall so corrupted human nature that we are utterly unable to initiate or contribute to salvation. We are "curved in upon ourselves" (incurvatus in se), enslaved to self-love, incapable of authentic love for God. Every attempt at spiritual merit produces self-righteousness, which is the opposite of saving faith.

This bondage is not external compulsion but internal necessity. The unregenerate will freely chooses according to its nature, yet its nature is corrupt. We sin voluntarily, with whole-hearted consent, yet necessarily because our nature is enslaved to sin. This is compatibilist freedom: our acts are voluntary (proceeding from internal desire) but determined by our nature's state. True freedom would mean ability to choose God, which the fallen will lacks entirely.

Justification by faith alone excludes any contribution from free will. If salvation required free cooperation, it would partly depend on human merit, contradicting sola gratia. The Formula of Concord explicitly condemns synergism—the teaching that conversion requires cooperation between divine grace and human will. God alone converts; the Holy Spirit creates faith without preconditions. Before regeneration, we are "dead in trespasses," and the dead do not cooperate with their resurrection.

After regeneration, freedom is restored but remains imperfect. The regenerate person is simul justus et peccator—simultaneously justified and sinner. The new nature can cooperate with the Holy Spirit in sanctification, yet the old nature remains, struggling against the Spirit. This "bound freedom" means the Christian freely serves God yet imperfectly, requiring continual forgiveness. Full freedom awaits glorification.

Therefore, Confessional Lutheranism affirms limited civil freedom while denying spiritual freedom to the unregenerate, insisting on salvation by grace alone through the Spirit's monergistic work, restoring imperfect freedom to believers who remain simultaneously justified and sinful.
