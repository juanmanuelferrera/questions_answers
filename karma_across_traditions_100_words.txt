Karma Across Philosophical Traditions (100 words)

Karma operates through radically different mechanisms across philosophical traditions, reflecting diverse metaphysical assumptions about causation, agency, and liberation.

Buddhist traditions emphasize intentional action (cetana) as the driving force. Theravada focuses on individual liberation through understanding cause-effect, Mahayana extends motivation toward freeing all beings, while Vajrayana works directly with afflictive emotions themselves.

Hindu Vedanta schools agree karma requires divine administration. Advaita views karma as part of Maya's illusory reality dispensed by Ishvara. Vishishtadvaita's Ramanuja attributes suffering to accumulated karma while maintaining God's purity. Dvaita emphasizes karma yoga alongside knowledge and devotion.

Jainism presents a unique materialist conception: karma consists of subtle physical particles (pudgala) pervading the universe that literally adhere to souls through actions, requiring rigorous asceticism for removal.
