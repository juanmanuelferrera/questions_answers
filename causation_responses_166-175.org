*** 1.4.166 Theravada Buddhism (Abhidhamma perspective) Response

Theravada Buddhism's Abhidhamma perspective conceptualizes causation through paticca-samuppada (dependent origination) operating via distinct conditioning relations (paccaya) between dharmas (momentary phenomena). Causation emerges not from substantial entities but from the lawful arising of conditions producing effects within an impermanent, non-self universe.

The Abhidhamma Pitaka, systematized between the 3rd century BCE and 1st century CE, particularly the Patthana (Book of Relations), articulates twenty-four types of conditional relations. Buddhaghosa (5th century CE) in the Visuddhimagga elaborated these into a comprehensive causal taxonomy. Mahasi Sayadaw (1904-1982) applied Abhidhamma causation to vipassana meditation, emphasizing direct experiential understanding of momentary arising and passing.

The Patthana distinguishes hetu-paccaya (root condition), arammana-paccaya (object condition), adhipati-paccaya (decisive support), and anantara-paccaya (contiguity condition), among others. These relations operate across mental and material dharmas at sub-second intervals. The Abhidhammattha Sangaha (11th-12th century) synthesizes these into practical frameworks for understanding the mechanics of karma and rebirth.

Core arguments include: (1) Momentariness (khanikata-vada): dharmas exist for only one thought-moment (cittakkhana), making causation a process of instantaneous arising dependent on previous conditions rather than enduring substance transformation. (2) Multiple conditioning: any dharma arises from the simultaneous operation of multiple paccaya, rejecting single-cause determinism. (3) Lawfulness without agent: causation operates through dhamma-niyama (natural law) without requiring a creator deity or substantial self—effects follow conditions with invariable regularity.

The Milindapañha illustrates causal continuity without identity through the flame analogy: successive moments are neither identical nor different, just as a lamp's flame at midnight neither is nor is not the flame at dawn. The Visuddhimagga VII.19 states: "No doer is found apart from the deed, no experiencer apart from the experience—just dharmas roll on."

Internal variations include debates about whether cetana (volition) constitutes true agency or merely another conditioned phenomenon. The Sautrantika-influenced perspective emphasizes seed-like causal potentials, while orthodox Theravada maintains strict momentariness.

Counter-arguments addressing substantialist causation emphasize that common-sense notions of enduring causes are conventional designations (sammuti) masking the ultimate reality (paramattha) of momentary conditional arising. Contemporary neuroscience applications interpret neural correlates as material dharmas in conditional relation to mental dharmas, with mindfulness practices revealing the actual texture of causation beneath conceptual overlays. Compared to Madhyamaka Buddhism, Abhidhamma maintains more robust dharma reality while sharing the rejection of substantial causation.

*** 1.4.167 Tibetan Bon Response

Tibetan Bon tradition conceives causation as the dynamic interplay between primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub), manifested through the five elements and mediated by interdependent origination (rten 'brel), with significant influence from both indigenous shamanic worldviews and later Buddhist philosophical integration.

Bon's systematization occurred in multiple waves: the pre-Buddhist period emphasizing ritual causation through sacrifice and divination; the systematization under Tonpa Shenrab (traditional dating disputed, possibly 1st millennium BCE mytho-historical figure); and the reformed Yungdrung Bon emerging from the 11th century onward, particularly through Shenchen Luga (996-1035) who integrated Buddhist philosophical frameworks. Contemporary teachers like Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche (b. 1961) emphasize Bon's distinctive approach to causation within Dzogchen practice.

The Zhang Zhung Nyan Gyud and Twelve Cosmological Treatises describe causation emerging from the primordial state (ye gzhi) through the five proto-elements ('byung ba lnga)—sa (earth), chu (water), me (fire), rlung (wind), and nam mkha (space). These elements interact through supporting and controlling cycles similar to Chinese wu xing but with distinctively Bon cosmological dimensions.

Core arguments include: (1) Tri-temporal causation: past karmic seeds (las kyi sa bon), present conditions (rkyen), and future fruitions (bras bu) operate across lifetimes, with particular emphasis on the role of la (soul-essence) as causal continuum—a concept more robust than Buddhist anatman. (2) Ritual efficacy: Bon maintains stronger belief in external ritual causation through offerings, divination, and deity propitiation than Buddhism, viewing cosmic elements as responsive to human ritual action. (3) Five-element dynamics: causation operates through elemental transformations following natural law (bon nyid kyi nges pa) discoverable through observation and spiritual realization.

The Bonpo Great Perfection texts describe causation ultimately as spontaneous self-perfection (lhun grub) of the basis (gzhi), where apparent cause-effect sequences emerge from timeless gnosis yet function conventionally. The Mother Tantra states: "From the unborn base, all causes spontaneously manifest; from the unchanging essence, all effects naturally arise."

Internal variations distinguish reformed Yungdrung Bon, closely paralleling Buddhist philosophy, from New Bon retaining shamanic elements emphasizing spirit agency in causation, and household Bon practitioners maintaining folk causal beliefs in local deities and elemental spirits.

Counter-arguments to pure mechanistic causation emphasize experiential realization of rigpa (awareness) as transcending yet enabling causal sequences. Contemporary applications include environmental causality through elemental balance and psycho-physical healing addressing causal roots in elemental constitution. Compared to Tibetan Buddhism, Bon maintains distinctive cosmological causation through elemental cycles and stronger acceptance of la-essence as causal vehicle across rebirths.

*** 1.4.168 Chinese Folk Religion Response

Chinese Folk Religion conceives causation as the harmonious interaction of tian (heaven), di (earth), and ren (humanity) governed by fundamental principles including ganying (resonance-response), bao (reciprocity-retribution), and the dynamic interplay of yin-yang and wuxing (five phases), embedded within ancestral continuity and cosmic-moral correspondence.

This causal framework developed over millennia, synthesizing shamanic divination traditions from the Shang dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE), the yinyang and wuxing theories systematized during the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) particularly through Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BCE), and popular religious practices crystallizing during the Tang-Song period (618-1279 CE). Contemporary practice maintains these frameworks through temple rituals, almanac consultation (tongsheng), and fengshui applications.

The Yijing (Book of Changes) provides the foundational text for understanding causation through hexagram transformations representing cosmic patterns. The Taiping Jing and Baopu zi articulate daoist-influenced causation through qi transformation. Popular morality books like the Ganying pian (Treatise on Response and Retribution, 12th century) detail moral causation through ledgers of merit and demerit.

Core arguments include: (1) Ganying (resonance-response): similar essences mutually attract and influence each other across spatial and temporal distances—human actions resonate with cosmic forces producing concordant responses. Heaven responds to moral human behavior with fortune or disaster. (2) Bao (reciprocity): all actions generate corresponding returns following the principle "good will be rewarded with good, evil with evil" (shan you shan bao, e you e bao), operating both within lifetimes and through ancestral lines. (3) Wuxing mutual production and conquest: causation follows five-phase cycles (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) in productive sequences (xiang sheng) and controlling sequences (xiang ke), applicable to seasonal changes, organ systems, and social dynamics.

The Ganying pian states: "There are no special doors to calamity and fortune; humans themselves invite them through their actions." The Huangdi Neijing applies five-phase causation to medical etiology, tracing disease causes through elemental imbalances and seasonal improprieties.

Internal variations include elite interpretations emphasizing naturalistic wuxing causation versus popular beliefs in immediate deity intervention and spirit causation, and tensions between karmic causation (Buddhist influence) and ancestral causation (indigenous framework).

Counter-arguments to Buddhist karmic individualism emphasize familial and social causation—ancestors' deeds affect descendants, creating collective causal networks transcending individual karma. Contemporary applications include traditional Chinese medicine's five-phase diagnosis, fengshui environmental causation, and almanac-based timing for life events. Compared to philosophical Daoism, folk religion maintains more anthropomorphic causal agents (deities, ancestors) alongside naturalistic principles, creating a richly layered causal cosmology.

*** 1.4.169 Vietnamese Folk Religion Response

Vietnamese Folk Religion conceptualizes causation through the integration of tam giao (three teachings: Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism) within indigenous spirit cosmology, emphasizing ancestral causation, cosmic harmony (hoa hop), karmic reciprocity (nhan qua bao ung), and the causal efficacy of ritual mediation between visible and invisible realms.

The framework developed through Chinese cultural influence beginning in the 1st century BCE, particularly Han dynasty cosmological ideas, synthesized with indigenous Dong Son culture beliefs in nature spirits and ancestor veneration. The Ly-Tran dynasties (1009-1400) saw Buddhism deeply influence causal thinking, while the Le-Nguyen period (1428-1945) emphasized Confucian moral causation. Prominent systematizers include the 14th-century Buddhist master Tue Trung Thuong Si and syncretist traditions like Cao Dai (founded 1926) which explicitly unified causal theories across traditions.

Core texts include the Linh Nam chich quai (14th century) presenting founding myths with causal explanations for Vietnamese culture, Buddhist sutras in Vietnamese translation emphasizing karma, and morality books like Vietnamese versions of the Ganying pian. The Cao Dai canon and Hoa Hao Buddhist texts provide 20th-century systematizations.

Core arguments include: (1) Ancestral causal continuity: descendants experience fortune or misfortune based on ancestors' accumulated virtue or transgression, requiring filial offerings and tomb maintenance to maintain positive causal flow—ancestors function as causal mediators between cosmic forces and family fortunes. (2) Triadic causation: thien (heaven), dia (earth), and nguoi (humanity) form an interactive causal triad where human moral conduct affects natural phenomena and agricultural prosperity through cosmic responsiveness. (3) Spirit-mediated causation: Than (beneficial spirits), Ma (harmful spirits), and deities like the Four Immortals causally intervene in human affairs when properly propitiated or when cosmic balance is disturbed.

The Vietnamese proverb "Co nhan co qua, co cong co viec" (there are causes, there are effects; there are contributions, there are results) captures the practical causation ethics. The Cao Dai teaching emphasizes "Nhan qua bao ung" applying Buddhist karma within Vietnamese communal frameworks.

Internal variations include northern emphases on Confucian moral causation versus southern stronger Buddhist karmic interpretations, urban elite naturalistic interpretations versus rural robust spirit-causation beliefs, and reformed movements like Hoa Hao emphasizing internal moral causation over ritual mediation.

Counter-arguments to individualistic karma emphasize Vietnamese communal causation where family and village merit and demerit accumulate collectively. Contemporary applications include ancestor worship maintaining causal connection with deceased relatives, consultation of spiritual mediums for causal diagnosis of misfortunes, and fengshui (phong thuy) for directing environmental causation.

Compared to Chinese folk religion, Vietnamese tradition places greater emphasis on Buddhist karma while maintaining distinctive indigenous spirits. Compared to Theravada Buddhism influential in Southeast Asia, Vietnamese Buddhism is more heavily layered with Mahayana and indigenous communal causal concepts, creating a uniquely syncretic causal framework serving village cohesion and family continuity.

*** 1.4.170 Korean Shamanism (Muism) Response

Korean Shamanism (Muism) conceptualizes causation through the interaction of sin (gods/spirits), jo-sang (ancestors), and human beings within a cosmos structured by principles of harmony (hwa), cyclical transformation following eum-yang (yin-yang), and the causal efficacy of han (accumulated grievance-energy) requiring ritual resolution through gut (shamanic ceremonies).

Muism's causal framework emerged from prehistoric Korean cosmology, with archaeological evidence from the Bronze Age (c. 1500-300 BCE) showing shamanic practices. The Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE-668 CE) saw systematization alongside Buddhism and Confucianism, creating distinctive Korean syncretism. The Joseon dynasty (1392-1897) officially suppressed shamanism while it persisted in popular practice. Contemporary revival and scholarly documentation began with Choe Nam-seon (1890-1957) and continued through practitioners like Kim Keum-hwa (1931-2019), designated Living National Treasure.

While Muism lacks centralized texts, the Samguk yusa (13th century) preserves founding myths revealing causal cosmology, particularly the Dangun myth showing heaven-earth causation. Anthropological documentation like Lee Jung-young's "Korean Shamanistic Rituals" (1981) and Kendall's "Shamans, Housewives, and Other Restless Spirits" (1985) provide scholarly frameworks for understanding Muist causation.

Core arguments include: (1) Han-based causation: accumulated grievance, injustice, or unfulfilled desire creates causal energy (han) that produces misfortune, illness, and social discord until ritually resolved—spirits of those who died unjustly or prematurely become causal agents affecting the living. (2) Spirit causation: multiple categories of spirits (household gods like Seonang and Jowang, nature spirits, ancestor spirits, and Buddhist/Daoist deities) directly cause fortune and misfortune based on proper ritual attention and offerings, creating a causally responsive cosmos requiring ongoing ritual maintenance. (3) Cyclical harmony disruption: causation operates through restoration of disturbed cosmic balance—illness and misfortune indicate disharmony requiring diagnostic ritual (jeomsin) to identify spiritual causes and therapeutic ritual (gut) to restore balance.

The principle "sin-i myeong-ha-da" (the spirits make clear) indicates diagnostic divination revealing hidden causes. The mudang (shaman) states during possession: "I do not speak; the spirit speaks through me," identifying specific causal agents and prescribing resolution rituals.

Internal variations include regional differences with northern emphasis on warrior gods and southern on household deities, class distinctions between mudang (professional shamans) and tangol (hereditary shamans), and tensions between folk practice and New Religions like Cheondoism incorporating shamanic causation into systematized theology.

Counter-arguments to purely naturalistic causation emphasize experiential validation through divination accuracy and healing efficacy, where spirit-identified causes correspond to observable outcomes when properly addressed. Contemporary applications include psychological reframing of han as trauma requiring ritual processing, shamanic healing addressing psychosomatic causation, and gut ceremonies for corporate success and national reconciliation.

Compared to Chinese folk religion, Muism places greater emphasis on han-causation and dramatic ritual resolution. Compared to Japanese Shinto, Korean shamanism maintains stronger individual shamanic possession and more explicit spirit negotiation for causal intervention, reflecting Korea's distinctive historical experiences of invasion and social disruption encoded in han.

*** 1.4.171 Tengrism Response

Tengrism conceives causation as emanating from Tengri (Eternal Blue Sky) through cosmic order (törü/törö), manifesting via the dynamic balance of upper (celestial), middle (earthly), and lower (subterranean) worlds, mediated by spiritual forces and expressed through cyclical natural processes, ancestral power, and the causal efficacy of ritual harmony with cosmic law.

Tengrism developed among Central Asian nomadic peoples from at least the Bronze Age (3rd-2nd millennium BCE), with clearest documentation from the Xiongnu confederation (3rd century BCE onward). The Orkhon inscriptions (8th century CE) of the Göktürk Empire provide the earliest written evidence of Tengrist cosmology. The Mongol Empire period (13th-14th centuries) saw sophisticated systematization, though much was lost to Islamization and Christianization. Contemporary revival movements in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan since the 1990s have reconstructed Tengrist philosophy through archaeological evidence, ethnographic records, and continuous shamanic lineages, with scholars like Damdinsuren Tömörtogoo contributing to systematization.

The Orkhon inscriptions state: "When the blue Tengri above and the brown Earth beneath were created, between them human beings were created." The Altan Tobchi (Mongolian chronicle) and shamanic oral traditions preserved by Buryat and Altaic peoples provide cosmological frameworks. The Secret History of the Mongols reveals causation through Tengri's mandate and ancestral blessings.

Core arguments include: (1) Hierarchical emanation: Tengri (supreme sky deity) serves as ultimate cause, delegating causal power through Eje (Mother Earth), subsidiary spirits (ongons), and ancestors, creating a cascade of causation from transcendent source to particular effects. (2) Törü (cosmic law): causation operates through natural order discoverable through observation of celestial and seasonal cycles—violation of törü produces inevitable negative consequences through cosmic self-correction. (3) Soul-force causation: the süld (soul-essence) of great individuals, especially ancestors and heroes, continues as causal agent after death, affecting descendants' fortune and tribal prosperity.

The concept of sülde represents concentrated spiritual power as causal force—Genghis Khan's sülde continued protecting the Mongol state. Shamanic practice identifies ongons (ancestor spirits in material objects) as causal agents requiring propitiation. The principle "Tengri beridü" (Tengri gives) indicates divine causation behind fortune, while misfortune results from törü violation or inadequate ancestral veneration.

Internal variations include differences between Mongolian emphasis on Tengri monotheism versus Siberian polytheistic spirit causation, debates about whether Tengri actively intervenes or operates through impersonal law, and urban educated revival movements emphasizing philosophical naturalism versus rural shamanic practice maintaining robust spirit causation.

Counter-arguments to mechanistic naturalism emphasize the experiential reality of spirit causation validated through shamanic journey, divination accuracy, and ritual efficacy. Contemporary applications include environmental ethics based on Earth-mother causation requiring ecological respect, national identity movements emphasizing cultural causation through ancestral connection, and attempts to integrate Tengrist causation with quantum physics concepts of non-local causation.

Compared to Abrahamic monotheism, Tengrism maintains more impersonal ultimate causation through Tengri while allowing greater subsidiary spirit agency. Compared to Siberian shamanism generally, Tengrist traditions emphasize more systematic cosmic law (törü) alongside spirit causation, reflecting the organizational sophistication of nomadic empire builders.

*** 1.4.172 Slavic Native Faith Response

Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery) conceptualizes causation through the cosmic ordering principle of Prav (right order), Rod (generative deity/ancestral continuum), and cyclical cosmic processes embodied in Svarog's wheel, operating through divine emanations, natural law (Kон/Kon), and the dynamic interaction of Nav (chaos/potential) and Yav (manifest reality).

The reconstruction of pre-Christian Slavic causation faces significant challenges due to Christian suppression from the 10th-14th centuries and limited written sources. Primary sources include the disputed Book of Veles (authenticity debated but influential in revival), archaeological evidence, Byzantine chronicles like those of Procopius (6th century), and Slavic folklore preserving cosmological elements. Modern revival began in the early 20th century, accelerated post-Soviet in the 1990s through figures like Aleksandr Belov (Selidor) and Veleslav (Ilya Cherkasov), who systematized contemporary Rodnovery theology drawing from comparative Indo-European studies and Slavic ethnography.

The reconstructed cosmology describes Rod as primordial generative principle from which all emanates, similar to Vedic concepts. The Triglav (three-headed principle) represents different aspects of divine causation: Svarog (celestial order), Perun (active force), and Veles (transformative wisdom). The cosmic pillar connecting worlds represents causal flow between divine, human, and chthonic realms.

Core arguments include: (1) Prav-based causation: cosmic right order (Prav) functions as natural law governing cause-effect relations—actions aligned with Prav produce harmony and prosperity, while violations generate discord and suffering through inherent cosmic correction. This parallels concepts of rta (Vedic) and asha (Zoroastrian). (2) Rod as generative causation: causation operates through Rod (simultaneously supreme deity and ancestral continuum), where ancestral deeds and merits causally affect descendants through blood lineage, requiring veneration and ritual maintenance. (3) Triadic cosmology: causation flows between Nav (unmanifest potential, chaos, underworld), Yav (manifest world), and Prav (divine order), with human actions influencing which potentials from Nav manifest into Yav based on alignment with Prav.

The concept of доля (dolya, fate/portion) represents individual causal allotment shaped by ancestral karma, birth circumstances, and personal choices within cosmic order. The principle "как аукнется, так и откликнется" (as you call out, so it echoes back) expresses reciprocal causation.

Internal variations include monotheistic interpretations (Rod as supreme cause) versus polytheistic (multiple divine causes), debates between naturalistic Prav-as-physical-law versus theistic interpretations, tensions between Slavophile ethnic exclusivism and universal interpretations of Slavic principles, and differences between Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish reconstructions emphasizing different deities and causation mechanisms.

Counter-arguments to Christian linear causation and final judgment emphasize cyclical cosmic causation through Svarog's wheel and reincarnation within bloodlines. Contemporary applications include ecological causation based on nature's sacred interconnection, Slavic martial arts emphasizing energetic causation through vril-like concepts, and folk healing maintaining traditional causal diagnosis through intuition and ancestral connection.

Compared to Vedic traditions, Rodnovery shares Indo-European causal frameworks but uniquely emphasizes Slavic cultural specificity and blood-based ancestral causation. Compared to Germanic heathenry, Slavic Native Faith places greater emphasis on Prav as cosmic law and Rod as unified generative principle, while Germanic traditions emphasize wyrd (fate) and more decentralized divine causation.

*** 1.4.173 Romuva (Baltic) Response

Romuva, the reconstructed Baltic (primarily Lithuanian) native faith, conceptualizes causation through the cosmic ordering principle of Darna (harmony/cosmic law), divine causation by Dievas (sky father) and subsidiary deities, cyclical natural processes, ancestral influence, and the causal efficacy of ritual maintenance of sacred sites and seasonal observances within an interconnected cosmic web.

Baltic paganism maintained continuous practice longer than most European regions, with Lithuania officially adopting Christianity only in 1387. Historical sources include medieval chronicles (Peter von Dusburg's Chronicon Prussiae, 14th century), the 16th-century accounts of Jan Łasicki listing Lithuanian gods, Prussian folk songs (dainas) preserving cosmological elements, and ethnographic documentation by Jonas Basanavičius (1851-1927) and Jonas Balys. Modern Romuva revival was initiated by Vydūnas (1868-1953) and formally established by Jonas Trinkūnas in 1967, with contemporary systematization by Inija Trinkūnienė and scholarly support from scholars like Gintaras Beresnevičius.

The cosmological framework includes Dievas as supreme sky deity representing cosmic order, Perkūnas (thunder) as active causation, Žemyna (earth mother) as material causation, and Velnias/Vėlinas representing transformative underworld causation. The cosmic tree (Austras koks or World Tree) represents the vertical causal axis connecting celestial, earthly, and chthonic causation.

Core arguments include: (1) Darna as cosmic law: causation operates through inherent harmony and balance (Darna)—actions aligned with natural order produce positive effects, while violations generate suffering through cosmic self-correction. This principle applies to individual ethics, social relations, and environmental interaction. (2) Polytheistic causation: different deities govern different causal domains—Perkūnas causes thunder, rain, and justice; Laima determines individual fate at birth; Gabija causes domestic prosperity or destruction through fire—requiring appropriate ritual attention to each causal agent. (3) Sacred site causation: alkvietės (sacred groves), šventvietės (sacred places), and ritual maintenance of natural sites maintain positive causal flow between divine and human realms, with site desecration disrupting regional causation and prosperity.

The concept of laimė (fate/fortune) represents individual causal trajectory shaped by the goddess Laima at birth, ancestral influence, and personal choices. The principle "Kaip pasiūsi, taip piovei" (as you sow, so shall you reap) expresses agricultural-based causation ethics.

Internal variations include debates between monotheistic interpretations (Dievas as supreme cause with other deities as aspects) versus polytheistic (independent divine causal agents), tensions between folklore-based reconstruction and conscious innovation, and differences between Lithuanian Romuva, Latvian Dievturība, and Prussian reconstructions emphasizing different deities and practices.

Counter-arguments to Christian linear causation emphasize cyclical cosmic renewal through seasonal rites maintaining perpetual cosmic order. The critique of Christianity includes rejecting guilt-based causation for balance-based natural consequences. Contemporary applications include ecological activism based on sacred site causation requiring nature protection, seasonal festivals maintaining cosmic causal cycles, and folk medicine preserving traditional causal diagnosis through natural observation and herbal knowledge.

Compared to Slavic Native Faith, Romuva maintains more documentation of pre-Christian practice and emphasizes Darna (harmony principle) more explicitly. Compared to Germanic heathenry, Baltic tradition shows less emphasis on heroic individual fate (wyrd) and more on communal harmony and natural cycles. Compared to Finnish paganism, Baltic tradition maintains stronger Indo-European sky-father theism while sharing Baltic-Finnic cultural influences in practical folk causation beliefs.

*** 1.4.174 Kemeticism (Egyptian Revival) Response

Kemeticism, the revival of ancient Egyptian religious practice, conceptualizes causation through Ma'at (cosmic order, truth, justice), divine causation by Netjeru (gods) according to their specific domains, the causal efficacy of heka (sacred energy/magic), cyclical cosmic processes centered on solar and Osirian cycles, and the causal relationship between ka (life force) and physical manifestation.

Ancient Egyptian causation philosophy developed over three millennia (c. 3100 BCE-395 CE), articulated in Pyramid Texts (c. 2400-2300 BCE), Coffin Texts (c. 2100-1800 BCE), Book of the Dead (c. 1550 BCE onward), and temple inscriptions. Modern revival began with esoteric movements in the 19th century but took serious reconstructionist form in the 1970s-1980s through groups like the House of Netjer (founded 1988 by Tamara Siuda) and the Kemetic Orthodox faith, drawing on Egyptological scholarship including translations by Raymond Faulkner, philosophical analysis by Jan Assmann, and practical reconstructions by Richard Reidy.

The cosmogonic texts describe causation emerging from Nun (primordial waters) through Atum's self-generation, establishing the principle of divine causation through will and word. The Memphite Theology (inscribed 700 BCE, possibly preserving much older tradition) presents Ptah creating through heart (thought) and tongue (speech), emphasizing mental causation preceding physical manifestation.

Core arguments include: (1) Ma'at as cosmic causation principle: the universe operates through Ma'at (order, truth, reciprocity)—actions aligned with Ma'at maintain cosmic stability, while isfet (chaos, falsehood) generates destructive consequences requiring ritual restoration. The concept parallels dharma and rta but uniquely emphasizes social justice and truth-speaking as causal factors. (2) Heka as operative causation: heka (often translated as magic but more accurately sacred effectiveness) represents the energy through which causation operates—gods use heka to create and sustain the cosmos, humans access heka through proper ritual and invocation to effect causal changes. (3) Ka-based causation: every being possesses ka (life force) as causal principle animating matter—causation operates through ka interactions, with offerings providing sustenance to ka of deceased and gods, maintaining causal relationships across the living-dead boundary.

The Book of the Dead, Spell 125 presents the Negative Confession and weighing of the heart against Ma'at's feather, indicating moral causation where ethical violations create measurable consequences. The Instruction of Ptahhotep states: "Ma'at is great, its effectiveness lasting; it has not been disturbed since the time of Osiris."

Internal variations include debates between Kemetic Orthodox maintaining reconstruction of ancient practice versus eclectic Kemetics incorporating modern metaphysics, monotheistic interpretations (all Netjeru as aspects of one divine principle) versus polytheistic (independent divine causal agents), and tensions between mystical versus reconstructionist approaches to heka causation.

Counter-arguments to mechanistic materialism emphasize heka as demonstrable through ritual efficacy and the causal primacy of consciousness (Ptah's mental creation). Contemporary applications include Ma'at-based social justice activism, heka practices for personal development and manifestation, and eco-spiritual perspectives on cosmic balance.

Compared to Mesopotamian religion, Kemeticism maintains more optimistic cosmic order (Ma'at) versus Mesopotamian divine caprice. Compared to Hellenism, Egyptian revival emphasizes cosmic justice (Ma'at) and cyclical maintenance versus Greek philosophical causation debates. Compared to other African traditional religions, Kemeticism represents ancient urban civilization's systematized causation theology versus primarily oral tribal traditions, though sharing concepts of vital force (ka paralleling concepts like ashe).

*** 1.4.175 Hellenism (Greek Revival) Response

Hellenism (Greek religious revival) conceptualizes causation through a hierarchy from transcendent principles (arche, logos) to divine causation by Theoi (gods) to natural causation (physis), emphasizing the interplay of necessity (ananke) and intellect (nous), rational cosmic order (logos/kosmos), and the causal relationship between virtue (arete) and flourishing (eudaimonia).

Ancient Greek causation philosophy developed from archaic theistic causation (Homer, 8th century BCE; Hesiod's Theogony, 7th century BCE) through philosophical systematization by Presocratics (6th-5th centuries BCE), sophisticated analysis by Plato (428-348 BCE) and Aristotle (384-322 BCE), and religious-philosophical synthesis in Neoplatonism by Plotinus (204-270 CE), Iamblichus (245-325 CE), and Proclus (412-485 CE). Modern revival began with Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes (1997) in Greece and diverse groups including Hellenion (US-based, founded 2001), drawing on classical texts and archaeological evidence, with contemporary theologians like Vlassis G. Rassias systematizing traditional practice.

Homer's epics present divine causation where gods directly intervene while humans exercise limited agency. Hesiod's Theogony describes cosmogonic causation from Chaos through successive divine generations. Plato's Timaeus presents the Demiurge ordering pre-existing matter according to eternal Forms, establishing formal causation as primary. Aristotle's four causes (material, formal, efficient, final) provided the classical framework. Plotinus' Enneads describes emanationist causation from the transcendent One.

Core arguments include: (1) Hierarchical causation: reality cascades from transcendent divine principles (Proclus' chain of causation: One → Intellect → Soul → Nature → Matter), with higher causes more potent and comprehensive than lower effects. The Theoi occupy intermediate positions as both caused (emanating from higher principles) and causing (governing natural domains). (2) Teleological causation: the cosmos operates toward ends (teloi)—natural entities have inherent purposes, and causation includes final causes drawing actualization from potentiality. Human flourishing (eudaimonia) results from living according to nature and virtue, representing causal alignment with cosmic purpose. (3) Rational cosmic order: logos (rational principle) structures cosmic causation making it intelligible—the same rational structure governs thought and reality, enabling knowledge of causation through philosophy and mathematical reasoning.

Plato's Phaedo 98-99 criticizes purely mechanistic causation, arguing true causes are purposes and reasons. Aristotle's Physics II defines nature as internal principle of motion and rest, establishing immanent teleological causation. The Chaldean Oracles present theurgical causation where ritual invocations produce effects through divine sympatheia (cosmic sympathy).

Internal variations include tensions between philosophical Hellenism emphasizing logos and natural causation versus cultic Hellenism emphasizing divine intervention and ritual causation, recon movements maintaining ancient practice versus eclectic incorporating modern Neoplatonic philosophy, and debates about divine personality (personal gods) versus divine principles (abstract forces).

Counter-arguments to monotheistic creatio ex nihilo emphasize eternal matter and cyclical time, rejecting temporal creation causation. Against pure materialism, Hellenists argue formal and final causes are irreducible. Contemporary applications include virtue ethics based on character causation of flourishing, philosophical spiritual exercises (askesis) causing psychological transformation, and ecological perspectives viewing nature as ensouled and purposive.

Compared to Roman religion, Hellenism maintains stronger philosophical systematization of causation. Compared to Kemeticism, Greek revival emphasizes rational intelligibility and philosophical inquiry versus Egyptian emphasis on Ma'at maintenance through ritual. Compared to Abrahamic traditions, Hellenism maintains polytheistic causation, cyclical time, and philosophical reason alongside divine revelation as paths to understanding causation.
