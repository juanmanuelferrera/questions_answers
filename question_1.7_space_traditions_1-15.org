* Question 1.7: What is Space?

*** 1.7.1 Catholic Response

The Catholic tradition understands space as God's created framework for material existence, neither an absolute container independent of God nor merely relational, but a divinely established order enabling corporeal being and divine omnipresence. This position synthesizes Aristotelian hylomorphism with Christian revelation, affirming that space derives its reality from God's creative act while possessing genuine ontological status as the extension of material creation.

Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) established the foundational Catholic position in his Summa Theologica, arguing that place (locus) constitutes the relationship between bodies and their immediate surroundings, while rejecting both void spaces and absolute containers. His synthesis of Aristotelian physics with Christian theology maintained that God exists "in all things by His essence, presence, and power" (ST I, q.8, a.3), transcending spatial categories while grounding spatial relations. Later, Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) developed sophisticated distinctions between imaginary and real space in his Disputationes Metaphysicae, arguing that space possesses a conceptual reality even when unoccupied, preparing Catholic thought for engagement with modern physics.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church affirms that "God is infinitely greater than all his works" (CCC 300), establishing divine transcendence over spatial limitation while acknowledging creation's genuine reality. Genesis 1:1's "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" grounds the doctrine that space belongs to creation, not to God's essence. The tradition interprets Jeremiah 23:24, "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" as indicating God's immensity—His presence to all places—without implying spatial containment.

Catholic theology distinguishes between God's immensity (capacity to exist beyond all spatial boundaries) and omnipresence (actual presence to all spatial locations). This avoids pantheism while affirming genuine divine presence throughout creation. The tradition addresses Newton's absolute space by emphasizing that space requires material creation for actualization, not serving as an eternal container independent of God.

Contemporary Catholic engagement with relativity theory and quantum mechanics, notably in the work of physicist-theologians like Stanley Jaki (1924-2009), emphasizes the compatibility between spatial relativity and divine transcendence. The tradition maintains that scientific descriptions of spacetime's curvature and quantum non-locality illuminate creation's contingency rather than threatening divine sovereignty. This positions Catholic thought uniquely to integrate modern physics with classical metaphysics, affirming both spatial reality and its ultimate dependence on the creative Word through whom "all things were made" (John 1:3).

*** 1.7.2 Protestant (Reformed) Response

Reformed theology conceptualizes space as a created dimension establishing the theater of God's glory, where divine sovereignty manifests through providential governance rather than spatial containment. John Calvin (1509-1564) articulated this position emphatically, rejecting both spatial limitation of God's essence and crude notions of divine corporeality while affirming that "heaven and earth are filled" with God's presence (Institutes I.13.1). Space serves as the arena where God's decrees unfold, neither constraining divine action nor possessing independent existence apart from God's sustaining will.

Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion established that God's infinity transcends spatial categories: "God's essence is incomprehensible, and his divinity wholly transcends all human senses" (Institutes I.13.1). Yet space remains objectively real within creation, providing the structured context for covenantal history and redemptive action. Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) developed this further in his unpublished notes on "The Mind," arguing that space constitutes a necessary idea arising from God's ubiquitous presence, approaching idealist interpretations while maintaining Reformed commitments to God's sovereignty over all categories of existence.

The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) declares God "infinite in being and perfection" (II.1), establishing that spatial categories cannot circumscribe divine essence. Psalm 139:7-10's "Where shall I go from your Spirit?" grounds the doctrine that God's presence pervades all spatial locations without being contained by them. The Reformed tradition interprets Acts 17:28, "In him we live and move and have our being," as indicating that space itself exists within God's providential ordering rather than God existing within space.

Reformed theology maintains a strong Creator-creature distinction, arguing against both panentheism and absolute space independent of God. Space belongs entirely to the created order, brought into being ex nihilo and sustained moment by moment by divine decree. This addresses Enlightenment deism by emphasizing God's active governance throughout spatial reality, not mere initial creation followed by mechanical operations.

Contemporary Reformed engagement with cosmology, particularly through philosopher-theologians like Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, explores the relationship between divine timelessness and spatial categories. The tradition affirms compatibility between Big Bang cosmology and creation ex nihilo, viewing the finite spatial extent of the observable universe as consistent with God's transcendent infinity. This maintains classical Reformed emphases on divine sovereignty while integrating insights from modern physics regarding space's contingent, dynamic character rather than static absoluteness.

*** 1.7.3 Lutheran Response

Lutheran theology approaches space through the lens of the communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties) in Christology, leading to distinctive claims about Christ's bodily omnipresence and space's relationship to divine presence. Martin Luther (1483-1546) revolutionized spatial theology by arguing that Christ's glorified body exists "at the right hand of God"—a location Luther interpreted not spatially but as sharing divine omnipresence. This christologically-grounded understanding makes space fundamentally a category of creaturely existence that can, through union with divinity, participate in divine ubiquity.

Luther's Von Abendmahl Christi (1528) articulated three modes of bodily presence: circumscriptive (ordinary spatial location), definitive (spiritual presence not bound by dimensions), and repletive (filling all spaces like divinity). This framework addressed sacramental controversies regarding Christ's real presence in the Eucharist while developing broader implications for understanding space itself. Later, Johann Gerhard (1582-1637) systematized Lutheran spatial theology in his Loci Theologici, distinguishing between God's essential immensity and operative omnipresence, arguing that space constitutes the dimensional aspect of material creation through which God works all things.

The Formula of Concord (1577) affirms that "God is a supernatural, inscrutable being, present at the same time in all and in each creature, in all its parts and in each place" (Solid Declaration VII.94). This guards against both Zwinglian symbolic interpretations and Catholic transubstantiation while establishing Lutheran commitments to divine presence throughout spatial reality. Colossians 1:17, "In him all things hold together," grounds the doctrine that space's coherence derives from Christ's sustaining work.

Lutheran theology's multi-modal presence theory addresses questions of how Christ can be bodily present in multiple locations simultaneously during the Eucharist. This requires rejecting strict Aristotelian assumptions about bodies necessarily occupying single spatial locations, instead proposing that glorified humanity can participate in divine spatial transcendence. Critics argue this compromises genuine humanity's spatial limitations.

Contemporary Lutheran engagement with quantum non-locality and field theories finds resonances with traditional claims about divine presence working through rather than being constrained by spatial structures. The tradition maintains that modern physics' dissolution of absolute spatial containers vindicates Luther's rejection of crude spatial literalism while affirming creation's genuine dimensional reality. This positions Lutheran thought to integrate sacramental realism with scientific cosmology, viewing space as the created medium through which divine presence becomes concretely available to creaturely experience through Word and Sacrament.

*** 1.7.4 Anglican Response

Anglican theology conceives space as creation's dimensional expression, approached through via media between Reformed transcendentalism and Catholic sacramentalism, emphasizing both God's radical otherness from spatial limitation and His gracious accommodation to spatial existence through Incarnation and sacramental presence. Richard Hooker (1554-1600) established Anglican foundations in his Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, arguing that God "filleth heaven and earth" not by spatial extension but by power and presence, yet truly indwells creation through grace. Space thus serves as the ordered context for divine self-communication rather than a barrier to transcendence.

The Caroline Divines, particularly Lancelot Andrewes (1555-1626) and John Donne (1572-1631), developed rich theological poetry and prose exploring spatial paradoxes in Christology—how infinite divinity assumes finite spatial existence without diminution. Donne's sermons frequently meditated on divine omnipresence's relationship to spatial particularity, arguing that God's presence to each location remains complete rather than divided. Later, the Cambridge Platonists, especially Ralph Cudworth (1617-1688), explored space as participating in divine ideas, approaching idealist conceptions while maintaining Anglican commitments to creation's genuine ontological status.

The Thirty-Nine Articles (1571) affirm that Christ "ascended into heaven, and there sitteth" (Article IV), requiring Anglican theology to reconcile spatial language about Christ's location with divine omnipresence. Ephesians 4:10 ("He ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things") grounds the doctrine that Christ's spatial transcendence enables rather than contradicts universal presence. The Book of Common Prayer's liturgical language consistently employs spatial metaphors ("lift up your hearts," "heaven and earth are full of thy glory") while catechetical instruction emphasizes these as accommodations to human understanding.

Anglican comprehensiveness accommodates both more Protestant emphases on divine transcendence over spatial categories and more Catholic appreciation for space as the sacramental medium of grace. This via media rejects both deistic removal of God from spatial engagement and pantheistic identification of God with spatial extension. The tradition particularly emphasizes Incarnation as revealing space's capacity to bear divine presence without compromising transcendence.

Contemporary Anglican theology engages scientific cosmology through figures like John Polkinghorne (1930-2021), physicist-theologian who explored relationships between spacetime physics and divine action. The tradition affirms that relativity's demonstration of space's contingency and relatedness harmonizes with classical Anglican emphases on creation's dependence on divine will. This maintains Anglican breadth, allowing diverse perspectives on technical metaphysical questions while insisting on core commitments: space as genuinely created, capable of mediating divine presence, yet never containing or limiting divine essence—a position enabling dialogue between theological tradition and contemporary physics.

*** 1.7.5 Methodist Response

Methodist theology understands space as the arena of sanctification, where divine grace encounters human response in concrete locations and relationships, emphasizing both God's universal presence and His particular working in spaces consecrated by faith, worship, and holy living. John Wesley (1703-1791) approached spatial questions through his doctrine of prevenient grace—God's presence precedes and enables human response throughout all spatial reality, ensuring no location lies beyond divine reach or redemptive possibility. Space thus constitutes not neutral container but grace-permeated context for progressive sanctification.

Wesley's sermon "On the Omnipresence of God" (1788) articulated that God "is in every part of his creation" not by spatial extension but by knowledge, power, and essential presence, filling heaven and earth without spatial limitation. His evangelical Arminianism emphasized that this omnipresence makes grace universally available, contradicting Calvinist notions of limited spatial extent of grace. Later, Methodist theologian William Burt Pope (1822-1903) systematized Wesley's insights in his Compendium of Christian Theology, distinguishing divine immensity (transcendence of space) from omnipresence (presence to all spaces), arguing both are necessary for understanding God's relationship to creation.

Methodist Articles of Religion (adapted from Anglican Articles) affirm Christ "ascended into heaven, and there sitteth until he return" (Article III), while Methodist hymnody—particularly Charles Wesley's compositions—richly explores divine presence filling all space: "He fills all in all." Psalm 139's meditation on divine omnipresence became central to Methodist devotional practice, interpreted as assurance that no circumstances or locations place believers beyond God's awareness and care. Acts 17:27-28 grounds Methodist emphasis on seeking God who "is not far from each one of us."

Methodist theology distinctively emphasizes sanctified space—camp meetings, class meeting rooms, homes where fellowship occurs—as locations where divine presence becomes particularly manifest through communal practice. This avoids crude localization while acknowledging that human experience of God's presence intensifies in certain spatial contexts characterized by faith and holiness. Critics note this risks compromising divine omnipresence's uniformity.

Contemporary Methodist engagement with globalization and environmental theology emphasizes care for spatial reality as stewardship of God's creation. Theologians like Theodore Runyon explore how Wesley's doctrine of universal grace implies ecological responsibility—all spaces matter to God and should matter to believers. The tradition affirms compatibility between scientific understandings of cosmic expansion and Methodist emphasis on God's grace extending throughout creation. This positions Methodist thought to address environmental degradation theologically, viewing space not as mere resource for exploitation but as grace-filled creation requiring faithful stewardship, with sanctification encompassing not only personal holiness but transformed relationships to the spatial world.

*** 1.7.6 Baptist Response

Baptist theology conceptualizes space as the created dimension wherein autonomous individuals encounter God directly without institutional or sacramental mediation, emphasizing local church gathered in particular spaces over hierarchical spatial structures and affirming that divine presence manifests wherever believers assemble in Christ's name. This understanding emerged from Baptist commitments to congregational autonomy and soul competency—each person's direct accountability before God regardless of spatial location or institutional affiliation.

Early Baptist confessions, particularly the First London Confession (1644) and Second London Confession (1677), affirmed God as "infinite in being" (2LC II.1), transcending spatial limitation while being "everywhere present" through power and knowledge. Baptist pioneers like John Smyth (1570-1612) and Thomas Helwys (1575-1616) rejected ecclesiastical geography—the notion that grace flows through particular institutional spaces or locations—arguing instead that "where two or three gather" (Matthew 18:20) constitutes the church regardless of consecrated buildings. Later, Baptist theologians like John Gill (1697-1771) and Andrew Fuller (1754-1815) developed sophisticated accounts of divine immensity compatible with Reformed theology while maintaining Baptist distinctives about unmediated divine presence.

Scripture memory practices emphasizing Jeremiah 23:23-24 ("Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him?") ground Baptist conviction that no institutional spatial structures mediate divine presence. The tradition interprets John 4:21-24 ("Neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... God is spirit") as rejecting sacred geography in favor of spiritual worship accessible anywhere.

Baptist ecclesiology distinctively emphasizes the gathered local church in particular spatial locations as the normative expression of Christ's body, rejecting both universal church hierarchy and abstract spiritualized ecclesiology. Each congregation possesses full authority within its space, not deriving legitimacy from connection to other spatial locations or apostolic geography. This creates tension between local spatial autonomy and universal spiritual unity.

Contemporary Baptist engagement with digital technology and virtual churches raises questions about space's necessity for authentic ecclesial existence. Some Baptists argue physical gathering in shared space remains essential for biblical church practice, citing Hebrews 10:25 ("not neglecting to meet together"). Others suggest technology extends rather than replaces spatial gathering. The tradition generally maintains that while God's presence transcends physical space, embodied human nature requires spatial contexts for genuine community. This positions Baptist thought to engage questions about virtual reality and digital presence while maintaining historical emphases on local, physical, autonomous congregations as the normative spatial expression of Christian faith.

*** 1.7.7 Pentecostal Response

Pentecostal theology understands space as the dynamic arena of Spirit manifestation, where divine presence breaks into ordinary locations through charismatic phenomena, transforming mundane spaces into sites of encounter with God's power. This pneumatocentric approach emphasizes God's immanent activity throughout spatial reality while maintaining transcendence, with particular locations becoming thin places where heaven touches earth through Spirit outpouring. Space thus possesses sacramental potential not through institutional consecration but through spontaneous divine initiative.

Early Pentecostal leaders like William J. Seymour (1870-1922), whose Azusa Street Revival (1906-1909) became paradigmatic, experienced particular locations as charged with divine presence—a humble Los Angeles mission became the birthplace of a global movement. This demonstrated that God sanctifies spaces through Spirit activity rather than architectural grandeur or ecclesiastical authority. Later Pentecostal theologians like Amos Yong developed sophisticated pneumatologies exploring how Spirit presence relates to spatial categories, arguing in Spirit of Creation (2011) that the Spirit who "hovered over the waters" (Genesis 1:2) remains actively present throughout cosmic space, making creation inherently open to divine manifestation.

Pentecostal interpretation of Acts 2:1-4 emphasizes that Spirit outpouring occurred "when they were all together in one place"—physical gathering in shared space enabled corporate reception of Pentecost. Joel 2:28-29, "I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh," grounds the doctrine that Spirit manifestation knows no spatial boundaries of race, class, or geography. The tradition reads John 3:8 ("The wind blows where it wishes") as indicating Spirit's sovereign freedom to manifest in any location, not confined to consecrated institutional spaces.

Pentecostal practice distinctively emphasizes space's transformation through Spirit presence—ordinary buildings become sites of healing, prophecy, and divine encounter. This democratizes sacred space, rejecting hierarchical control of particular locations while acknowledging experiential differences between Spirit-filled and Spirit-quenched environments. Critics argue this risks subjectivizing spatial categories or creating new implicit hierarchies of "anointed" locations.

Contemporary Pentecostal engagement with megachurch architecture and prosperity theology raises questions about relationship between physical space and Spirit presence. Some emphasize impressive facilities as appropriate offerings to God, while others maintain that Spirit moves most powerfully in humble spaces. Global Pentecostalism's explosive growth in developing nations often occurs in makeshift spaces—homes, storefronts, outdoor meetings—demonstrating that Spirit presence requires no architectural prerequisites. This positions Pentecostal thought to emphasize accessibility of divine encounter across all spatial contexts while maintaining that gathering in physical space remains essential for corporate Spirit manifestation, as technology cannot replicate embodied, pneumatic presence.

*** 1.7.8 Seventh-day Adventist Response

Seventh-day Adventist theology conceptualizes space through its eschatological framework and sanctuary doctrine, understanding earthly space as a temporary sphere corresponding to and influenced by heavenly spatial realities, with the sanctuary serving as the cosmic focal point of God's redemptive activity across spatial dimensions. This cosmology emphasizes a three-tiered universe—earth, heaven, and the heavenly sanctuary—where spatial categories retain literal significance while participating in prophetic fulfillment and cosmic conflict between good and evil.

Ellen G. White (1827-1915), whose writings Adventists regard as authoritative guidance, articulated visions of heavenly spaces with remarkable specificity, describing the heavenly sanctuary's architecture and Christ's movement between its compartments as corresponding to redemptive historical phases. Her book The Great Controversy (1888) depicts cosmic conflict unfolding across spatial realms—earth, heaven, and the intermediate spaces where spiritual warfare occurs. Later Adventist theologians like M.L. Andreasen (1876-1962) developed systematic presentations of sanctuary doctrine in books like The Sanctuary Service (1937), arguing that earthly tabernacle's spatial structure (outer court, holy place, most holy place) corresponds precisely to heavenly realities where Christ ministers.

Adventist interpretation of Hebrews 8:1-2 emphasizes that Christ serves "in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man," indicating genuine spatial structures in heaven, not merely metaphorical concepts. Daniel 8:14's reference to the sanctuary being "cleansed" after 2,300 prophetic days grounds Adventist doctrine that Christ entered the heavenly Most Holy Place in 1844, initiating investigative judgment. Revelation 11:19's vision of "the temple of God in heaven" confirms heavenly sanctuary's spatial reality.

Adventist cosmology distinctively maintains that heaven occupies a literal spatial location, though beyond current observational capacity, where God's throne exists as a specific place. This rejects purely spiritual interpretations of heavenly existence, insisting on concrete spatial categories persisting in glorified creation. The tradition anticipates New Jerusalem descending spatially to a renewed Earth (Revelation 21:2), not ethereal escape from spatial existence but its redemption and transformation.

Contemporary Adventist engagement with modern cosmology explores relationships between biblical cosmology and scientific descriptions of the universe's structure. Some Adventist scholars propose that heavenly realms might occupy dimensions beyond the four of spacetime, harmonizing scriptural literalism with contemporary physics. The tradition maintains young-earth creationism, understanding cosmic space as relatively recent creation (approximately 6,000 years) despite light from distant stars, proposing various solutions including created light in transit or variable light speed. This positions Adventist thought distinctively within Christianity, maintaining robust spatial literalism about heavenly realities while engaging scientific challenges to traditional cosmological timescales.

*** 1.7.9 Jehovah's Witnesses Response

Jehovah's Witnesses theology understands space as Jehovah's universal creation, governed by divine laws and occupied by various orders of spirit creatures inhabiting invisible realms alongside visible material creation. Space encompasses both the physical universe accessible to human senses and spirit realms where angels and demons operate, all under Jehovah's sovereign control. The organization's publications emphasize that space demonstrates intelligent design, providing evidence against evolutionary cosmology while affirming that the universe's vastness manifests Jehovah's glory and power.

The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society's systematic theology, articulated in publications like Insight on the Scriptures (1988), teaches that Jehovah exists "in the heavens" (Psalm 115:3) as a definite location while exercising universal sovereignty. This rejects traditional Christian doctrines of God's immateriality and spatial transcendence, instead proposing that Jehovah possesses a spiritual body located in a specific heavenly place. Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916), the organization's founder, and subsequent presidents like Joseph Rutherford (1869-1942) emphasized that heaven constitutes an actual location where spirit creatures dwell, accessed by Christ after his resurrection and by the 144,000 anointed ones after their heavenly resurrection.

Witnesses interpret Isaiah 66:1 ("Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool") as indicating Jehovah's location in the heavens while exercising authority over earth. John 14:2-3's reference to "my Father's house" with "many rooms" grounds the doctrine that heaven possesses spatial structure accommodating Christ and the anointed class. The organization emphasizes that Acts 7:49 demonstrates heaven as a literal place, not an immaterial state of being.

Jehovah's Witnesses distinctively teach that faithful humans' eternal destiny involves earthly paradise, not heavenly existence—only the 144,000 anointed occupy heavenly spaces, while the "great crowd" (Revelation 7:9) inherits restored Earth. This creates a two-tier eschatological geography: heaven for the ruling class, earth for everyone else. Space thus divides into qualitatively different eternal realms based on one's calling.

Contemporary Watch Tower publications engage scientific cosmology selectively, accepting astronomical observations of the universe's vastness while rejecting Big Bang theory and evolutionary timescales. The organization argues that space's fine-tuning and physical constants demonstrate intelligent design by Jehovah, providing apologetic evidence for creation. The tradition maintains that modern physics' discoveries about space—black holes, cosmic expansion, quantum phenomena—should be evaluated through biblical revelation rather than accepted uncritically. This positions Witnesses uniquely to combine scientific engagement with strong theological filtering, viewing space as divine creation revealing Jehovah's attributes while resisting cosmological theories suggesting self-caused or eternal universes independent of divine creative action.

*** 1.7.10 Latter-day Saints (Mormon) Response

Latter-day Saints theology conceptualizes space through its distinctive materialism, teaching that all reality, including spirit and the divine, consists of refined matter occupying spatial location. Joseph Smith (1805-1844) radically departed from traditional Christianity by declaring, "There is no immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure" (Doctrine and Covenants 131:7-8). This material monism eliminates traditional distinctions between spiritual and spatial existence, proposing instead a continuum of material refinement, with all entities including God occupying definite spatial locations rather than transcending spatial categories.

The Book of Abraham, canonized as LDS scripture, presents a cosmology where gods organize pre-existing matter across spatial realms: "And they (the Gods) organized and formed the heavens and the earth" (Abraham 4:1). This rejects creation ex nihilo, instead proposing eternal matter that gods spatially arrange and refine. Later LDS theologians like James E. Talmage (1862-1933) and B.H. Roberts (1857-1933) developed systematic accounts of LDS cosmology, arguing in Jesus the Christ and The Mormon Doctrine of Deity that God possesses a material, albeit perfected, body located on a planet near the star Kolob, governing the universe through knowledge of natural laws rather than metaphysical transcendence of spatial categories.

LDS interpretation of Acts 7:55-56, where Stephen sees "the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God," emphasizes the literal spatial positioning of distinct divine personages. Doctrine and Covenants 130:22 explicitly states, "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit." This grounds LDS commitment to divine corporeality necessarily implying spatial location and extension.

LDS cosmology distinctively proposes multiple inhabited worlds across space, with gods presiding over different planets and humans potentially progressing to godhood to organize their own worlds. Lorenzo Snow's famous couplet, "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be," implies a spatial cosmology of eternal progression across material realms. This radically democratizes divine status while maintaining spatial hierarchy of authority and progression.

Contemporary LDS engagement with astronomy and space exploration demonstrates enthusiasm for scientific discovery interpreted through LDS cosmological framework. The tradition views evidence of exoplanets and potential for extraterrestrial life as consistent with teachings about multiple inhabited worlds. Some LDS scholars explore quantum mechanics' insights about matter's fundamental nature as potentially illuminating scriptures about refined spiritual matter. This positions LDS thought uniquely within Christianity, embracing robust materialism about all reality including deity while maintaining religious significance of spatial categories, viewing space not as creation from nothing but as the eternal stage for divine organization and human exaltation across infinite progression.

*** 1.7.11 Christian Science Response

Christian Science theology radically redefines space as a false material concept contradicting spiritual reality, teaching that authentic existence is wholly spiritual, with apparent spatial extension representing mortal error to be overcome through spiritual understanding. Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910), founder of Christian Science, articulated this idealist metaphysics in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (1875), declaring, "Spirit is the only substance, the invisible and indivisible infinite God. Things spiritual and eternal are substantial. Things material and temporal are insubstantial" (S&H 335:7-9). Space thus belongs to the illusion of materiality rather than divine reality.

Eddy's theological system, drawing on Berkeleyan idealism while claiming unique Christian revelation, proposes that God (Divine Mind, Principle) constitutes all true reality, with matter including spatial extension representing "mortal mind's" misperception of spiritual truth. Her book elaborates that "Spirit is symbolized by strength, presence, and power, and also by holy thoughts, winged with Love" (S&H 512:24-25), indicating that divine presence operates through consciousness rather than spatial location. Later Christian Science teachers emphasized that healing occurs through recognizing matter's unreality, including spatial diseases and distances, replaced by spiritual understanding of omnipresent divine Mind.

Christian Science interprets John 4:24 ("God is spirit") as excluding all material attributes including spatial extension from divine nature. Genesis 1:31's declaration that creation was "very good" refers to spiritual creation, not material cosmos. The tradition reads 2 Corinthians 4:18 ("we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen") as distinguishing genuine spiritual reality from false material appearances including space.

Christian Science distinctively maintains that spiritual maturity involves transcending spatial concepts—distance, location, and extension all represent limitations of material sense to be overcome. Practitioners report healings occurring instantaneously across distances, demonstrating space's unreality. Critics argue this creates insurmountable problems: human experience overwhelmingly confirms spatial existence, and denying material reality's genuine existence contradicts biblical affirmation of creation's goodness and Incarnation's reality.

Contemporary Christian Science engagement with physics' insights about space's relativity and quantum non-locality finds some resonance with traditional teachings about matter's ultimate insubstantiality. The tradition interprets quantum mechanics' challenges to classical spatial concepts as confirming Eddy's metaphysics, though mainstream physics does not deny spatial reality itself. Christian Science maintains declining membership partly due to difficulty sustaining belief in matter's complete unreality. This positions Christian Science uniquely within Christianity—perhaps most radically idealist, viewing space not as God's creation requiring care but as illusion requiring mental transcendence through spiritual understanding of God's all-encompassing Mind.

*** 1.7.12 Unity Church Response

Unity Church theology understands space as Divine Mind's manifestation, teaching that spatial reality emerges from and remains sustained by universal spiritual consciousness, with material spatial dimensions representing the visible expression of invisible spiritual principles. Charles (1854-1948) and Myrtle Fillmore (1845-1931), Unity's founders, developed New Thought metaphysics proposing that consciousness creates material conditions including spatial relationships, with human minds participating in Divine Mind's creative capacity to shape spatial experience through spiritual understanding and affirmative prayer.

Charles Fillmore's Metaphysical Bible Dictionary (1931) and The Twelve Powers (1930) articulated that the visible universe, including spatial dimensions, proceeds from God's thoughts: "The phenomenal universe is the arbitrary working of the one Mind" (Christian Healing, 1909). This idealist framework maintains that space possesses relative reality as Divine Mind's expression but lacks independent existence apart from consciousness. Unity teaches that humans, as expressions of Divine Mind, can influence spatial circumstances through aligned thought, with demonstrations including healings occurring across distances and manifestation of desired conditions through spiritual consciousness overcoming spatial limitations.

Unity interprets Genesis 1:3 ("Let there be light, and there was light") as demonstrating creation through divine consciousness speaking reality into manifestation, with spatial creation following mental/spiritual precedence. The tradition emphasizes John 1:1-3 ("In the beginning was the Word... all things were made through him") as indicating that Logos (divine idea) precedes and creates spatial reality. Fillmore taught that humanity exists at the "inner side of mind" relative to material space, exercising creative power analogous to divine creativity.

Unity distinctively emphasizes practical metaphysics—applying consciousness principles to transform spatial circumstances including health, prosperity, and relationships. This differs from Christian Science's denial of matter's reality; Unity affirms spatial existence as Divine Mind's legitimate expression requiring harmonization rather than denial. The tradition's affirmative prayer methodology ("affirming truth") aims to align human consciousness with Divine Mind, thereby transforming spatial conditions to reflect spiritual ideals.

Contemporary Unity engagement with quantum physics' observer effect and consciousness studies finds resonances with traditional teachings about consciousness creating material conditions. Unity authors like Eric Butterworth (1916-2003) explored relationships between modern physics and metaphysical Christianity, arguing that quantum non-locality and field theories vindicate Unity's emphasis on spiritual consciousness undergirding spatial reality. The tradition interprets scientific discoveries about space's properties as progressively revealing spiritual principles Unity has long taught. This positions Unity uniquely to integrate scientific and spiritual worldviews, viewing space not as dead matter mechanically operating but as Divine Mind's living expression, responsive to consciousness and capable of transformation through spiritual understanding and aligned thought.

*** 1.7.13 Eastern Orthodox Response

Eastern Orthodox theology conceptualizes space through its theology of energies, understanding spatial creation as participating in God's uncreated energies while God's essence remains utterly transcendent and unknowable. This distinction, articulated definitively by Gregory Palamas (1296-1359), enables Orthodox thought to affirm genuine divine presence throughout spatial creation without compromising divine transcendence or reducing God to a spatial being. Space thus serves as the medium through which God's energies manifest, making creation a theophany—a revelation of divine glory while maintaining the apophatic principle that God's essence infinitely transcends all categories including spatial location.

The Cappadocian Fathers—Basil of Caesarea (330-379), Gregory of Nazianzus (329-390), and Gregory of Nyssa (335-395)—established foundational Orthodox spatial theology, emphasizing that God's infinity means not infinite spatial extension but qualitative transcendence of all limitation. Gregory of Nyssa's On the Soul and Resurrection distinguished divine omnipresence from spatial containment: God surrounds and pervades creation without being bounded by it. John of Damascus (676-749) synthesized patristic consensus in his Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, teaching that God is "in all things by His operation" while remaining essentially beyond all places.

Orthodox theology grounds spatial understanding in the Incarnation and Transfiguration: at Tabor, Christ's divine glory shone through His spatial body, demonstrating how material space can manifest uncreated light. The tradition interprets Colossians 1:16-17 ("in him all things were created... in him all things hold together") as indicating that Logos sustains spatial existence's coherence through divine energies. Orthodox liturgy proclaims space's capacity for divine presence: "Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory."

Orthodox spirituality distinctively emphasizes sacred space—churches consecrated for worship become locations where heaven and earth interpenetrate, not through magic but through the Church's sacramental life and the energies that sanctify material reality. Icons serve as windows between spatial and heavenly realities, demonstrating matter's capacity to mediate divine presence. This differs from Protestant suspicion of sacred space while avoiding Catholic institutional mediation, instead emphasizing cosmic liturgy where all creation potentially participates in divine glory.

Contemporary Orthodox engagement with cosmology, particularly through theologians like John Zizioulas and David Bentley Hart, explores how modern physics' insights about spacetime's relationality resonate with patristic emphases on space as dynamic participation in divine creativity rather than static container. The tradition affirms compatibility between Big Bang cosmology and continuous creation through divine energies. This positions Orthodox thought to maintain ancient spiritual practices involving sacred space while integrating contemporary scientific understanding, viewing space as creation's dimensional aspect ever-sustained by and ever-revelatory of divine energies proceeding from God's inaccessible essence.

*** 1.7.14 Oriental Orthodox Response

Oriental Orthodox theology understands space through its miaphysite Christology, emphasizing the unity of divine and human natures "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation" in Christ's single incarnate nature. This christological lens shapes spatial theology: just as Christ's humanity and divinity unite in one incarnate nature occupying space, so creation participates in divine life without losing its created spatial character. Space thus represents not a barrier between divine and created but the dimension of created existence that God assumes and transforms through Incarnation.

Cyril of Alexandria (376-444), whose Christology Oriental Orthodoxy champions, articulated that Christ's body, while spatially located, possessed divine properties through the hypostatic union, enabling his flesh to be "life-giving" beyond normal creaturely limitations. This established that spatial existence need not limit divine presence or activity when assumed into personal union with divinity. Severus of Antioch (465-538) developed this further against Chalcedonian formulations, arguing that mia physis (one nature) Christology better preserves the reality that divinity fully inhabits and transforms spatial human existence without being constrained by it. Later Ethiopian Orthodox theologians explored how Christ's presence in the Eucharist relates to spatial categories, maintaining real presence without crude localization.

Oriental Orthodox reading of John 1:14 ("The Word became flesh and dwelt among us") emphasizes that Logos assumed complete spatial humanity including bodily extension, demonstrating space's capacity to bear divine presence fully. The tradition interprets Ephesians 1:23 (the church as "the fullness of him who fills all in all") as indicating Christ's presence extending throughout spatial creation through His Body. Ethiopian Anaphoras (Eucharistic prayers) proclaim divine presence "filling heaven and earth" while remaining essentially beyond containment.

Oriental Orthodox distinctively emphasize the Incarnation's permanent transformation of matter-spirit relationships. Christ's glorified body, while spatial, now participates eternally in divine life, suggesting space itself undergoes eschatological transfiguration rather than abolition. Sacred spaces—especially ancient churches and monasteries—become locations where this already-inaugurated transformation is liturgically realized and experienced through Eucharist and prayer.

Contemporary Oriental Orthodox engagement with cosmology remains relatively limited compared to other traditions, partly due to churches' locations in regions facing political challenges. However, theologians like Metropolitan Bishoy of Damiette explore relationships between biblical cosmology and modern science, generally affirming that scientific descriptions of space's properties do not contradict essential theological commitments about creation's goodness and dependence on divine will. The tradition maintains that Christology provides the hermeneutical key for understanding space—not abstract metaphysics but the concrete reality of divine Logos assuming spatial existence, demonstrating that materiality including spatial extension can be fully united with divinity without either being compromised or confused.

*** 1.7.15 Assyrian Church of the East Response

The Assyrian Church of the East's theology approaches space through its distinctive dyophysite Christology, emphasizing the two natures of Christ existing in union (qnoma) while maintaining their distinct properties. This theological framework shapes spatial understanding: divine nature transcends spatial categories while human nature necessarily occupies space, with both coexisting in Christ's person without mixture or confusion. Space thus belongs properly to created existence, never constraining divine nature even when divinity unites with humanity that occupies space. This preserves both divine transcendence and genuine Incarnation's spatial reality.

Nestorius (386-450), whose teachings the Church of the East preserved after his condemnation at Ephesus (431), articulated that Christ's divine nature could not be spatially circumscribed or suffer, while His human nature experienced normal spatial existence. Theodore of Mopsuestia (350-428), venerated in the tradition, developed sophisticated accounts of how Christ's two natures operate, maintaining that divine Logos dwells in the man Jesus like the fullest possible indwelling, enabling works beyond human capacity while respecting each nature's properties. This prevented attributing spatial limitation to divinity while affirming genuine spatial humanity.

The Church of the East interprets Luke 2:7 (Christ "laid in a manger") and similar passages emphasizing spatial particularity as applying to Christ's human nature, while understanding John 3:13 ("No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man") as indicating divine nature's simultaneous transcendence of spatial limitation. The Liturgy of Addai and Mari, among Christianity's oldest Eucharistic prayers, proclaims God's presence "from ages to ages" while acknowledging creation's spatial and temporal character.

The Church of the East's dyophysite Christology creates distinctive implications for understanding sacred space and divine presence. The tradition emphasizes that divine presence in the Eucharist occurs through sacramental union rather than physical transformation or spatial localization of deity, maintaining clear distinction between divine and created even in their closest union. This differs from both Catholic transubstantiation and Protestant symbolism, proposing a third way emphasizing mystical union preserving distinct natures.

Contemporary Assyrian Church engagement with modern cosmology remains limited partly due to the church's dramatic decline following centuries of persecution and geographic isolation. However, the tradition's emphasis on divine transcendence of spatial categories while affirming spatial creation's genuine reality positions it well for dialogue with physics' insights about space's relational and dynamic character. The church maintains that scientific investigation of space's properties explores created reality's structures without threatening theological commitments about divine transcendence. This reflects the Church of the East's historical openness to philosophical and scientific learning during its medieval flourishing, when Assyrian Christians contributed significantly to preserving and transmitting Greek learning including spatial physics to Islamic civilization.
