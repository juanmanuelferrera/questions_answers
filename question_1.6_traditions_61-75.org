*** 1.6.61 Sabbatean Judaism Response

Sabbatean Judaism, following the messianic movement of Shabbetai Tzvi (1626-1676), conceives time as fundamentally paradoxical, wherein the messianic rupture has already occurred yet remains concealed, creating a dual temporal reality where redemptive time coexists with historical time. This radical understanding emerged from the crisis of Shabbetai Tzvi's conversion to Islam in 1666, which believers reinterpreted not as apostasy but as a descent into the realm of kelipot (husks) necessary for cosmic redemption.

The movement's temporal theology developed through Nathan of Gaza (1643-1680), who articulated the doctrine of "redemption through sin," arguing that the Messiah must violate Torah to extract sparks trapped in evil realms, thereby inverting conventional Jewish temporal teleology. Abraham Miguel Cardoso (1626-1706) further developed this theology, proposing that true messianic time operates according to different laws than ordinary historical time. Nehemiah Hiyya Hayon (1655-1730) systematized these ideas, arguing that the apparent contradiction between Shabbetai's apostasy and messianic claims revealed time's true dialectical nature.

Sabbatean texts, particularly Nathan's "Treatise on the Dragons" and various secret writings preserved in the "Hemdat Yamim," articulate a kabbalistic temporal framework derived from Lurianic concepts but radically reinterpreted. Where Isaac Luria saw tikkun (repair) as gradual restoration, Sabbateans viewed the messianic moment as instantaneous yet hidden transformation. Time itself underwent redemption in 1666, though its effects remain veiled until final revelation.

The core argument posits that redemptive time operates inversely to ordinary time—what appears as degradation (Shabbetai's conversion) actually constitutes elevation. This paradoxical temporality justified antinomian practices as accelerating redemption by deliberately violating prohibitions. The theological warrant derived from Lurianic teaching that the Messiah's soul must descend to the deepest depths, reinterpreted as requiring actual transgression.

Internal variations divided believers: radical Sabbateans (Dönmeh) maintained secret conversion while performing Islam outwardly; moderate followers like Moses Hagiz (1671-1750) rejected the movement entirely; crypto-Sabbateans preserved beliefs secretly within normative Judaism. Critics, particularly Jacob Emden (1697-1776), argued this temporal theory destroyed Judaism's ethical foundation by severing action from consequence.

Contemporary scholarship by Gershom Scholem documented how Sabbatean temporal paradox influenced later Jewish mysticism and, arguably, secular messianic movements. This conception resembles Hegelian dialectical temporality where contradiction drives historical progress, though Sabbateanism grounds paradox in divine mystery rather than rational necessity. The movement demonstrates how messianic expectation can transform temporal consciousness when confronting cognitive dissonance between prophecy and historical reality.

*** 1.6.62 Frankist Judaism Response

Frankism, the eighteenth-century movement led by Jacob Frank (1726-1791), conceives time as triadic progression through three successive revelations—Torah, Gospel, and "Life" (Frank's new dispensation)—wherein each epoch transcends and annuls the previous, creating a revolutionary temporal framework that subordinates Jewish tradition to evolutionary spiritual development. This radical historicism emerged from Sabbatean roots but radicalized the temporal paradox into explicit antinomianism and religious syncretism.

Jacob Frank proclaimed himself the reincarnation of Shabbetai Tzvi's soul, teaching that the messianic age required complete destruction of existing religious structures. His temporal theology, preserved in the "Sayings of the Lord" (Słowa Pańskie), posited that time progresses through necessary stages of revelation, each requiring violation of the previous epoch's laws. Unlike traditional Jewish cyclical-linear synthesis, Frank advocated pure progressivism where the future utterly negates the past.

The movement's development involved Frank's strategic conversions—first to Islam (following Dönmeh precedent), then to Catholicism (1759), which followers interpreted not as apostasy but as temporal progression beyond Judaism. Frank's closest disciples, including his daughter Eve Frank (1754-1817) who led after his death, elaborated teachings that time itself transformed with each revelation, making former obligations obsolete. This theology justified mass conversion of Polish Frankists to Catholicism while maintaining secret doctrine.

Frankist temporality rests on several arguments: first, that divine truth progressively reveals itself through historical stages, with each epoch superseding predecessors; second, that the Messianic Age requires destruction of "Edom" (existing religious structures) before reconstruction; third, that Frank as the incarnate deity represented the culmination of temporal development, beyond law entirely. Citations came primarily from oral tradition and Frank's sayings rather than textual sources, deliberately rejecting traditional rabbinic authority.

Internal variations proved limited given the movement's centralized authority under Frank, though after his death followers divided between those maintaining Catholic appearances while preserving secret traditions and those fully assimilating into Christianity or secular society. Critics, particularly normative Jewish authorities like Rabbi Jacob Emden, condemned Frankism as complete apostasy masquerading as messianism.

Contemporary analysis by Pawel Maciejko and others reveals how Frankist temporality anticipated modern revolutionary ideologies that envision complete breaks with tradition. This conception parallels Hegelian sublation (Aufhebung) where each historical stage both negates and preserves predecessors, though Frank emphasized pure negation. The movement demonstrates extreme consequences when messianic expectation combines with antinomian theology to produce revolutionary temporal consciousness.

*** 1.6.63 Dönmeh Response

The Dönmeh (Turkish: "converts"), followers of Shabbetai Tzvi who outwardly converted to Islam while maintaining secret Sabbatean Judaism (1666-twentieth century), conceive time as existing simultaneously on two levels—the exoteric temporal order governed by Islamic law (Sharia) and the esoteric messianic time where redemption has already occurred, creating a perpetual double consciousness that renders conventional temporal categories fundamentally inadequate to spiritual reality. This dual temporality emerged necessarily from the founding trauma of Shabbetai's conversion, reinterpreted as sacred mystery rather than apostasy.

The Dönmeh community, concentrated in Salonica, preserved secret teachings through closed transmission across three main sects: Izmirlis (moderates), Jakubis (followers of Yakov Querido, believing him Shabbetai's reincarnation), and Karakaşlar (most radical, practicing ritual wife-swapping as sacred transgression). Each sect developed distinct temporal theologies while sharing the fundamental premise that true messianic time operates hidden within profane historical time. The poet and mystic Osman Baba (1670-1720) articulated early Dönmeh temporal theory, while later figures like Darwish Effendi (flourished 1750s) elaborated the philosophical implications.

Dönmeh liturgy, preserved in Ladino texts like the secret prayer books and hymns (pizmonim), articulated a temporal theology wherein the 1666 conversion marked time's transformation from galut (exile) to geulah (redemption), though this transformation remained hidden from unredeemed perception. Rituals performed on Shabbetai's birthday (Tisha B'Av) celebrated messianic time's eternal present, contrasting with Islam's linear prophetic temporality and Judaism's exile consciousness.

The theological arguments supporting dual temporality include: first, that the Messiah's necessary descent into kelipot (evil husks) requires actual conversion, transforming time itself through apparent transgression; second, that external religious adherence (Islam) conceals but does not contradict internal truth (messianic Judaism); third, that the paradox between outward and inward reflects time's own doubled nature post-messianic advent. These arguments justified maintaining Islamic practice while celebrating Shabbetai's redemptive power secretly.

Internal variations reflected sectarian divisions—Izmirlis emphasized gradual redemption still unfolding, Jakubis believed messianic time fully realized through Querido's incarnation, Karakaşlar practiced radical antinomianism as temporal acceleration. Critics included both Muslim authorities (who occasionally persecuted suspected crypto-Jews) and rabbinic Judaism (which regarded Dönmeh as complete apostates).

Contemporary scholarship by Marc Baer and Cengiz Şişman reveals how Dönmeh temporal consciousness enabled unique adaptation to Ottoman modernity, with many becoming prominent secularists after 1900. This dual temporality resembles Shi'ite taqiyya (concealment) theology and Marrano crypto-Judaism, demonstrating how persecuted communities develop complex temporal theologies to sustain identity across contradictory demands.

*** 1.6.64 Jewish Renewal Response

Jewish Renewal, the contemporary movement founded by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (1924-2014), conceives time as evolutionary spiral wherein ancient tradition continuously reinterprets itself through contemporary consciousness, creating a dynamic temporality that honors historical rootedness while embracing radical innovation, synthesizing traditional Jewish cyclical-linear time with progressive developmental perspectives and mystical eternal present awareness. This "paradigm shift" theology emerged in the 1960s-1970s from Hasidic roots combined with counterculture spirituality and transpersonal psychology.

Schachter-Shalomi, originally trained in Chabad Hasidism, developed Renewal theology through dialogue with contemplative Christianity (Thomas Merton), Sufism, Buddhism, and depth psychology, articulating a "spiritual eldering" concept where time brings wisdom rather than mere aging. His landmark works, particularly "Paradigm Shift" (1993) and "Jewish with Feeling" (2005), propose that Judaism must periodically "download" eternal Torah into contemporary "operating systems." Rabbi Arthur Waskow (b. 1933) contributed political-ecological dimensions, connecting Jewish time cycles with contemporary environmental crises. Rabbi Shefa Gold (b. 1945) developed contemplative practices that dissolve linear time into mystical presence.

Renewal's temporal theology draws on kabbalistic concepts of cyclical spiritual worlds (olamot) reinterpreted through evolutionary cosmology. The traditional Jewish calendar's sanctification of cyclical time receives new meaning as opportunities for consciousness evolution. The movement emphasizes hitlahavut (ecstatic enthusiasm) and devekut (cleaving to God) as mystical present-moment awareness transcending historical time, while simultaneously engaging progressive politics grounded in prophetic temporal vision of justice.

Core arguments include: first, that authentic tradition requires continuous renewal rather than static preservation, making time itself a creative force; second, that the contemporary era represents a new "axial age" requiring fundamental religious paradigm shifts; third, that Jewish cyclical time (Shabbat, holidays) offers antidote to modern linear commodified time; fourth, that mystical practice accesses eternal present underlying temporal succession. These arguments draw warrant from Hasidic teachings on perpetual Torah revelation and kabbalistic doctrines of continuous divine emanation.

Internal variations range from those emphasizing traditional observance with renewed spiritual intensity (neo-Hasidic approach) to those advocating radical ritual innovation and egalitarian practice. Critics from Orthodox Judaism reject Renewal's selective traditionalism as inauthentic; secular Jews sometimes view its mysticism as regressive; some feminists critique its retention of masculine God-language despite progressive intentions.

Contemporary Renewal communities practice eco-kosher, egalitarian davening, and interfaith engagement as temporal expressions of evolved consciousness. This conception parallels Teilhard de Chardin's evolutionary spirituality and Process theology's becoming-God, sharing conviction that time represents creative advance toward greater complexity and consciousness rather than decline from original perfection.

*** 1.6.65 Neo-Hasidism Response

Neo-Hasidism, the twentieth-century revival and reinterpretation of eighteenth-century Hasidic spirituality by Martin Buber, Abraham Joshua Heschel, and contemporary figures, conceives time as dialectical encounter between eternal divine presence (the "Eternal Thou") and historical human existence, wherein authentic temporality emerges through kavvanah (intentional awareness) that sanctifies each moment while maintaining messianic tension toward redemptive future. This existentialist-personalist reading of Hasidic temporality emerged from early twentieth-century European Jewish intellectuals seeking spiritual resources beyond rationalist and nationalist Judaism.

Martin Buber (1878-1965) pioneered Neo-Hasidism through his collections of Hasidic tales (1906-1928) and philosophical works, particularly "I and Thou" (1923), which reinterpreted Hasidic devekut (cleaving to God) as dialogical presence transcending subject-object temporality. His temporal theology emphasized the "eternal now" of genuine encounter against the "It-world" of instrumental time. Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972), from Hasidic lineage himself, developed complementary theology in "The Sabbath" (1951), conceiving time as "architecture of holiness" wherein sacred temporality (Shabbat) reveals time's true nature as divine gift rather than human resource. Contemporary figures like Arthur Green (b. 1941) have further systematized Neo-Hasidic theology, emphasizing panentheistic mysticism and evolutionary spirituality.

Neo-Hasidic temporal thought draws on classical sources—the Baal Shem Tov's teachings on avodah be-gashmiyut (worship through corporeality), Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's doctrines of the tzaddik's redemptive power, Chabad philosophy's intellectual mysticism—but reinterprets them through modern existentialism, phenomenology, and personalism. The traditional Hasidic concept that "there is no place devoid of Him" becomes panentheistic mysticism where all temporal moments contain divine presence awaiting human awareness.

Core arguments include: first, that authentic temporality emerges through kavvanah transforming mechanical time into sanctified duration; second, that Shabbat represents "palace in time" modeling redeemed temporality within historical existence; third, that hasidut (piety) requires hitlahavut (enthusiasm) that breaks instrumental time's deadening routine; fourth, that the tzaddik's consciousness can elevate collective temporality toward redemption. These arguments cite classical Hasidic texts like "Toldot Yaakov Yosef" and "Tanya" but interpret them through modern philosophical categories.

Internal variations distinguish Buber's existential-dialogical emphasis from Heschel's more traditionally observant mysticism from Green's evolutionary panentheism. Orthodox critics charge Neo-Hasidism with selectively appropriating Hasidic spirituality while abandoning halakhic commitment; rationalist Jews question mystical temporality's coherence; some feminists critique Neo-Hasidism's uncritical transmission of patriarchal texts.

Contemporary Neo-Hasidic communities blend contemplative practice, social justice commitment, and egalitarian innovation, viewing this synthesis as authentic development of Hasidic spiritual democracy. This conception parallels Christian existentialism's "eternal now" (Tillich) and phenomenology's lived time (Bergson), demonstrating modern attempts to recover experiential-mystical temporality against scientific reductionism while maintaining prophetic historical engagement.

*** 1.6.66 Gnosticism (Christian) Response

Christian Gnosticism, the diverse second-to-fourth-century movements blending Christianity with Hellenistic mysticism, conceives time as the malevolent creation of an inferior demiurgic deity, wherein material temporal existence represents imprisonment of divine sparks who must awaken to their eternal origin beyond time through gnosis (saving knowledge), thus radically devaluing historical time and salvation history central to orthodox Christianity. This temporal pessimism emerged from Hellenistic dualism combined with Christian revelation, creating alternative cosmologies that reinterpreted the gospel message.

Early Christian Gnostic teachers like Basilides (flourished 132-135 CE Alexandria) developed elaborate cosmologies wherein time emerged through the fall of Sophia (Wisdom) and the demiurge's subsequent creation, making temporality itself evidence of cosmic error. Valentinus (c. 100-160 CE), perhaps the most influential, taught that time would end when all pneumatic (spiritual) humans received gnosis and returned to the Pleroma (divine fullness), leaving temporal creation to dissolution. Marcion of Sinope (c. 85-160 CE), though doctrinally distinct, shared Gnostic temporal pessimism, radically distinguishing the Old Testament creator god (demiurge) from Jesus's father (true God), thus splitting salvation history.

Christian Gnostic texts, particularly the Nag Hammadi library discovered in 1945, articulate temporal theology through mythological narratives. The "Apocryphon of John" describes time's origin in divine tragedy; the "Gospel of Truth" (possibly by Valentinus) presents gnosis as awakening from temporal nightmare; the "Gospel of Philip" employs sacramental theology wherein baptism, chrism, and bridal chamber represent stages of temporal liberation. These texts reinterpret New Testament imagery—Jesus as revealer rather than redeemer, resurrection as spiritual enlightenment rather than bodily event, Kingdom as present gnosis rather than future coming.

Core arguments include: first, that the created world's evil and suffering prove its creator's inferiority, making time itself fallen; second, that matter inherently opposes spirit, so temporal material existence constitutes exile from eternal spiritual home; third, that Jesus came not to redeem time but to reveal its illusory nature; fourth, that salvation means escaping rather than transforming creation. These arguments challenged orthodox Christianity's affirmation of creation goodness, incarnation, bodily resurrection, and eschatological hope.

Internal variations divided Christian Gnostics into numerous schools—Valentinians emphasized mythological emanation systems; Basilideans developed complex angelologies; Sethians (overlapping group) focused on Seth's divine lineage. Orthodox critics, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons ("Against Heresies," c. 180 CE), attacked Gnostic temporal theology as denying creation's goodness and historical salvation.

Contemporary scholarship by Elaine Pagels and others has recovered Gnostic texts, revealing sophisticated theological alternatives suppressed by emerging orthodoxy. Christian Gnostic temporality resembles Platonic dualism between eternal forms and temporal shadows, but radicalizes the opposition into cosmic warfare. The tradition demonstrates how Christian revelation could combine with dualistic metaphysics to produce complete temporal pessimism contrary to Hebraic affirmation of historical redemption.

*** 1.6.67 Gnosticism (Non-Christian) Response

Non-Christian Gnosticism, encompassing pre-Christian, non-Christian, and post-Christian movements sharing family resemblance of dualistic cosmology and salvific gnosis, conceives time as cosmic imprisonment created by archonic powers who trap divine sparks in material temporal existence, wherein awakening to one's true eternal origin beyond time constitutes salvation, making temporal existence fundamentally alien to spiritual identity. This temporal framework emerged from diverse Hellenistic, Persian, Jewish mystical, and possibly Indian sources, predating and paralleling Christian developments.

Pre-Christian Gnostic speculation appeared in Hellenistic Egypt and Syria, possibly influenced by Persian Zoroastrian dualism and Platonic metaphysics. Simon Magus (first century CE), considered by some patristic sources as proto-Gnostic, reportedly taught a cosmic system involving divine emanations trapped in matter. The Hermetic literature, particularly the "Poimandres" (first-second century CE), presents Gnostic-style cosmology wherein the soul descends through planetary spheres (time-rulers) into bodily imprisonment and must reverse the journey. Mandaeism, surviving to present, preserves pre-Christian Gnostic temporality wherein the soul's ascent from the material world to the lightworld requires navigating dangerous temporal-archonic barriers.

Non-Christian Gnostic texts emphasize time's oppressive nature. Hermetic writings describe planetary archons governing temporal cycles who must be transcended. Mandaean texts like the "Ginza Rba" detail elaborate soul-journey cosmology wherein temporal existence in the "world of darkness" represents temporary exile. The "Apocryphon of John" (though found in Christian contexts, possibly pre-Christian core) describes time's creation by Yaldabaoth, the ignorant demiurge, making temporality itself evidence of cosmic error.

Core arguments include: first, that the soul's divine origin lies beyond temporal creation in eternal lightworld/pleroma; second, that archonic powers created and govern time to maintain souls' imprisonment; third, that gnosis—saving knowledge of one's true identity—enables escape from temporal cycles of reincarnation or bodily existence; fourth, that material creation, including time, fundamentally opposes spirit. These arguments draw on dualistic metaphysics combined with mystical anthropology emphasizing the divine self's alien status in material cosmos.

Internal variations distinguish movements emphasizing: cosmological speculation (elaborate emanation systems); ritual praxis (baptisms, ascent techniques); ethical dualism (extreme asceticism versus libertine antinomianism); cultural matrices (Hellenistic, Persian, Jewish). Mandaeism represents the most distinct survival, maintaining priesthood, rituals, and cosmology relatively independent from Christian influence.

Critics included not only Christian apologists but also Neoplatonic philosophers like Plotinus ("Against the Gnostics," c. 265 CE) who rejected Gnostic temporal pessimism as slandering divine creation. Contemporary scholars debate Gnosticism's origins—indigenous development versus syncretistic borrowing, unified movement versus loose typological category.

Non-Christian Gnostic temporality resembles Buddhist samsara (though debates continue about possible contact) and Orphic transmigration, but radicalizes dualism between time and eternity. The tradition demonstrates how dualistic metaphysics generates temporal pessimism wherein salvation requires escaping rather than redeeming historical existence.

*** 1.6.68 Valentinianism Response

Valentinianism, the sophisticated Christian Gnostic school founded by Valentinus (c. 100-160 CE) representing perhaps the most philosophically developed Gnostic system, conceives time as tragic consequence of Sophia's (Wisdom's) passionate longing to comprehend the unknowable Father, resulting in her fall and the material cosmos's creation by the Demiurge from her suffering, making temporal existence simultaneously fallen yet ultimately redeemable through the salvific gnosis Christ reveals. This complex temporality emerged from Valentinus's synthesis of Christian revelation, Platonic emanation theory, and mythological narrative into a comprehensive theological system that nearly rivaled emerging orthodoxy.

Valentinus, educated in Alexandria and active in Rome (c. 136-165 CE), developed elaborate cosmology involving thirty aeons (eternal beings) constituting the Pleroma (divine fullness). His disciples divided into Eastern (Axionicus, Bardesanes) and Western (Ptolemy, Heracleon) schools, each elaborating the master's teaching. Ptolemy's "Letter to Flora" (c. 160 CE) presents sophisticated hermeneutics distinguishing Old Testament's parts—the perfect God's law, Moses's additions, and elders' traditions—implying developmental temporality within scripture itself. Heracleon (c. 170 CE) wrote the first known New Testament commentary, interpreting John's Gospel through Valentinian temporal-cosmological categories.

Valentinian texts, particularly the "Gospel of Truth" (possibly by Valentinus himself), the "Tripartite Tractate," and Ptolemy's writings preserved in Irenaeus's refutations, articulate a temporal theology wherein creation emerges from divine passion rather than deliberate evil. Sophia's fall creates the Demiurge who fashions time and matter ignorantly but not malevolently. Christ's advent reveals gnosis enabling pneumatic (spiritual) humans to recognize their origin, psychic (soul) humans to achieve salvation through faith and works, and hylic (material) humans' inevitable dissolution.

Core arguments include: first, that time originates in divine passion (Sophia's illegitimate desire) rather than malevolent creation, making it tragic but not simply evil; second, that three classes of humanity relate differently to temporal salvation—pneumatics destined for gnosis, psychics potentially saved through faith (orthodox Christians), hylics incapable of salvation; third, that Christ's mission reveals rather than effects salvation, awakening pre-existent divine sparks; fourth, that temporal history culminates when all pneumatics receive gnosis and return to Pleroma, after which matter dissolves. These arguments preserved Christianity's salvific optimism while maintaining Gnostic dualism.

Internal variations between Eastern and Western schools concerned cosmological details—number of aeons, Sophia's role, Christ's nature. Some Valentinians practiced orthodox-appearing Christianity (attending church, performing sacraments) while maintaining esoteric teaching, creating two-tiered temporal theology—exoteric historical salvation for psychics, esoteric immediate gnosis for pneumatics.

Orthodox critics, particularly Irenaeus ("Against Heresies," Books I-II specifically target Valentinians), rejected the elaborate mythology and predestinarian anthropology while acknowledging Valentinianism's theological sophistication. Contemporary scholarship by Elaine Pagels, Christoph Markschies, and Einar Thomassen has recovered Valentinian texts revealing nuanced theology more complex than patristic caricatures suggested.

Valentinian temporality resembles Neoplatonic emanation and return but personalizes the process through mythological narrative. The movement demonstrates how Gnostic temporal pessimism could moderate into tragic optimism maintaining both dualistic metaphysics and ultimate redemptive hope.

*** 1.6.69 Sethianism Response

Sethianism, the major non-Christian or para-Christian Gnostic tradition centered on Seth (third son of Adam) as ancestor of the divine race and revealer of salvific knowledge, conceives time as the Demiurge Yaldabaoth's oppressive creation imprisoning pre-existent souls who must awaken to their eternal origin in the transcendent realm through gnosis transmitted across temporal ages by Seth's spiritual descendants. This temporal framework, evidenced in numerous Nag Hammadi texts (notably "Apocryphon of John," "Gospel of the Egyptians," "Three Steles of Seth"), represents perhaps the earliest systematic Gnostic cosmology, possibly pre-dating Christian developments.

Sethian mythology, developed by unknown second-century teachers possibly in Syria-Palestine or Egypt, presents elaborate theogony wherein the supreme transcendent God emanates divine beings (aeons) including Barbelo (God's first thought) and the Autogenes (self-generated Christ). Sophia's fall produces Yaldabaoth, who ignorantly creates the material cosmos and archonic rulers governing temporal cycles. The "Apocryphon of John" (multiple versions, c. 120-180 CE) provides the fullest Sethian cosmology, describing how Yaldabaoth's world imprisons light-particles that Seth's lineage must liberate. The "Hypostasis of the Archons" and "On the Origin of the World" elaborate Sethian temporal mythology wherein repeated divine interventions (Seth's incarnations) across ages gradually awaken the sleeping pneumatics.

Sethian texts emphasize time's oppressive governance by archons (rulers) who maintain souls' imprisonment through birth-death cycles. The "Apocalypse of Adam" (possibly first century CE, earliest Sethian text) presents Adam's revelation to Seth of salvific knowledge enabling escape from temporal archonic dominion. The "Paraphrase of Shem" describes cosmic history as epochs of light's struggle against darkness, with final conflagration liberating imprisoned spirits. Ritual texts like "Three Steles of Seth" provide contemplative practices for ascending through temporal-spatial realms to reunite with the divine.

Core arguments include: first, that pre-existent souls fell into Yaldabaoth's temporal creation and forgot their origin; second, that Seth and his spiritual descendants (Sethians themselves) preserve and transmit saving gnosis across temporal ages; third, that multiple divine interventions throughout time (Seth, Christ as Seth's avatar) awaken different generations; fourth, that final eschatological crisis will destroy time and matter, liberating all pneumatics. These arguments draw on Genesis reinterpretation (Seth as true spiritual lineage versus Cain/Abel), apocalyptic eschatology, and Platonic metaphysics.

Internal variations distinguish earlier non-Christian Sethianism from later Christianized versions incorporating Christ into Sethian mythology. Some texts ("Trimorphic Protennoia") present feminine divine revealer; others emphasize masculine Logos. Scholarly debate continues whether Sethianism represents pre-Christian gnosis later Christianized or Christian heresy secondarily de-Christianized.

Orthodox critics like Irenaeus and Epiphanius attacked Sethian mythology as blasphemous parody of Genesis. Contemporary scholars including John Turner, Birger Pearson, and Bentley Layton have reconstructed Sethian development, revealing sophisticated theological system independent from yet parallel to Christian orthodoxy.

Sethian temporality resembles Manichaean cosmic dualism and Zoroastrian eschatological battle while uniquely emphasizing lineage-transmission of gnosis through temporal ages. The tradition demonstrates how apocalyptic eschatology could combine with Platonic dualism to produce comprehensive temporal mythology balancing historical interventions with ultimate escape from history.

*** 1.6.70 Marcionism Response

Marcionism, the second-century movement founded by Marcion of Sinope (c. 85-160 CE) representing perhaps early Christianity's most radical reinterpretation, conceives time as fundamentally divided between the Old Testament Demiurge's just but inferior temporal creation and the New Testament God's loving revelation through Christ, utterly severing Christian salvation history from Jewish temporal foundations and rejecting material creation's goodness. This theological dualism, while sharing Gnostic temporal pessimism, differs by emphasizing two distinct deities rather than emanation cosmologies, making temporal division absolute and irreparable.

Marcion, a wealthy shipowner from Pontus who came to Rome c. 140 CE and was excommunicated c. 144 CE, developed systematic theology based on the radical distinction between Law and Gospel, Creator and Redeemer, Justice and Love. His "Antitheses" (lost but reconstructed from patristic refutations) contrasted Old Testament passages showing the Creator's capricious justice with Jesus's teachings revealing the true God's love. Marcion created Christianity's first canon—edited Luke Gospel (removing Jewish references) and ten Pauline epistles (excluding Pastorals)—to purge Jewish temporal theology. His churches spread rapidly through the Roman Empire, surviving into the fifth century despite fierce orthodox opposition.

Marcionite temporal theology rejected the Old Testament entirely, viewing its God (Demiurge) as legitimate ruler of material creation but inferior to Christ's Father. The world's creation, biblical history, and Jewish law all belonged to the just but ignorant Demiurge who imprisoned souls in matter. Christ's advent represented absolute novum—the unknown loving God's gracious intervention into alien territory, offering escape from temporal creation through faith. Marcionites practiced severe asceticism, rejecting marriage and procreation as collaboration with the Demiurge's entrapment project.

Core arguments include: first, that the Creator God's characterization in the Old Testament (wrathful, jealous, demanding sacrifice) contradicts Jesus's Father (loving, merciful, self-giving), proving their distinction; second, that material creation's evil and suffering evidence the Creator's incompetence or malevolence; third, that Christianity has no connection to Judaism—Jesus came to humanity enslaved under alien deity, not to fulfill Jewish prophecy; fourth, that salvation means faith-response to grace, not law-obedience or historical participation. These arguments derived primarily from Paul's Law-Gospel dialectic radicalized into absolute opposition.

Marcion's movement remained relatively unified due to his systematic theology, though later Marcionites debated Christology (docetism versus real suffering) and apocalyptic expectations (immediate versus delayed final dissolution). Orthodox critics, particularly Tertullian's five-book "Against Marcion" (c. 208 CE), Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus, vigorously defended creation's goodness, Old Testament authority, and salvation history continuity.

Contemporary scholars debate whether Marcionism represents Christian Gnosticism or distinct phenomenon. Adolf von Harnack famously called Marcion "the only Christian the early church understood," suggesting his Pauline interpretation's coherence though ultimate rejection. The movement significantly influenced canon formation—orthodox Christianity's four-Gospel, broader-epistles canon responded partly to Marcion's restrictive list.

Marcionite temporality resembles Gnostic dualism but emphasizes discontinuity over emanation, rupture over fall. The tradition demonstrates how Christological exclusivism could produce radical temporal theology rejecting creation itself while maintaining Christianity's salvific core, anticipating later antinomian and supersessionist tendencies.

*** 1.6.71 Catharism Response

Catharism, the medieval dualist movement flourishing in southern France and northern Italy (twelfth-fourteenth centuries) before Albigensian Crusade and Inquisition suppression, conceives time as the evil principle (Satan/Rex Mundi)'s material creation wherein pre-existent angelic souls were imprisoned through deception into corporeal bodies, requiring multiple incarnations until receiving the consolamentum (spiritual baptism) and achieving liberation from temporal-material existence through radical ascetic rejection of worldly engagement. This absolute dualism, whether derived from Bogomil influence, independent development, or ancient Gnostic survival, created the most significant medieval alternative to Catholic temporal theology.

Cathar theology developed through traveling perfecti (perfected ones) who transmitted dualist teaching across southern Europe. Key figures included Nicetas, a Byzantine bishop who attended the 1167 Cathar council at Saint-Félix-Caraman, systematizing absolute dualist doctrine distinguishing two co-eternal principles (good/evil, spirit/matter); Guilhabert de Castres (died 1240), Bishop of Toulouse who led Languedoc Cathars during crusade; Bertrand de la Bacalaria (early thirteenth century), whose teachings were recorded in inquisitorial registers. The movement divided between absolute dualists (two co-eternal gods) and moderate dualists (Satan as fallen angel who created matter within God's permission).

Cathar texts survive primarily through hostile Catholic sources, particularly inquisitorial records and polemics like the "Summa Against the Cathars" by Moneta of Cremona (c. 1241) and Dominican inquisitor Bernard Gui's manuals (early fourteenth century). Cathar ritual texts like "The Book of Two Principles" (absolute dualist) and "The Occitan Ritual" preserve theological fragments. Cathars rejected the Old Testament as the evil god's deception, accepted only John's Gospel and portions of New Testament (especially dualistic passages), and interpreted creation narratives as describing souls' entrapment rather than original goodness.

Core arguments include: first, that matter's inherent evil (suffering, decay, death) proves material creation by evil principle; second, that good God could not create evil world—absolute dualists posited two co-eternal gods, moderate dualists emphasized Satan's rebellion and usurpation; third, that souls undergo multiple incarnations (metempsychosis) until achieving perfection through consolamentum; fourth, that temporal history represents ongoing cosmic warfare between light and darkness until final spiritual triumph. These arguments drew on Gospel dualistic language (John, Paul's flesh-spirit dichotomy) radicalized through dualist hermeneutics.

Internal variations divided Cathars into credentes (believers, ordinary followers) and perfecti (perfected, elite ascetics who received consolamentum and practiced strict vegetarianism, celibacy, and poverty). Theological divisions separated absolute from moderate dualists regarding evil's origin and Christ's nature (docetic phantom versus celestial body).

Catholic opponents, particularly Dominican inquisitors and crusaders (1209-1229), waged military and theological warfare. Saint Dominic founded his order partly to combat Cathar heresy through preaching and disputation. Thomas Aquinas's "Summa Contra Gentiles" addressed dualist arguments philosophically.

Contemporary scholarship by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie ("Montaillou") and others, utilizing inquisitorial records, has reconstructed Cathar belief and practice. Cathar temporality resembles ancient Manichaeism's cosmic dualism and Buddhist-style reincarnation while uniquely combining with Christian sacramentology. The movement demonstrates medieval capacity for sustaining radical alternative temporal theology before modern uniformity.

*** 1.6.72 Bogomilism Response

Bogomilism, the medieval Bulgarian dualist movement founded by priest Bogomil (tenth century) that spread throughout Byzantine Empire and influenced Western Catharism, conceives time as Satan's (Satanail's) malevolent creation following his fall from heaven, wherein he fashioned material cosmos including human bodies to imprison angelic souls, making temporal existence fundamentally evil realm from which souls must escape through ascetic rejection of material engagement and reception of spiritual baptism transmitted by elect teachers. This Slavic dualist theology synthesized earlier Paulician teachings, indigenous Slavic cosmology, and heretical Byzantine Christianity into distinctive temporal framework.

Bogomilism emerged in tenth-century Bulgaria under Tsar Peter (927-969), a period of social unrest and Byzantine cultural influence. The priest Bogomil (name means "beloved of God") began preaching dualist doctrine, reportedly synthesizing Paulician refugees' teachings with Slavic religious elements. Presbyter Cosmas's "Sermon Against the Bogomils" (c. 972), our earliest source, describes their beliefs and condemns their rejection of church authority, sacraments, and material creation. The movement spread to Byzantine Empire proper, where Anna Comnena's "Alexiad" (twelfth century) records emperor Alexios I Komnenos's 1099 trial and execution of Bogomil leader Basil, who had gained aristocratic followers. Euthymius Zigabenus's "Panoplia Dogmatica" (c. 1110) provides systematic refutation of Bogomil theology based on examination of captured adherents.

Bogomil temporal theology, preserved in Slavonic apocrypha like the "Secret Supper" (interrogation of John by Jesus, possibly Bogomil origin), describes how Satanail (Satan with divine suffix, indicating original angelic status) rebelled, was cast from heaven, and then created material world as prison for angels he deceived into following him. God permitted this creation, later sending Christ (appearing docetically, without real flesh) to reveal saving knowledge. Time itself represents Satanail's dominion, which will end when all imprisoned souls receive gnosis and ascend, leaving matter to dissolution.

Core arguments include: first, that material creation's evil and suffering prove its creation by fallen angel rather than good God; second, that Satan fashioned human bodies to trap angelic souls he had deceived; third, that the Old Testament describes Satan's deeds while falsely attributing them to God—Bogomils rejected most of it as Satanic deception; fourth, that Christ came to reveal truth and provide spiritual baptism (prayer-laying of hands) enabling escape from Satanaic temporal dominion. These arguments drew on Gospel dualistic passages, especially Johannine literature, interpreted through dualist cosmology.

Internal variations distinguished moderate Bogomils (who believed Satan would eventually be reconciled and Satanail's divine suffix removed, becoming simply "Satan") from absolute dualists (who believed Satan eternally evil). Organizational structure involved elect perfecti practicing extreme asceticism (vegetarianism, celibacy, poverty) and ordinary believers who received consolation only at death.

Orthodox critics, particularly Byzantine theologians and later Catholic inquisitors (as Bogomilism spread to Bosnia and influenced Cathars), attacked the dualist theology as Manichaean revival. The movement suffered periodic persecution but survived in Bosnia until Ottoman conquest, with some communities reportedly converting to Islam as lesser evil than Catholic rule.

Contemporary scholarship by Dmitri Obolensky and others has traced Bogomil influence on Western Catharism and possibly later Balkan folk religion. Bogomil temporality resembles both ancient Gnosticism and Eastern European folk cosmologies, demonstrating how dualist metaphysics could adapt to Slavic cultural context while maintaining theological continuity with earlier movements.

*** 1.6.73 Paulicianism Response

Paulicianism, the Armenian-Byzantine dualist movement originating in seventh-century Armenia and persisting until ninth-century suppression, conceives time as the evil Demiurge's creation fundamentally opposed to the true spiritual God revealed through Christ and especially Paul (whose authority the movement emphasized), rejecting material sacraments, church hierarchy, and corporeal resurrection in favor of spiritual interpretation that devalues temporal-physical existence. This radically anti-materialist theology, possibly derived from earlier Marcionite or Manichaean influences transmitted through Armenian Christianity, created persistent alternative tradition that influenced later Bogomil and Cathar movements.

Paulicianism's founder, Constantine-Silvanus (c. 650s-684), reportedly received a New Testament from a Genesius, was converted to dualist interpretation, and began teaching in Armenia, emphasizing Pauline epistles and Gospel of Luke (following Marcionite precedent). Symeon-Titus succeeded him after Constantine's execution, continuing leadership until 690. The movement underwent persecution, revival, and Byzantine military transplantation—Emperor Constantine V (r. 741-775) relocated Paulicians to Thrace to defend borders, creating Philippopolis (Plovdiv) as major center. The ninth-century leader Sergius-Tychicus established quasi-independent Paulician principality at Tephrike until Byzantine destruction 872. The heresiarch Carbeas and his successor Chrysocheir (died 863, 878 respectively) led Paulician military resistance against Byzantine persecution.

Primary sources for Paulician theology come from hostile accounts—Peter of Sicily's "History of the Paulicians" (c. 870), Photius's "Against the Manichaeans" (ninth century), and Euthymius Zigabenus's "Panoplia Dogmatica" (twelfth century). These sources describe Paulician cosmological dualism distinguishing the evil Creator who made material world (identified with Old Testament God) from the true spiritual Father revealed by Christ. Paulicians rejected Old Testament, veneration of Mary and saints, material sacraments (baptism, Eucharist involved only spiritual significance), church buildings, and cross (as instrument of Christ's suffering).

Core arguments include: first, that matter inherently opposes spirit, making material creation evil demiurge's work rather than good God's; second, that true Christianity follows Paul's spiritual interpretation, rejecting Jewish material practices; third, that Christ appeared docetically (seeming human without actual flesh) because divine spirit cannot unite with evil matter; fourth, that resurrection means spiritual enlightenment rather than bodily revival—temporal body remains forever dead. These arguments derived from radical reading of Pauline spirit-flesh dichotomy and Johannine dualism.

Internal variations apparently distinguished moderate and extreme positions on dualism's absoluteness and the relationship between Old and New Testament gods, though sources provide limited detail. Organizational structure emphasized teachers (didaskaloi) rather than priestly hierarchy, with communities named after Pauline churches (Ephesus, Corinth, etc.).

Orthodox critics, both Armenian and Byzantine, condemned Paulicianism as Manichaean revival. Multiple Byzantine emperors—Theodora especially (r. 842-855)—violently persecuted the movement, reportedly executing 100,000 adherents. The movement survived through military defense and geographical isolation until ninth-century suppression, though remnants may have influenced Bogomilism.

Contemporary scholars debate Paulician origins—indigenous development, Marcionite survival, Manichaean influence, or synthesis. Paulician temporality resembles Marcionite radical discontinuity and Gnostic material pessimism while distinctively emphasizing Pauline authority. The movement demonstrates how Christological and Pauline interpretation could generate dualist temporal theology rejecting material creation while claiming apostolic Christianity.

*** 1.6.74 Manichaeism Response

Manichaeism, the dualist religion founded by the Persian prophet Mani (216-274 CE) that spread from Spain to China becoming late antiquity's most successful missionary religion before eventual suppression, conceives time as finite dramatic cosmic conflict between co-eternal principles of Light and Darkness, wherein Darkness's invasion trapped Light-particles in material creation, making temporal history the process of Light's gradual liberation through knowledge (gnosis) until final separation and time's end. This sophisticated synthesis of Zoroastrian dualism, Buddhist cosmology, Christian soteriology, and Gnostic mythology created comprehensive temporal theology balancing historical progression with cyclical cosmic patterns.

Mani, born in Mesopotamian Elchasaite Jewish-Christian community, claimed revelations from his celestial Twin beginning at age twelve (228 CE) and twenty-four (240 CE), commissioning him as "Seal of the Prophets" after Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. His missionary career (240-274) spread the religion throughout Persia until Zoroastrian priest Kartir secured his execution under Bahram I. Mani's canonical writings (composed in Syriac Aramaic and Middle Persian) included the "Shapurakan" (dedicated to Shapur I), "Living Gospel," "Treasure of Life," and elaborate illustrated cosmology "Ardhang." His disciple and successor Sisinnios continued systematization. Later missionaries like Mar Ammo spread Manichaeism eastward into Central Asia and China (reaching China by 694), where it survived longest (until seventeenth century in reduced form).

Manichaean temporal theology describes primordial separation between Light-realm (God, Father of Greatness) and Dark-realm (Matter, Prince of Darkness), eternally distinct but spatially adjacent. Darkness invaded Light's borders, prompting Light to emanate Primal Man who fought but was partially defeated, his soul-armor captured. All subsequent cosmic history involves Light's strategy for liberating trapped particles while preventing further contamination. The material cosmos itself constitutes machinery for Light's liberation—sun and moon are purified Light repositories; souls ascend through moon to sun to Light-realm. Time proceeds through three epochs: Anterior Time (primordial separation), Middle Time (present mixture), Posterior Time (final separation after all Light extraction).

Core arguments include: first, that evil's existence proves dualism—good God could not create evil, therefore co-eternal evil principle exists; second, that cosmic mixture explains human experience combining spiritual aspiration (trapped Light) with carnal desire (Dark matter); third, that salvation requires ascetic practice liberating Light from material contamination—Elect monastics practicing vegetarianism, celibacy, poverty directly facilitate cosmic liberation; fourth, that religious history represents progressive revelation through messengers (Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Mani) teaching the same eternal gnosis adapted to different cultures. These arguments synthesized Persian, Indian, and Christian elements into comprehensive system.

Internal variations distinguished Elect (rigorous monastics) from Hearers (lay supporters), with different ethical requirements and soteriological destinies—Elect achieved immediate Light-realm reunion, Hearers required reincarnation as Elect. Regional variations developed—Western Manichaeism (Africa, Europe) emphasized Christian elements; Eastern Manichaeism (Central Asia, China) incorporated Buddhist terminology and concepts.

Critics included Zoroastrian priests (who executed Mani), Christian theologians (Augustine's anti-Manichaean writings, 388-400 CE, devastatingly critiqued his former religion), Islamic authorities (who persecuted Manichaeans as heretics), and Chinese Confucian officials (who periodically suppressed it as heterodox foreign teaching).

Contemporary recovery of Manichaean texts (Coptic Cologne Mani Codex 1969, Central Asian fragments, Chinese treatises) has revealed sophisticated theology beyond polemical caricatures. Manichaean temporality uniquely synthesizes cyclical patterns (Buddhist samsara, Zoroastrian cosmic cycles) with linear eschatological finality (Christian apocalyptic), demonstrating ancient globalization's theological consequences.

*** 1.6.75 Mandaeism Response

Mandaeism, the Gnostic religion surviving since antiquity in Iraq and Iran with ancient roots possibly pre-dating Christianity, conceives time as the corrupt material realm of Ptahil (the demiurge) and the planetary archons (rulers) who imprison the divine Light (soul) in bodies through birth and death cycles, while the true lightworld (Mshunia Kushta) exists eternally beyond time, making earthly temporality fundamentally alien to the soul's true home to which it must ascend through ritual knowledge transmitted by the salvific figure Hibil-Ziwa and preserved by the Mandaean community.

Mandaeism's origins remain debated—traditional scholarly view held late antique origins (second-third century CE), possibly from John the Baptist sectarian descendants; recent scholarship by Jorunn Buckley and others suggests earlier origins, possibly first century BCE-CE Palestine before migration to Mesopotamia. The religion's prophet-revealer Hibil-Ziwa (Abel-Ziwa) descended from the lightworld through archonic spheres to teach saving knowledge, paralleling but distinct from Christian Christ. Mandaean priests (tarmidis) preserve elaborate rituals, especially masbuta (baptism, repeated frequently) and masiqta (death mass), transmitting saving knowledge across generations. The priestly lineage claims unbroken succession from John the Baptist, whom Mandaeans revere as authentic prophet (while rejecting Jesus as false prophet and Jewish/Christian scriptures as corrupted).

Mandaean sacred texts, written in Mandaic (Eastern Aramaic dialect), include the "Ginza Rba" (Great Treasure—right side: theological cosmogony, left side: soul's ascent), "Qulasta" (canonical prayer book), "Book of John" (incorporating John the Baptist traditions), and "Haran Gawaita" (legendary historical narrative of community's migration). These texts describe the lightworld's eternal perfection contrasted with the material world's deficiency. Time itself belongs to the planetary archons' dominion—seven planets govern temporal cycles, trapping souls through astrological influence. Ptahil, the demiurge, created material cosmos but is himself created by higher powers, making creation result of error rather than malevolence.

Core arguments include: first, that the soul originates in the eternal lightworld and fell/descended into material temporal imprisonment, requiring gnosis for return; second, that ritual purity (especially frequent baptism in living/flowing water) and moral conduct (truthfulness, charity, avoiding killing) facilitate soul's liberation from temporal archons; third, that death represents soul's dangerous journey through planetary spheres requiring ritual assistance (masiqta prayers) and knowledge of passwords/signs; fourth, that the Mandaean community preserves authentic Nasoraean (Observer/Gnostic) tradition while Christianity and Judaism represent corruptions. These arguments ground in mythological cosmology and ritual praxis rather than philosophical theology.

Internal variations are limited given small community size and priestly authority maintenance, though disputes concern ritual strictness levels and accommodation to modernity (especially diaspora communities post-2003 Iraq war). Geographic separation between Iraqi and Iranian communities historically produced minor liturgical variations.

Contemporary Mandaeism faces existential crisis—violence in Iraq and Iran reduced population from c. 60,000-70,000 (2003) to perhaps 5,000-10,000 in Middle East, with diaspora communities (Australia, Europe, North America) struggling to maintain ritual requirements (living water for baptism, priestly succession) and language transmission. Scholars like Edmondo Lupieri and Nathaniel Deutsch have documented the tradition's unique preservation of ancient Gnostic themes.

Mandaean temporality resembles ancient Gnosticism's archonic cosmology and ritual ascent techniques while distinctively maintaining continuous community transmission, elaborate ritual system, and cultural-ethnic identity beyond purely theological commitment. The tradition demonstrates Gnostic temporal theology's longest survival through integration with ethnic identity and priestly ritual preservation.
