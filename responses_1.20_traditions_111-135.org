*** 1.20.111 Shingon Buddhism Response

In Shingon Buddhism, individual things manifest universal principles through the doctrine of sokushin jōbutsu (becoming Buddha in this very body). Each particular phenomenon is understood as a direct expression of Mahavairocana Buddha's dharmakāya (truth body). The relationship is one of immediate identity rather than participation or representation—individual things ARE the universal, not merely reflections of it.

Kūkai's doctrine of hosshin seppō (the Dharmakāya preaches) establishes that universal truth continuously manifests through all particular forms. The six great elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness) interpenetrate throughout all existence, meaning each individual thing contains the totality of cosmic reality. The universe is Mahavairocana's body, individual phenomena are his gestures (mudras), sounds are his mantras, and thoughts are his mind.

Through the three mysteries (sanmitsu)—body, speech, and mind—practitioners recognize this non-dual relationship. When we perform mudras, chant mantras, and visualize mandalas, we don't symbolically represent universal principles; we actualize them directly in our individual existence. The Garbhadhātu and Vajradhātu mandalas map this relationship: each deity, color, and symbol in these cosmic diagrams simultaneously represents particular aspects and the complete totality. Individual practice with specific ritual forms (kaji) transmits universal enlightenment because the particular contains the universal without remainder. This is not mystical obscurantism but ontological fact—the relationship between individual and universal is one of mutual interpenetration (相即相入) where boundaries dissolve in esoteric realization.

*** 1.20.112 Jodo Shinshu Response

In Jodo Shinshu, individual things relate to universal principles through Amida Buddha's all-embracing compassion and the working of Other Power (tariki). Shinran Shonin taught that each particular being, regardless of karmic status or spiritual capacity, exists within the sphere of Amida's Primal Vow. The universal principle here is not an abstract metaphysical truth but the dynamic reality of boundless compassion directed toward each individual being.

Individual existence becomes meaningful through nembutsu—the recitation of "Namu Amida Butsu." This is not a practice we perform to attain universality, but the manifestation of universal compassion working through our particular, limited selves. Shinran emphasized that even our faith (shinjin) is not individually generated but is the Buddha's faith given to us. The universal principle of enlightenment operates precisely through our acknowledgment of individual incapacity. This paradoxical relationship—that salvation comes through admitting we cannot save ourselves—reveals how the particular and universal interrelate in Pure Land thought.

The concept of jinen hōni (naturalness of dharma) illuminates this further. Individual things follow their nature spontaneously when aligned with Amida's Vow. We don't transcend individuality to reach universality; rather, universal compassion fulfills itself through embracing our particular, foolish selves exactly as we are. The bombu (foolish being) in their very particularity becomes the site where universal enlightenment manifests. This is the essence of Shinran's revolutionary insight: the relationship between individual and universal is not one we establish through effort, but one already established by the Vow that precedes and encompasses all particularity.

*** 1.20.113 Soka Gakkai Response

From the Soka Gakkai perspective rooted in Nichiren Buddhism, individual things relate to universal principles through the doctrine of ichinen sanzen (three thousand realms in a single moment of life). Each individual existence contains the entirety of universal truth—the Mystic Law (Myōhō-renge-kyō). The relationship is neither hierarchical nor participatory but one of complete mutual inclusion. Universal principles don't exist apart from individual manifestations; they are simultaneously particular and cosmic.

Nichiren's teaching that "both oneself and others together will take enlightenment" establishes human revolution as the mechanism connecting individual transformation to universal change. When we chant Nam-myōhō-renge-kyō, we're not appealing to external universal principles but awakening the universal law within our individual lives. Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda developed this into the practice of value creation (sōka), showing that individual human life becomes the arena where universal values—beauty, benefit, and good—are actualized through engaged Buddhism.

Daisaku Ikeda's philosophy of human revolution further articulates this relationship: the transformation of individual character directly influences social and even cosmic reality because the individual microcosm reflects and affects the macrocosm. The ten worlds exist in each moment of life, meaning each individual simultaneously embodies all possible states from hell to Buddhahood. Universal principles of the Lotus Sutra operate through ordinary people's daily struggles and victories. The relationship between individual and universal is dynamic and reciprocal—we manifest universal truth through particular actions, and universal principles find concrete expression only through individual lives engaged in creating value and establishing peace.

*** 1.20.114 Confucianism Response

In Confucian thought, individual things relate to universal principles through the concept of li (理)—the pattern or principle inherent in all existence. Each particular being possesses its own specific li that connects it to the universal Dao (Way). The relationship is one of natural hierarchy and appropriateness—individual things fulfill universal principles by actualizing their proper nature and maintaining correct relationships.

The Five Relationships (wu lun) exemplify this connection. Each particular relationship—ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger, friend-friend—manifests universal moral principles (yi, righteousness) through specific duties and behaviors. The individual person connects to universal virtue through cultivating ren (humaneness), which begins with particular familial affections but extends outward to embrace all humanity. Confucius taught that universal harmony emerges from individuals perfecting their roles and relationships, not from transcending particularity.

The practice of li (禮, ritual propriety) demonstrates how individual actions embody universal order. When we perform rituals correctly, we're not merely following conventions but participating in cosmic harmony. Each gesture, word, and offering has proper form that connects human activity to heavenly patterns. The junzi (exemplary person) achieves this connection through constant self-cultivation (xiushen), studying the classics, and manifesting universal virtues in particular situations. Music, poetry, and ritual study train individuals to recognize and embody universal patterns. The relationship between individual and universal is neither mystical union nor mere obedience but harmonious alignment—like musical notes following a score to create symphony. Individual excellence in specific roles generates universal social harmony, as each thing finding its proper place creates cosmic order.

*** 1.20.115 Neo-Confucianism Response

Neo-Confucian thought, particularly as developed by Zhu Xi, understands individual things relating to universal principles through the li-qi framework. Li (principle/pattern) represents the universal, perfect, and unchanging pattern; qi (vital energy/matter) constitutes the particular, variable, and physical. Every individual thing is a unique condensation of qi structured by li. The relationship is simultaneous and inseparable—there is no li without qi to embody it, no qi without li to organize it.

Zhu Xi's famous metaphor of the moon illustrates this: universal li is like the moon in the sky, while individual things are like the moon's reflections in ten thousand waters. Each reflection is genuine, yet each is shaped by its particular circumstances (the clarity of water, size of vessel). The Great Ultimate (Taiji) exists completely in each individual thing, yet remains unified and transcendent. This is not pantheism but panentheistic holism—the universal permeates particulars without being exhausted by them.

The investigation of things (gewu) and extension of knowledge (zhizhi) provide the method for individuals to recognize universal principles. By thoroughly investigating the li of particular things—bamboo, filial piety, water—we gradually comprehend universal patterns. Wang Yangming's later development emphasized that li exists in the mind-heart (xin), making the individual mind the locus where universal principles are known and actualized. Whether following Zhu Xi's external investigation or Wang's internal cultivation, the goal remains the same: individuals realize their nature (xing), which is identical with universal li, thereby achieving unity of knowledge and action. Individual self-cultivation thus serves universal transformation.

*** 1.20.116 New Confucianism Response

New Confucianism, represented by thinkers like Xiong Shili, Mou Zongsan, and Tu Weiming, articulates the individual-universal relationship through dialogue with Western philosophy while recovering classical insights. The individual thing relates to universal principles through the creative transformation of tradition and the concept of "embodied universality." Unlike abstract universalism, New Confucians argue that universal principles only exist as embodied in particular cultural and individual forms.

Mou Zongsan's doctrine of "self-negating subjectivity" shows how individual consciousness contains within itself the capacity for universal moral knowledge. The individual mind can "ontologically realize" (zhengli) universal principles through moral practice, particularly through the Confucian virtues. This isn't merely knowing about universals but becoming them through self-transformation. The particular individual achieves universality not by transcending particularity but by fully developing moral subjectivity. Intellectual intuition (zhide zhijue) allows individuals direct access to universal moral reality.

Tu Weiming's concept of "the continuity of being" emphasizes that individual things participate in an organic universal process. Each person is a "center of relationships" whose particular actions have cosmic significance. The cultivation of humanity (ren) begins with embodied, particular existence—caring for parents, maintaining local traditions—but unfolds toward universal human flourishing. Individual self-cultivation (xiushen) is simultaneously universal transformation because the authentic self is always already connected to family, community, cosmos. New Confucians thus reject both atomistic individualism and totalizing universalism, proposing instead a "unity of particularity and universality" where individual things manifest universal principles through creative cultural participation and moral self-realization in concrete historical contexts.

*** 1.20.117 Daoism Response

In Daoist understanding, individual things relate to universal principles through spontaneous alignment with the Dao—the nameless, formless source and pattern of all existence. Each particular being naturally embodies the Way when not interfered with by artificial constructs. The relationship is one of effortless participation (wu wei)—individual things don't strive toward universality but express it through following their inherent nature (ziran).

The Daodejing teaches that the Dao gives birth to the One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to the ten thousand things. Each individual thing emerges from and remains connected to this universal source. Yet the Dao "accomplishes without acting" (wei wu wei), and individual things flourish when they similarly avoid forced action. The universal principle isn't a law imposed on particulars but the natural tendency of things to find balance and harmony. Like water flowing downward or trees growing toward light, individual beings manifest universal patterns through their particular natures.

Zhuangzi's teaching of "the equality of things" (qiwu lun) reveals that distinctions between individual and universal arise from limited human perspectives. From the Dao's viewpoint, particular and universal interpenetrate freely. The cook Ding carving an ox demonstrates this: through years of practice, his individual movements align perfectly with the universal pattern of the ox's structure. He doesn't apply external principles to particular situations but perceives and follows the natural lines already present. Individual things relate to universal principles not through subordination or participation but through spontaneous expression—each particular being is a unique manifestation of the Way, complete in itself yet connected to the totality.

*** 1.20.118 Philosophical Daoism Response

Philosophical Daoism, focusing on the classical texts and their metaphysical implications, understands individual things as temporary crystallizations of universal process. The relationship between particular beings and the Dao is one of continuous emergence and return. Each individual thing is a "node" in the vast network of transformations (hua) that constitutes reality. Universal principles don't govern individual things externally but operate as the internal logic of transformation itself.

The concept of "heaven and earth are not humane" (tian di bu ren) from the Daodejing indicates that the Dao doesn't privilege particular beings or impose anthropomorphic values. Individual things arise through the interplay of yin and yang, the fundamental polarities through which the Dao manifests. Each particular being contains both aspects in unique proportion, and its nature is defined by how these universal principles of complementarity express themselves. The sage recognizes this and practices wu wei—not forcing particular outcomes but allowing universal patterns to operate through individual situations.

Zhuangzi's butterfly dream illustrates the fluid relationship between individual identity and universal transformation. Am I Zhuangzi dreaming I'm a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I'm Zhuangzi? Individual existence is not a fixed substance but a perspective within universal process. The "pivot of the Dao" (dao shu) represents the point where one transcends attachment to particular perspectives and moves freely among them. Individual things relate to universal principles through radical contingency and ultimate interdependence—each particular is both fully itself and completely open to transformation into otherness. Philosophical Daoism thus presents a non-substantialist ontology where individual and universal are complementary aspects of single, dynamic reality.

*** 1.20.119 Religious Daoism Response

In Religious Daoism, individual things relate to universal principles through the transformation of qi (vital energy) and the cultivation of spiritual immortality. The Dao exists as supreme universal reality, while individual beings are temporary configurations of jing (essence), qi (energy), and shen (spirit). The relationship becomes one of alchemical transformation—individuals can refine their particular material existence to align with and eventually merge into universal, immortal reality.

The Three Pure Ones (Sanqing) represent the Dao's manifestation at different levels of universality and particularity. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning embodies the Dao in its most universal aspect, while subsequent emanations become increasingly particular. Each individual person is a microcosm containing the same structural principles as the macrocosm. The body's internal landscape mirrors the universal geography of sacred mountains, celestial bureaucracy, and cosmic forces. Through internal alchemy (neidan), practitioners transform the particular substances of their body—lead into gold, yin into yang—to achieve union with universal immortal principle.

The practices of visualization, breathing exercises, and ethical living allow individuals to accumulate merit (de) and refine their energy. The individual body becomes a vessel for universal cosmic forces. Deities are both external universal powers and internal particular energies—calling upon them cultivates their qualities within. The ultimate goal is individual immortality achieved through perfect alignment with universal Dao. This isn't metaphorical—Religious Daoism takes seriously the transformation of particular, mortal flesh into universal, immortal spirit-body. Individual things relate to universal principles through a graduated process of refinement, purification, and ultimate transcendence, yet this transcendence paradoxically requires deep engagement with the body's particular materiality.

*** 1.20.120 Shinto Response

In Shinto understanding, individual things relate to universal principles through the concept of kami—sacred power or essence that pervades all existence. Each particular being, place, or phenomenon can manifest kami, yet kami also represents the universal creative force animating reality. The relationship is one of sacred particularity—individual things don't merely represent universal principles but are themselves inherently sacred through their unique existence.

The concept of musubi (creative vitality) explains how universal life-force generates and sustains individual beings. Each thing emerges from the primordial creative activity of kami like Takami-musubi and Kami-musubi. Individual existence isn't separate from universal divine reality but is its direct expression. A particular mountain, river, or tree doesn't symbolize the sacred—it IS sacred through its unique presence. This is why Shinto practice focuses on specific places (each with its own kami) rather than abstract universal temples.

The notion of kannagara (following the way of the kami) indicates that individual things fulfill universal principles by authentically being themselves. Humans relate to this through practices of purification (misogi, harae) that remove impurities obscuring our connection to kami-nature. Rituals (matsuri) honor the kami present in particular locations and objects while simultaneously connecting participants to universal sacred reality. Each shrine venerates specific kami with local characteristics, yet all express aspects of the same universal divine creativity. Individual things relate to universal principles not through hierarchy or transcendence but through immediate sacred presence—the particular is holy in its particularity, and the universal manifests completely in each unique expression. Authenticity to one's specific nature is alignment with universal divine way.

*** 1.20.121 Japanese Shinto Response

Japanese Shinto understands the relationship between individual things and universal principles through the interconnected concepts of wa (harmony), kotodama (spirit of words), and the uniquely Japanese appreciation of mono no aware (the pathos of things). Each individual being participates in the sacred order not by conforming to external universal laws but by expressing its authentic particular nature within the harmonious whole. The kami-way reveals itself through the natural world's seasonal cycles and the specific landscape of the Japanese islands.

The imperial tradition, descending from Amaterasu Ōmikami, exemplifies this relationship. The emperor is both a particular individual and the embodiment of universal cosmic order linking heaven, earth, and humanity. Similarly, each Japanese person has both individual identity and participation in the collective kokutai (national essence). This isn't contradiction but the characteristic Shinto understanding that particular and universal interpenetrate. The universal principle doesn't exist abstractly but lives through specific mountains (Fuji, Tate, Haku), particular shrines (Ise, Izumo, Kasuga), and concrete practices adapted to local conditions.

Matsuri (festivals) demonstrate this relationship dynamically. Each local community celebrates festivals honoring specific kami in particular ways, yet all participate in universal patterns of purification, renewal, and gratitude. The carrying of mikoshi (portable shrines) brings kami into direct contact with the community, dissolving boundaries between sacred universal and profane particular. Individual sincerity (makoto) in practice matters more than doctrinal correctness because universal divine reality responds to authentic particular engagement. Japanese Shinto thus presents a thoroughly contextualized universality—the kami-way is simultaneously the specific way of this land, this people, and cosmic sacred principle applicable to all existence.

*** 1.20.122 Shinto-Buddhist Syncretism Response

In Shinto-Buddhist syncretism (shinbutsu shūgō), individual things relate to universal principles through the doctrine of honji suijaku—original essence and manifest traces. Buddhist deities represent universal enlightened principles (honji), while kami are their particular manifestations (suijaku) adapted to the Japanese context. This establishes a sophisticated relationship where individual local expressions reveal universal transcendent truth while maintaining their distinct authenticity.

The relationship works bidirectionally. From the Buddhist perspective, kami are provisional manifestations of buddhas and bodhisattvas, skillful means (upāya) for guiding beings toward universal enlightenment. From the Shinto perspective, Buddhist deities are foreign names for universal kami already present in Japan. Particular mountains become simultaneously the dwelling of specific kami and mandalas of universal Buddhist truth. Kūkai's teaching that the Japanese islands themselves constitute a sacred mandala exemplifies this—the particular geography is the universal dharmakāya's body.

Ryōbu Shinto developed elaborate correspondences: Amaterasu identified with Mahavairocana Buddha, both representing universal solar enlightenment manifesting through particular forms. Individual practitioners participate through practices combining Shinto purification with Buddhist meditation, shrine visits with sutra recitation. The individual thing (whether kami, buddha, or practitioner) exists at the intersection of particular cultural expression and universal salvific truth. This isn't confused mixing but sophisticated recognition that universal principles necessarily manifest through particular cultural forms, and particular traditions authentically express universal truth. Individual beings realize enlightenment not by abandoning their specific nature but by recognizing how universal Buddha-nature operates through their particular circumstances, whether practicing at a Shinto shrine or Buddhist temple—or both simultaneously.

*** 1.20.123 Analytical Philosophy Response

From the analytical philosophy perspective, the relationship between individual things and universal principles constitutes the problem of universals, approached through logical analysis and careful attention to language. Individual things (particulars or tokens) relate to universal principles (types, properties, or concepts) through various possible mechanisms that analytical philosophers have rigorously examined. The relationship is fundamentally a matter of logical structure and ontological commitment.

Realist positions, following Bertrand Russell and contemporary metaphysicians like David Armstrong, argue that universals exist independently as real entities that individual things instantiate. A particular red apple relates to the universal property REDNESS through an instantiation relation. This solves the problem of how different particulars can share genuine commonality but raises questions about the nature and location of these universal entities. Moderate realists propose that universals exist in re—in the things themselves—rather than in some Platonic realm.

Nominalist approaches, defended by Quine and others, deny that universals exist beyond language and concepts. Individual things are "red" not because they instantiate a universal REDNESS but because we apply the predicate "red" according to conventional rules. The universal principle is a linguistic or conceptual category, not an ontological reality. Trope theory offers a middle path: individual things possess particular property-instances (tropes), and universal principles emerge from similarity relations among these particular tropes. Contemporary analytical metaphysicians employ possible worlds semantics, set theory, and formal logic to analyze these relationships precisely. The question isn't answerable through intuition or tradition but requires rigorous conceptual analysis distinguishing different types of predication, examining quantifier logic, and clarifying what ontological commitments our best theories require. Individual-universal relations remain contested, demanding ongoing analytical investigation.

*** 1.20.124 Continental Philosophy Response

Continental philosophy approaches the relationship between individual things and universal principles by questioning the very distinction and examining the historical, cultural, and existential conditions that generate this dichotomy. Rather than seeking timeless logical structures, Continental thought investigates how individual-universal relations emerge through lived experience, historical development, and power dynamics. The relationship is neither fixed nor purely conceptual but constituted through concrete human existence.

Hegel's dialectical philosophy revolutionized this question by showing that universal principles develop through the historical unfolding of particular manifestations. The universal is not static essence imposed on individuals but the dynamic totality that includes all particular developments and contradictions. Individual things negate their immediate particularity to realize universal Spirit (Geist), which then returns to itself enriched by this particularity. The relationship is dialectical—neither individual nor universal exists independently but each constitutes itself through relation to its other.

Heidegger's fundamental ontology challenges the question itself by revealing that individual-universal categories reflect Western metaphysics' forgetting of Being. Dasein (human being-there) doesn't relate to universal principles as subject to object but exists as the site where Being discloses itself. Individual things aren't instances of universal categories but unique ways that Being presences. Foucault's genealogical approach exposes how supposedly universal principles function as historically specific power structures that discipline individual bodies and subjectivities. Deleuze's concept of "difference and repetition" reconceives universality not as identity but as differential repetition—individual things relate to virtual multiplicities rather than transcendent universals. Continental philosophy thus refuses neat solutions, instead revealing that individual-universal relations are historically contingent, existentially lived, politically contested, and fundamentally questionable.

*** 1.20.125 Existentialism Response

Existentialism radically reconceives the relationship between individual things and universal principles by asserting the priority of concrete individual existence over abstract universal essence. "Existence precedes essence," Sartre's famous dictum, means that individual human beings create their own nature through free choices rather than instantiating pre-existing universal principles. The relationship is one of creative self-determination rather than conformity or participation.

For Kierkegaard, the individual's relationship to universal principles generates anxiety and despair because ethical universals (social norms, moral laws) fail to address the existing individual's absolute relation to God. The "teleological suspension of the ethical" in Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac demonstrates that authentic individual existence sometimes requires transgressing universal principles. Universal religious truth must be appropriated through passionate individual commitment, through the "leap of faith" that cannot be mediated by universal reason. The individual's subjective truth matters more than objective universal principles.

Sartre's atheistic existentialism extends this: without God, there are no universal essences or moral principles preceding human existence. Individual consciousness is "condemned to be free"—we create values through our choices without universal guidelines to appeal to. Bad faith occurs when individuals pretend universal principles determine their actions, denying their radical freedom. Camus explores this through the Absurd—the confrontation between individual desire for meaning and the universe's silence regarding universal principles. Authentic existence requires creating individual meaning despite this absence. Even social existentialists like de Beauvoir acknowledge that while ethical principles emerge through collective human projects, these remain rooted in individual freedom and responsibility. Individual existence doesn't relate to pre-existing universal principles but generates values through authentic engagement with concrete situations, accepting the anguish of freedom.

*** 1.20.126 Phenomenology Response

Phenomenology investigates how individual things relate to universal principles by examining the structures of consciousness through which this relationship appears to us. Rather than assuming metaphysical positions about what exists independently, phenomenology describes how universality and particularity are constituted in experience itself. The relationship emerges through intentional consciousness directed toward phenomena.

Husserl's method of eidetic reduction reveals how consciousness grasps universal essences (eide) through individual instances. When we perceive a particular triangle, consciousness can perform an imaginative variation that grasps the universal essence TRIANGULARITY—what remains invariant across all possible triangular variations. Individual things serve as exemplars through which consciousness intuits universal structures. This isn't empirical generalization but categorial intuition—a distinct act where consciousness grasps a priori necessary structures. Universal principles exist as ideal meanings that individual acts of consciousness can repeatedly intend across different contexts.

Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception emphasizes that individual things relate to universal concepts through the lived body's pre-reflective engagement with the world. Before explicit conceptualization, our bodily being-in-the-world already organizes experience according to perceptual gestalts and motor intentionalities that exhibit universal structures. The universal "up-down" or "near-far" emerges from individual embodied existence, not as abstract categories but as lived spatial orientations. Heidegger's phenomenology shows that individual beings disclose themselves against backgrounds of significance shaped by universal existential structures—temporality, spatiality, being-with-others. Individual things relate to universal principles not through logical subsumption but through horizons of meaning constituted by intentional consciousness embedded in lived experience. The relationship is neither purely subjective nor objective but transcendental—belonging to consciousness's essential structure.

*** 1.20.127 Hermeneutics Response

Hermeneutic philosophy understands individual things relating to universal principles through the circular structure of interpretation. Individual texts, actions, or phenomena cannot be understood without reference to universal contexts (historical period, linguistic conventions, cultural traditions), yet these universals are themselves known only through engagement with particular instances. The relationship is the hermeneutic circle—neither purely particular nor universal but their continuous dialectical mediation.

Schleiermacher established that understanding any individual utterance requires grasping both its particular psychological context (the speaker's unique intention) and universal grammatical structure (language's general rules). Neither alone suffices—meaning emerges through their interaction. Dilthey extended this: individual historical events relate to universal patterns (Zeitgeist, cultural structures) that we reconstruct through interpretive understanding (Verstehen) rather than causal explanation. The relationship isn't subsumption of particular under universal law but recognizing meaningful connections.

Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics radically historicizes this relationship. Individual understanding always occurs within "horizons" shaped by tradition—universal prejudgments that enable and limit interpretation. Rather than obstacles to overcome, these prejudices are productive conditions for understanding. The fusion of horizons between interpreter and text creates new universal meanings through particular encounters. Ricoeur's hermeneutics of symbols shows how individual symbolic expressions (myths, rituals, texts) condense universal meanings that require interpretation to unfold. The relationship between individual and universal is mediated by language, history, and tradition—it's not given but achieved through interpretive dialogue. Individual things become intelligible by participating in universal traditions of meaning, which themselves only exist through continuous reinterpretation in particular contexts. Understanding is neither discovering pre-existing universal principles nor creating arbitrary individual meanings but negotiating between particularity and universality through interpretation.

*** 1.20.128 Structuralism Response

Structuralism reconceives the relationship between individual things and universal principles by arguing that underlying structures—not surface phenomena or conscious intentions—determine meaning and organization. Individual things (parole) relate to universal principles (langue) as specific instances relate to the systematic structure that generates and constrains them. The relationship is one of structural determination rather than participation or instantiation.

Saussure's linguistics established that individual speech acts derive meaning from their position within the universal system of language. No word means anything in isolation—meaning emerges from differential relations within the total structure. The individual sign "cat" means what it means not through reference to particular cats but through its difference from "bat," "mat," "car," etc. Universal linguistic structure (synchronic system) enables and constrains all particular utterances. Individual creativity occurs within systematic rules that exist independently of any speaker.

Lévi-Strauss applied this to culture: individual myths, kinship systems, and social practices manifest universal deep structures of the human mind. The enormous variety of particular marriage customs across cultures reflects a limited number of universal structural patterns—elementary structures of kinship based on exchange principles. Individual cultural forms are surface variations of universal structural oppositions (nature/culture, raw/cooked) that organize human thought. Althusser's structural Marxism argues that individual subjects relate to universal economic structures not through conscious awareness but through ideological interpellation—structures position individuals without their control. Barthes' semiology examines how individual cultural products (fashion, advertisements, foods) manifest universal codes and mythologies. Individual things relate to universal principles as generated effects of underlying systems—the structure is primary, individual instances secondary. The universal is the synchronic system of relations, the particular its diachronic manifestations.

*** 1.20.129 Post-Structuralism Response

Post-structuralism challenges structuralism's stable universal systems by revealing how individual things resist, exceed, and subvert universal principles. Rather than particular instances simply manifesting universal structures, individual events constantly destabilize, defer, and deconstruct supposed universals. The relationship is one of productive tension, différance, and perpetual displacement rather than ordered hierarchy.

Derrida's deconstruction demonstrates that universal concepts depend on individual differences they attempt to subordinate. The universal principle "presence" requires the supposedly derivative particular "absence" to be intelligible—yet this dependency undermines claims to priority. Individual textual events overflow universal meanings through dissemination, surplus, and trace. Every attempt to establish universal principles relies on metaphors, supplements, and exclusions that particular deconstructive readings expose. The relationship between individual and universal is undecidable—neither term successfully grounds the other.

Foucault's genealogy shows that supposedly universal truths (madness, sexuality, criminality) are historically specific formations emerging from particular power relations and discursive practices. Individual bodies don't instantiate universal norms but are disciplined, normalized, and constituted by power/knowledge networks. Resistance occurs through individual bodies' refusal of normalization. Deleuze and Guattari's concept of rhizomatic multiplicity rejects arborescent models where individuals branch from universal trunks. Instead, individual singularities connect in non-hierarchical networks without central organizing principles—multiplicities without unity. Lyotard's postmodern condition announces the end of universal metanarratives—only particular language games remain, incommensurable and irreducible to overarching principles. Individual things relate to supposed universals through strategic essentialism, tactical resistance, and creative deterritorialization. Post-structuralism reveals that claims to universality often mask particular interests and that individual differences productively disrupt systematic closure.

*** 1.20.130 Pragmatism Response

Pragmatism reconceives the relationship between individual things and universal principles by examining their practical consequences and functional roles rather than their metaphysical status. Universal principles are not eternal forms existing independently but conceptual tools that emerge from and are tested by individual concrete experiences. The relationship is instrumental—universals serve to organize, predict, and guide action regarding particulars.

Charles Peirce's pragmatic maxim states that a concept's meaning consists in its practical effects. Universal principles like "hardness" mean the sum of individual conditional predictions—if you scratch this, it will resist; if you drop it, it won't deform. Universals are habits of expectation derived from particular experiences and applicable to future instances. Individual things relate to universal principles through abductive inference—we hypothesize universal patterns to explain and predict individual observations, then test these hypotheses through further experience.

William James emphasizes that universal truths are those that work satisfactorily in organizing individual experiences. Truth isn't correspondence to abstract universals but successful guidance through particular situations. Individual experiences verify or falsify universal claims through their practical consequences. John Dewey's instrumentalism further develops this: universal principles (scientific laws, moral values) are tools for solving particular problems. They emerge from individual problematic situations requiring inquiry and are validated by their effectiveness in resolving those situations. The relationship is pragmatic—universals function to coordinate particular experiences, not to represent transcendent realities.

For pragmatists, asking whether universals "really exist" beyond their function is meaningless. Individual things relate to universal principles through ongoing experimental inquiry—we form general hypotheses based on particular cases, apply them to new instances, and revise them when individual experiences create anomalies. The relationship is dynamic, fallibilistic, and oriented toward practical consequences rather than metaphysical correspondence.

*** 1.20.131 Process Philosophy Response

Process philosophy, particularly as developed by Alfred North Whitehead, reconceives both individual things and universal principles as aspects of dynamic becoming rather than static being. Individual things are not substances persisting through time but actual occasions—momentary events of experience that arise and perish. Universal principles are not transcendent forms but eternal objects—pure potentials that individual actual occasions prehend and actualize in their process of becoming.

The relationship is neither participation nor instantiation but creative synthesis. Each individual actual occasion integrates universal eternal objects (qualities, patterns, relations) into its unique concrete satisfaction. A particular experience of blue doesn't instantiate an independent universal BLUENESS; rather, the eternal object "blue" becomes definite through its ingression into this specific occasion of experience. Universals without particular actualizations remain mere potentials; particulars without universal patterns would be unintelligible chaos. The relationship is mutual—eternal objects require actual occasions to gain concrete existence, while actual occasions require eternal objects to have determinate character.

Whitehead's Category of the Ultimate—that the many become one and are increased by one—describes how individual occasions synthesize multiple universal potentials into novel unities that then become data for future occasions. Universal principles operate as lures for feeling that guide individual occasions toward certain patterns of actualization, yet each occasion exercises creative freedom in how it integrates these potentials. God's primordial nature envisions all eternal objects in their pure potential universality, while God's consequent nature integrates all individual actualizations into comprehensive unity.

The relationship is organic and processive—neither individual nor universal exists independently but each requires the other in the creative advance into novelty. Individual things are drops of experience relating to universal principles as potentials actualized through concrete becoming.

*** 1.20.132 Thomism Response

In Thomistic philosophy following Thomas Aquinas, individual things relate to universal principles through the doctrine of moderate realism regarding universals and the distinction between essence and existence. Universal principles exist in three ways: ante rem (before the thing) in God's mind as divine ideas, in re (in the thing) as the common nature present in multiple individuals, and post rem (after the thing) in human intellects as abstracted concepts. Individual things participate in universal essences while possessing unique individual existence.

Each individual substance is a composite of form (universal principle) and matter (principle of individuation). The substantial form of "humanity" is universal—the same essential nature shared by all humans. Yet individual humans exist because this universal form is received in distinct portions of matter (materia signata quantitate). The universal principle doesn't exist as a separate Platonic Form but exists multiply in individual substances. The agent intellect abstracts universal concepts from particular sensory experiences through a process that grasps the intelligible form while leaving behind individualizing material conditions.

Individual things relate to universal divine principles through participation (participatio). God is absolute Being (Ipsum Esse Subsistens), while creatures participate in being to limited degrees according to their essences. Individual beings don't merely resemble God but genuinely share in His perfections in finite ways. The transcendental properties—being, unity, truth, goodness, beauty—are convertible universal principles that all individual beings manifest according to their mode of existence.

Natural law exemplifies this relationship ethically: universal moral principles derive from human nature's essential inclinations, yet individual practical judgments must apply these principles to particular circumstances through prudence. Individual things thus relate to universal principles through essence-existence composition, matter-form hylomorphism, intellectual abstraction, and participatory causality—a sophisticated metaphysical framework balancing realism about universals with recognition of genuine individuality.

*** 1.20.133 Scotism Response

In Scotist philosophy following Duns Scotus, individual things relate to universal principles through the doctrine of haecceity (thisness) and formal distinction. Against Thomistic emphasis on matter as the principle of individuation, Scotus argues that each individual possesses a unique haecceity—a positive individual form that makes it precisely this individual rather than another. The relationship between individual and universal is more complex than simple instantiation.

Universals exist through a formal distinction—less than a real distinction but more than merely mental. The common nature "humanity" has its own formal reality (natura communis) that is neither universal nor particular in itself. It becomes universal in the intellect through abstraction and becomes particular in reality through combination with individual haecceities. This common nature is really present in multiple individuals while remaining formally the same nature. Individual things thus relate to universal principles through sharing a formally identical common nature while possessing absolutely unique individuating principles.

Scotus's univocity of being asserts that being is predicated univocally—with exactly the same meaning—of God and creatures, substances and accidents, individuals and universals. This challenges the Thomistic analogy of being and establishes that individual things and universal principles participate in being in fundamentally the same way, though differing in their mode (infinite vs. finite, actual vs. potential). Universal principles don't exist on a metaphysically superior level but alongside particulars in the same conceptual space.

Regarding divine ideas, Scotus holds that God knows individual things through distinct divine ideas corresponding to each haecceity, not merely through knowledge of universal forms. Individual existence has intrinsic metaphysical importance equal to universality. The relationship between individual and universal in Scotist thought preserves robust individuality—each thing possesses irreducible thisness—while acknowledging genuine common natures that ground universal concepts and real similarities among individuals.

*** 1.20.134 Ockhamism Response

Ockhamist philosophy, following William of Ockham, radically reconceives the relationship between individual things and universal principles through its nominalist rejection of real universals. Only individual things exist extramentally—universals are names (nomina), concepts, or signs rather than ontological realities. Individual things don't relate to independently existing universal principles but to mental concepts and linguistic terms that group individuals based on similarities.

Ockham's razor—entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity—eliminates universal forms, essences, and common natures as unnecessary ontological commitments. We can explain similarity among individuals without positing shared universal entities. Multiple individual things are "horses" not because they instantiate the universal HORSENESS but because they resemble each other and we apply the universal term "horse" to all of them. The universal exists only as a concept in the mind (conceptus mentis) or a term in language (terminus) that signifies multiple individual things.

Individual things relate to universal principles through supposition theory—the various ways terms refer to reality. A universal term in personal supposition stands for individual things (as "horse" refers to this horse, that horse, etc.). The same term in simple supposition stands for the concept itself. But in neither case does the universal exist as a real entity beyond individual things and our mental acts. Ockham's theory of intuitive cognition emphasizes that we have direct cognitive access to individual existents—the primary objects of knowledge are particular things given in experience.

This nominalism has profound implications: universal principles in science are descriptive patterns we notice among individuals, not forces or entities causing individual behaviors. Moral universals are general terms for similar individual actions, not transcendent norms. Individual things don't participate in or instantiate universals—they simply exist, and we group them using universal concepts for practical and cognitive convenience. The relationship is linguistic and conceptual rather than metaphysical.

*** 1.20.135 Suarezian Scholasticism Response

Francisco Suárez's scholasticism offers a sophisticated synthesis addressing the relationship between individual things and universal principles through the doctrine of the formal concept and objective concept distinction, and through his unique metaphysics of being. Individual things relate to universal principles through a complex interplay of mental abstraction, real commonality, and metaphysical precision that attempts to navigate between extreme realism and nominalism.

Suárez distinguishes the formal concept (conceptus formalis)—the mental act of understanding—from the objective concept (conceptus objectivus)—the content or object represented by that act. Universal principles exist as objective concepts that have foundation in reality (fundamentum in re) through real similarities among individual things, yet they don't exist as separate universal entities. Individual substances possess real natures that genuinely resemble each other, providing the basis for universal concepts without requiring Platonic Forms or Thomistic common natures with independent reality.

Regarding individuation, Suárez rejects both matter (Aquinas) and haecceity (Scotus) as separate principles, arguing instead that individual substances are individual through their entire entity—existence and essence together constitute individuality. The individual thing relates to universal principles through its nature, which is conceptually distinguishable but really identical with its individuality. We can consider the universal aspect (the nature as shareable) and the individual aspect (this concrete existence) through rational distinction, but both are aspects of one reality.

Suárez's concept of being as a transcendental that abstracts from both infinite and finite, substance and accident, allows him to discuss how individual things participate in being while maintaining their uniqueness. Universal principles like being, unity, and truth apply to individuals not through real universal entities present in them but through conceptual precision about what is genuinely common despite real individuation. The relationship is neither pure realism nor pure nominalism but moderate realism grounded in real similarities without multiplying entities.
