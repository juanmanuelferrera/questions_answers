Karma Across Philosophical Traditions (50 words)

Karma manifests distinctly across philosophical traditions. Buddhist schools emphasize intentional action and dependent origination within cycles of rebirth. Hindu Vedanta traditions view karma as requiring divine administration by Ishvara. Jainism uniquely conceives karma as subtle material particles (pudgala) that physically adhere to souls through actions, requiring ascetic purification for liberation.
