*** 1.20.11 Lutheran Response

Individual things participate in universal principles through the dialectic of Law and Gospel, which structures all reality. Following Luther's theology of the two kingdoms, we understand that individual creatures exist within both the temporal realm (governed by natural law and reason) and the spiritual realm (governed by God's Word and grace). The universal principle is not an abstract form but the living Word of God, which addresses each individual thing in its particularity while simultaneously revealing God's eternal will.

The relationship between individual and universal manifests through what Luther called the "proper distinction" between hidden and revealed God (deus absconditus and deus revelatus). Individual things are masks (larvae Dei) through which God works, yet they retain their concrete particularity. A specific act of mercy, for instance, participates in the universal divine command to love neighbor, but this participation happens through faith working in love, not through metaphysical participation in an abstract principle.

Melanchthon's doctrine of the *loci communes* (common places) shows how universal theological principles organize particular biblical texts and life experiences. Yet, as the Formula of Concord emphasizes, individual believers are justified *sola fide* - each person stands alone before God, receiving Christ's universal righteousness as a completely external yet personally appropriated gift. The universal (Christ's righteousness) becomes truly individual without ceasing to be universal, and the individual becomes righteous without contributing anything from her particularity. This paradox - simul justus et peccator - reveals how individuals relate to universals through God's creative and redeeming Word, which speaks into existence what it names.

*** 1.20.12 Reformed/Calvinist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the sovereign decree of God, who ordains both the universal structures of reality and the particular existence of each thing according to His eternal purpose. Following Calvin's *Institutes*, we affirm that God's providence governs all things, both great and small, so that nothing happens by chance but everything unfolds according to the divine counsel. Universal principles - whether moral laws, natural regularities, or logical truths - are grounded in God's unchangeable nature and revealed will.

The doctrine of divine simplicity, articulated by Reformed scholastics like Francis Turretin, teaches that God's essence is identical with His attributes. This means universal principles are not separate from God but expressions of His single, indivisible being. Individual things participate in these principles through creaturely analogy: a just act reflects God's justice, a rational thought mirrors divine wisdom, but always as finite creatures participating in what is infinitely present in God. The covenant structure - particularly the covenant of works and covenant of grace - provides the framework through which individuals are related to universal moral principles.

Abraham Kuyper's sphere sovereignty shows how different domains of created reality (family, church, state, art, science) each operate according to universal principles appropriate to their sphere, yet each sphere contains irreducibly particular instances. The universal principle of justice, for example, applies differently in family life than in state governance, and each particular family embodies justice in unique ways while still answering to the universal norm. Through God's common grace, even fallen individuals and institutions can partially reflect universal principles, though perfect conformity comes only through Christ, in whom all things cohere and find their true relation to divine wisdom.

*** 1.20.13 Anglican Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the via media of sacramental realism, where the particular and universal interpenetrate without collapsing into either nominalism or extreme realism. Following Hooker's *Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity*, we recognize that universal principles exist in the eternal law of God, participate in human reason through natural law, and are revealed definitively in Scripture - yet these principles achieve concrete reality only through particular instantiations in church, sacrament, and Christian life.

The Anglican emphasis on incarnational theology, developed by F.D. Maurice and the Lux Mundi school, sees the Incarnation as the supreme instance of individual-universal relation: in Christ, full particularity (a specific human life in first-century Palestine) perfectly embodies the universal (the eternal Logos). This christological pattern extends throughout creation. Each individual thing, while genuinely particular and unrepeatable, also participates in universal structures that reflect the divine wisdom ordering all things toward their proper end in God.

The Book of Common Prayer's liturgical year demonstrates this relationship practically: universal themes (creation, fall, redemption, sanctification) are encountered through utterly particular moments - this specific Eucharist, on this Sunday, in this parish community. William Temple's sacramental philosophy argues that matter is capable of mediating spirit, so individual physical things can genuinely embody universal spiritual realities without ceasing to be themselves. The threefold sources of authority - Scripture, Tradition, and Reason - work together to discern how particular situations relate to universal principles, avoiding both legalistic rigidity and situational relativism. Through comprehensive synthesis rather than systematic reduction, Anglicanism maintains that individuals are related to universals through layered participation in God's ongoing creative and redemptive work.

*** 1.20.14 Methodist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the dynamic process of sanctification, wherein God's prevenient grace enables particular creatures to progressively conform to the universal holiness that is God's essential nature. Following John Wesley's doctrine of Christian perfection, we understand that while individuals begin in particularity marked by sin, they are called toward perfect love - a universal principle that must be actually realized in each unique person's life through the power of the Holy Spirit.

Wesley's practical divinity emphasizes that universal religious and moral truths are not merely contemplated but must be "inwardly experienced" and "outwardly practiced." The Wesleyan quadrilateral - Scripture, Tradition, Reason, and Experience - provides a fourfold method for discerning how universal principles apply to particular situations. Scripture contains universal revelation, Tradition preserves the universal witness of the church, Reason perceives universal logical and moral truths, and Experience is where these universals are personally appropriated by individual believers. The universal principle of love, for instance, is commanded in Scripture, exemplified in Christian tradition, commended by reason, and must become an experiential reality in each believer's heart.

The Methodist class meeting and system of mutual accountability shows how universal principles of holy living are worked out in specific communities. Each individual's sanctification journey is unique, yet all follow the universal pattern of justification, new birth, and growth in grace toward entire sanctification. Social holiness - Wesley's insistence that "there is no holiness but social holiness" - means individual salvation always occurs within the particular communities where universal love is practiced. General rules provide universal guidance, but they achieve their purpose only when particular persons apply them to concrete situations. Through means of grace (prayer, Scripture, sacraments, fellowship), individuals are progressively transformed to embody universal holiness in their irreducibly particular lives.

*** 1.20.15 Baptist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the direct, unmediated relationship between each soul and God, grounded in the competency of the individual under the universal lordship of Christ. Baptist ecclesiology, emerging from our Anabaptist heritage and developed by thinkers like John Smyth and Roger Williams, emphasizes that while universal principles exist in God's Word and nature, each individual believer has both the responsibility and the Spirit-given capacity to discern and apply these principles without requiring ecclesiastical intermediaries.

The principle of soul liberty means that each person stands individually before universal divine truth, accountable directly to God rather than to human authorities. This does not mean relativism - Baptists strongly affirm objective universal truths revealed in Scripture - but it means the relationship between individual conscience and universal principle is immediate and personal. The Baptist distinctive of believer's baptism illustrates this: the universal command to be baptized must be individually appropriated through personal faith and voluntary obedience. No one can fulfill this universal obligation on another's behalf; each person must personally embrace the universal gospel and submit to Christ's universal lordship.

The autonomy of the local church further demonstrates this pattern: each particular congregation, while bound to universal scriptural principles, governs itself under Christ's direct headship. Universal truths like religious liberty, biblical authority, and congregational governance are realized differently in each local body according to their Spirit-led discernment. E.Y. Mullins's concept of soul competency affirms that God has equipped each individual with capacity to relate personally to universal truth, while Walter Rauschenbusch's Social Gospel shows how individual conversion must lead to social transformation guided by universal principles of God's kingdom. Particular persons and communities embody universal principles not through hierarchical mediation but through direct, covenantal relationship with the one Lord who is sovereign over both individual and cosmos.

*** 1.20.16 Quaker Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the Inner Light, that of God in everyone, which illumines particular minds with universal truth while respecting the sacred uniqueness of each creature. Following George Fox's foundational insight that Christ teaches His people Himself, we understand that the universal Light shines in every individual consciousness, creating direct access to divine truth without necessary mediation through creed, clergy, or outward ceremony.

The Quaker testimony of continuing revelation means universal principles are not static abstractions but living truths that speak freshly to each particular situation through the movement of the Spirit. In silent worship, individuals wait in openness to the universal Light, which may guide the community through the particular voice of any Friend as the Spirit gives utterance. The sense of the meeting - our practice of corporate discernment - demonstrates how particular individuals collectively discern universal divine leading without voting or imposing majority will. Each person's individual perception is valued, yet we trust that faithful waiting will reveal the universal truth that transcends individual opinions.

Rufus Jones's mystical philosophy and Howard Brinton's interpretations show how the Inner Light doctrine avoids both extreme individualism and oppressive universalism. The Light is universal - it is the same Christ-light in everyone - yet it addresses each person in their unique particularity and historical situation. Our peace testimony illustrates this: the universal principle of answering that of God in every person leads to particular acts of pacifism, social justice, and reconciliation that vary with circumstances while remaining faithful to the universal truth. John Woolman's witness against slavery shows how an individual, led by the Inner Light, can perceive universal moral truth and call the community toward it. Particular things relate to universal principles through the Spirit's direct illumination, which respects both the objective reality of divine truth and the sacred integrity of individual conscience.

*** 1.20.17 Anabaptist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the concrete practice of discipleship in radical Christian community, where universal biblical commands are embodied in the particular, visible lives of believers who have voluntarily chosen to follow Christ's way. Following Menno Simons and the Schleitheim Confession, we understand that universal truth is not primarily conceptual but practical - it is found in the lived reality of costly obedience to Jesus's teachings, especially the Sermon on the Mount.

The Anabaptist emphasis on Nachfolge Christi (following Christ) means that individual believers relate to universal principles by actually doing what Jesus commanded, not merely assenting to doctrines about Him. The universal principle of enemy-love, for instance, is not a theoretical ideal but a concrete practice that each disciple must embody even unto martyrdom. The Martyrs Mirror testifies to countless individuals who, through their particular deaths, witnessed to the universal truth that Christ's kingdom operates by suffering love rather than coercive power. Each martyr's story is unique, yet all participate in the universal pattern of taking up the cross.

The believers' church concept shows how particular congregations, composed of voluntarily committed individuals, practice church discipline, mutual aid, and consensus decision-making as concrete embodiments of universal kingdom principles. John Howard Yoder's theology of the body of Christ emphasizes that universal ethical truth is found not in abstract principles accessible to autonomous reason but in the particular practices of the Christian community discerning together what faithfulness requires. The ban, foot-washing, the holy kiss - these particular practices embody universal principles of accountability, servanthood, and reconciliation. Individuals relate to universals not through hierarchical mediation or private mysticism but through communal discernment and shared practice. The universal (God's kingdom ethics) becomes real only as particular persons, in specific communities, actually live the nonconformed life that makes the church visible as an alternative society witnessing to Christ's lordship over all creation.

*** 1.20.18 Arminian Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the gracious prevenient work of God, who universally extends the capacity for response while respecting the particular free agency of each creature. Following Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrant tradition, we affirm that while universal principles of divine love, justice, and truth exist eternally in God's nature, their actualization in creation depends on the genuine free choices of particular individuals enabled by God's grace offered to all.

The doctrine of universal atonement grounds our understanding: Christ died for every individual person, meaning the universal principle of divine redemptive love genuinely applies to each particular human being without exception. This universal provision becomes individually effective through the particular free response of faith - a response made possible by prevenient grace that goes before, enlightening minds and freeing wills damaged by sin. Thus the relationship between individual and universal is neither necessitarian (universal principles automatically determining particular instances) nor voluntarist (individuals creating truth by arbitrary choice) but synergistic: God's universal gracious initiative meets the individual's particular response.

Hugo Grotius's governmental theory of atonement shows how universal justice and particular mercy are harmonized: God's universal moral government is maintained while individual sinners receive pardon through Christ's satisfaction. The Arminian understanding of conditional election and resistible grace means that each individual's eternal destiny is determined by how they relate to the universal offer of salvation, not by an unconditional decree that bypasses their particularity. Thomas Oden's recovery of classical Arminian theology emphasizes that universal principles of divine goodness and wisdom do not override but rather enable and empower genuine individual freedom. In this framework, particular things achieve their fullest reality not by being subsumed into universals but by freely conforming to universal truth through grace-enabled choice, maintaining both the objectivity of universal principles and the integrity of individual agency.

*** 1.20.19 Wesleyan Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the transformative work of sanctifying grace, which progressively conforms particular persons to the universal holiness that characterizes God's own nature while respecting and even perfecting their unique individuality. Following John Wesley's synthesis of Reformed and Catholic elements, we understand that universal principles exist primarily as aspects of God's character - love, holiness, justice, mercy - and secondarily as moral and natural laws governing creation.

Wesley's ordo salutis (order of salvation) describes how individuals progress in their relation to universal divine principles: prevenient grace universally restores the capacity to respond to God; justifying grace pardons the particular individual who believes; new birth initiates personal transformation; and sanctifying grace increasingly conforms the individual believer to the universal standard of perfect love. This is not a movement from particular to universal or vice versa, but a dynamic process where the individual becomes more truly themselves as they are conformed to Christ, who is both the universal Logos and a particular human person.

The Wesleyan emphasis on practical divinity means universal principles are not merely theoretical but must be worked out in the concrete particulars of daily life. Wesley's General Rules provide universal guidance for holy living, but their application requires prudential wisdom adapted to individual circumstances. The class meeting system created spaces where particular persons helped each other apply universal scriptural principles to specific life situations. Randy Maddox's scholarship on "responsible grace" shows how Wesley balanced universal divine sovereignty with individual human response: God's universal gracious work enables but does not override particular human agency. The universal principle of love must be individually experienced ("the witness of the Spirit"), personally practiced (works of mercy and piety), and socially expressed (reforming the nation, spreading scriptural holiness). Individuals relate to universals through a lifelong journey of transformation wherein grace perfects nature rather than destroying it.

*** 1.20.20 Pietist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the living experience of heart religion, where universal biblical truths become personally appropriated through spiritual rebirth and cultivated through devotional practice. Following Philipp Jakob Spener's *Pia Desideria* and August Hermann Francke's emphasis on the *Busskampf* (struggle of repentance) and *Durchbruch* (breakthrough to assurance), we understand that universal doctrinal truths remain merely external and ineffective until they are inwardly experienced and practically lived by individual believers.

The Pietist distinction between historical faith (notitia and assensus) and saving faith (fiducia) reveals our understanding of the individual-universal relationship. One may possess correct knowledge of universal Christian doctrines, yet remain unconverted if these truths have not penetrated the heart and transformed the life. The universal principle of justification by faith becomes salvifically real only when the individual experiences personal conviction of sin, cries out for mercy, and receives the assurance of God's forgiveness. Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian movement demonstrated this through intensive small group fellowship (*Gemeinschaft*) where universal biblical principles were applied to each person's spiritual condition through mutual confession, prayer, and accountability.

The collegia pietatis (small devotional gatherings) that Spener advocated were spaces where particular individuals helped each other move from dead orthodoxy to living faith. Universal scriptural truths were studied not merely for intellectual mastery but for spiritual transformation and practical obedience. Johann Arndt's *True Christianity* shows how universal mystical patterns (the *via purgativa*, *illuminativa*, and *unitiva*) are personally traversed by each believer through meditation, prayer, and holy living. The relationship between individual and universal is thus experiential and transformative: universal divine truth accomplishes its purpose when it becomes the particular believer's own life-giving reality, producing heartfelt love for Christ and active love for neighbor. Individual piety and social reform (Francke's orphanages, schools, and mission work) both flow from this personal appropriation of universal truth.

*** 1.20.21 Seventh-day Adventist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan, where each particular choice and event participates in the universal struggle between God's law and the rebellion against it. Following Ellen G. White's Great Controversy theme, we understand that universal principles - especially the unchanging moral law expressed in the Ten Commandments - provide the standard by which all individual actions and beings are measured and judged in both the investigative judgment and the final settling of the cosmic controversy.

The sanctuary doctrine reveals how individual cases are related to universal principles: in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ our High Priest mediates for individual believers while simultaneously upholding universal divine justice. The investigative judgment, which began in 1844, examines each individual's life in light of universal law, determining who has genuinely accepted Christ's righteousness and submitted to God's commandments. This is not arbitrary judgment but the careful application of universal principles to particular cases, witnessed by the universe so that all created beings may understand God's justice when the controversy finally ends.

The seventh-day Sabbath exemplifies the individual-universal relationship: it is a universal creation ordinance, a perpetual sign of God's creative and sanctifying power, yet it must be individually kept each week through concrete choices to cease from secular work and dedicate time to worship and fellowship. Our health message shows how universal principles of healthful living (the laws God built into human physiology) must be individually practiced through particular dietary and lifestyle choices. Our prophetic understanding that we live in the final generation before Christ's return means that each individual's choices have cosmic significance - each person who accepts or rejects the three angels' messages contributes to the universal demonstration of God's character before the watching universe. Individuals relate to universals through voluntary covenant loyalty to God's unchanging law, made possible by Christ's atoning sacrifice and enabled by the Holy Spirit's sanctifying power in these last days.

*** 1.20.22 Jehovah's Witnesses Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through Jehovah's theocratic order, wherein each particular creature finds its proper place and function within the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God, who rules through established principles revealed in His Word. Following the Watchtower Society's understanding of divine government, we recognize that universal principles are not abstract ideas but concrete expressions of Jehovah's will, which operates throughout creation according to his eternal purpose to vindicate his sovereignty and sanctify his name.

The issue of universal sovereignty raised by Satan's rebellion in Eden provides the framework for understanding all individual-universal relations: each individual's life and choices contribute to the resolution of this cosmic legal case. Will humans serve Jehovah voluntarily under his righteous principles, or will they pursue independent sovereignty as Satan claimed was better? Every particular act of obedience or disobedience by each individual Witness has significance in this universal controversy. The 144,000 anointed individuals who will reign with Christ in the heavenly kingdom demonstrate how particular persons can be selected for specific roles within Jehovah's universal purpose, while the great crowd of other sheep will live eternally on the paradise earth - another particular role within the universal restoration.

Theocratic organization shows how individuals relate to universal principles through headship arrangement: Jehovah exercises universal sovereignty through Christ, who directs the faithful and discreet slave (the Governing Body), who provide spiritual food to individual congregations, where each Witness submits to congregation elders, and families follow the headship of husbands and fathers. This hierarchical structure ensures that universal truth flows down through appointed channels to each individual. Disfellowshipping demonstrates the seriousness of this relationship: individuals who reject universal biblical principles must be removed to maintain the purity of the congregation. Through diligent study of the Bible as interpreted by the faithful slave, participation in theocratic activities, and door-to-door ministry proclaiming God's Kingdom, individual Witnesses align themselves with Jehovah's universal purposes, working toward the vindication of his sovereignty and the establishment of righteous principles throughout all creation.

*** 1.20.23 Latter-day Saint Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through eternal progression within the framework of intelligences, eternal laws, and the plan of salvation that enables each individual to advance toward exaltation. Following Joseph Smith's King Follett Discourse and subsequent revelation, we understand that certain principles are co-eternal with God himself - including individual intelligences (the eternal core of each person) and fundamental laws that even God honors. The relationship between individual and universal is thus neither creation ex nihilo nor Platonic participation, but progression through degrees of glory according to eternal laws.

The principle of eternal progression means that each individual intelligence is working toward becoming like our Heavenly Father, who is himself an exalted being. Universal principles such as faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost are not arbitrary divine commands but natural laws by which progression occurs - laws that God himself followed in his own advancement to Godhood. Temple ordinances reveal how individual salvation depends on particular ritual acts that connect persons to eternal covenantal relationships. Sealing ordinances bind individual family members into eternal units, showing that the highest universal principle is not abstract truth but concrete, loving relationships extending through generations.

Brigham Young's teaching that "truth is the relationship of things as they actually exist" reflects our epistemological realism: universal principles exist objectively in the eternal structure of reality, and individual progress depends on coming to know and live in harmony with these principles. The three degrees of glory (telestial, terrestrial, celestial) show how individuals are ultimately sorted according to the universal laws they were willing to obey and the light they received. Lorenzo Snow's famous couplet - "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be" - captures our distinctive understanding: the distinction between individual and universal, between particular person and divine principle, is not metaphysically absolute but represents different stages in eternal progression. Through ordinances, covenants, and righteous living, individuals align themselves with eternal laws, advancing toward exaltation where they themselves become creators and gods, having perfectly embodied universal principles in their own glorified, particular existence.

*** 1.20.24 Unitarian Universalist Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the free and responsible search for truth and meaning, which honors both the objective reality of universal values and the sacred worth of each individual's unique perspective and experience. Following William Ellery Channing's emphasis on the dignity of human nature and Theodore Parker's distinction between transient forms and permanent truths in religion, we understand that universal principles exist - love, justice, compassion, truth - but no single tradition or individual possesses complete or final understanding of these universals.

Our seven principles articulate universals that emerge from human experience across traditions: the inherent worth and dignity of every person, justice and compassion in human relations, acceptance of one another, the free search for truth, democratic process, the goal of world community with peace and justice, and respect for the interdependent web of existence. These principles are genuinely universal - they apply to all persons and situations - yet their application is mediated through the particular cultural, historical, and individual contexts in which people find themselves. The universal principle of inherent worth, for instance, leads different UU congregations and individuals to diverse expressions of social justice work, each shaped by local needs and personal callings.

James Luther Adams's concept of voluntary associations shows how particular communities form around shared commitment to universal values without requiring doctrinal uniformity. The individual conscience, informed by reason and experience, discerns how universal principles apply in specific situations. We draw wisdom from multiple sources - direct experience, prophetic voices, world religions, science, earth-centered traditions - recognizing that universal truth is refracted through many particular lenses. Unlike traditions claiming exclusive access to universal truth, we affirm religious pluralism: many paths lead toward the sacred, many formulations point toward universal values. Individuals relate to universals through ongoing dialogue, democratic process, and humble recognition that our particular understanding always remains provisional. The relationship is dynamic rather than fixed, characterized by growth, mutual learning, and increasing comprehension of universal truths that transcend while including all particular expressions.

*** 1.20.25 Christian Science Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the recognition that all true reality is Mind (God) and its ideas, while individual material things are erroneous mortal concepts that disappear as spiritual understanding advances. Following Mary Baker Eddy's *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures*, we understand that God, infinite divine Mind, is the only true universal, and individual things have reality only insofar as they are ideas in this infinite Mind. The relationship between particular and universal is not that finite things participate in separate universals, but that what appears as individual things are actually ideas eternally held in the one divine consciousness.

The fundamental universal principle is the allness of God: "All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation" (*Science and Health* 468:10). What mortal sense perceives as separate individual material objects are actually spiritual ideas that exist only in divine Mind. Mortal mind's testimony presents a false universal-particular relationship - material laws supposedly governing material objects - but this entire framework is what Eddy calls "animal magnetism" or mesmerism, a collective dream from which humanity must awaken. Healing occurs when individual consciousness discerns the true relationship: the problem is not a particular diseased body subject to universal physical laws, but a false belief that must be corrected through understanding God's universal perfection.

The seven synonyms for God - Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love - are universal aspects of the one divine reality. Individual demonstrations of Christian Science healing show these universals becoming manifest: a particular person's healing reveals the universal truth that Spirit is all, matter is nothing. Prayer in Christian Science is not petitioning a distant God but aligning individual consciousness with universal divine truth. Each person's spiritual progress consists in progressively understanding that their true individuality is an idea in divine Mind, not a material body subject to material laws. The relationship between individual and universal is thus one of recognition: as we understand God more clearly, we see that authentic individuality exists only as reflection of the infinite One, and all that seems separate, material, and mortal is gradually revealed as having no true existence. Universal Principle (God) and particular ideas (true individuals) constitute the only real relationship; matter and material laws are the negation to be overcome.

*** 1.20.26 Pentecostal Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the immediate, powerful presence of the Holy Spirit, who applies eternal truth to particular situations with fresh anointing and contemporary relevance. Following the Azusa Street Revival and the testimony of early pioneers like William J. Seymour and Aimee Semple McPherson, we understand that while universal biblical truths are established in Scripture, their full realization in individual lives and communities requires the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues and the ongoing operation of spiritual gifts.

The Pentecostal distinctives - salvation, Spirit baptism, divine healing, and Christ's second coming - are universal gospel truths, yet each must be personally experienced through direct encounter with God's power. The universal promise "you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you" (Acts 2) must become individually actualized through tarrying, yielding, and receiving. This is not merely intellectual assent to doctrine but experiential reality where the individual is overwhelmed by God's presence. Glossolalia (speaking in tongues) illustrates this perfectly: a universal spiritual phenomenon that manifests uniquely through each individual's vocal apparatus, producing utterly particular utterances that nevertheless participate in the universal language of the Spirit.

The nine gifts of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12) show how universal divine wisdom and power are distributed to particular individuals as the Spirit wills, for the edification of the whole body. A word of knowledge reveals specific information about a particular situation through direct divine revelation, not human reasoning. Healing services demonstrate how universal divine healing power is applied to individual sick persons through prayer and the laying on of hands. Our emphasis on immediate revelation means that universal biblical principles are not merely historical truths but living words that the Spirit makes real today in specific contexts. Donald Gee's teaching on Pentecostal balanced scholarship affirms that while we honor scriptural authority (universal revelation), we also depend on the Spirit's present-tense activity (particular application). Individuals relate to universals through Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts, which bring eternal truth into experiential, demonstrable reality with signs following.

*** 1.20.27 Charismatic Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the renewing work of the Holy Spirit, who transcends denominational boundaries to bring fresh expressions of ancient truth, empowering particular believers to manifest universal kingdom realities in diverse contexts. Following the Charismatic Renewal that swept through Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox traditions from the 1960s onward, we understand that universal spiritual truths are not locked in past traditions but are continuously made real through the Spirit's present activity in individual lives and communities.

The Charismatic movement demonstrates that the universal gifts of the Spirit (charismata) are not limited to Pentecostal denominations but are poured out on all flesh according to Joel's prophecy and Peter's Pentecost sermon. Each individual believer, regardless of theological tradition, can experience Spirit baptism, operate in spiritual gifts, and participate in signs and wonders. This universality-in-particularity appears in how Charismatic renewal has adapted to different traditions: Catholic Charismatics maintain sacramental theology while experiencing tongues and prophecy; Anglican Charismatics combine liturgical worship with Spirit-led spontaneity; Reformed Charismatics (like Martyn Lloyd-Jones influenced movements) integrate Word-centered theology with experiential pneumatology. The universal Spirit works through particular theological and cultural forms without erasing them.

Dennis Bennett's account of receiving Spirit baptism while serving as an Episcopal priest, and Cardinal Suenens's theological defense of Catholic Charismatic Renewal, show how the movement bridges traditional divides. The universal principles of God's love, power, and presence are encountered through particular gifts: an individual receives a specific prophetic word for a concrete situation, yet this manifests the universal reality that God speaks today. Praise and worship - especially through contemporary musical expressions - creates corporate experiences where individuals encounter universal divine presence together. Our emphasis on "every member ministry" means that universal priestly authority is distributed to all believers, who each exercise particular spiritual gifts. The "already but not yet" character of God's kingdom means universal principles (justice, healing, peace) are partially manifested through particular Spirit-empowered individuals and communities, pointing toward the ultimate full revelation when Christ returns and the Spirit's work reaches completion in all creation.

*** 1.20.28 African Independent Churches Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the holistic integration of spiritual power, communal identity, and ancestral wisdom, where the cosmic Christ encounters particular African realities and transforms them without destroying their authentic cultural identity. Following prophetic founders like Isaiah Shembe, Kimpa Vita, Simon Kimbangu, and contemporary theologians like John Mbiti and Kwame Bediako, we understand that universal Christian truth must incarnate within particular African worldviews, addressing the spiritual realities that shape daily life in our communities.

The universal principle of Christ's Lordship extends to all powers and principalities, including the spiritual forces that Western Christianity often ignores but which profoundly affect individual African lives. Healing, deliverance from evil spirits, and prophetic dreams are not peripheral superstitions but central realities where universal divine power meets particular human needs. Our worship - with drums, dance, and extended celebration - embodies the universal truth that God delights in joyful praise, expressed through our particular cultural forms rather than imported European patterns. The wearing of distinctive garments (white robes, sacred cords, ritual colors) by members shows how individual identity is formed through visible participation in the universal community of the redeemed.

The emphasis on charismatic leadership (prophets, apostles, messengers) shows how universal divine truth is mediated through particular individuals whom the Spirit anoints for our time and place. Unlike missionary Christianity that created dependence on foreign interpretation, AIC prophets hear directly from God for our context. The integration of healing, prophecy, and deliverance demonstrates our understanding that universal salvation addresses the whole person - body, spirit, family, community - not merely individual souls. Ubuntu theology ("I am because we are") reveals how individuals exist only in relationship to community and ancestors, so individual salvation is inseparable from communal restoration. Universal biblical principles like love, justice, and reconciliation are understood through African communal values and practiced in extended family structures. The particular struggles of African peoples - colonization, poverty, spiritual attack - are met by the universal power of the risen Christ who is not foreign but African, who speaks our languages, understands our worldview, and empowers us to resist both spiritual and political oppression.

*** 1.20.29 Liberation Theology Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the dialectical process of praxis, wherein particular oppressed peoples engage in concrete struggles for justice that both reveal and actualize universal liberation grounded in God's preferential option for the poor. Following Gustavo Gutiérrez's foundational work and the methodology developed by Jon Sobrino, Leonardo Boff, and others, we understand that universal truth is not timeless abstraction accessed through detached contemplation, but historical reality known through committed participation in the liberation of the oppressed.

The hermeneutical circle of liberation theology demonstrates our approach to the individual-universal relationship: we begin with particular experiences of poverty, exploitation, and marginalization; analyze these through social sciences to understand structural causes; reflect on them through biblical and theological lenses; and return to transformative action. Universal biblical principles like God's justice, the kingdom of God, and the exodus narrative become truly understood only when engaged from the standpoint of particular oppressed communities - peasant farmers in Latin America, indigenous peoples facing land theft, urban poor in favelas. The universal Christ is encountered concretely in the particular faces of suffering neighbors, as Matthew 25 reveals: "As you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me."

Paulo Freire's pedagogy of the oppressed shows how individual consciousness-raising (conscientização) is simultaneously discovery of universal structures of oppression and empowerment for collective action. Each person's experience of exploitation is both utterly particular and an instance of universal class struggle. Base ecclesial communities demonstrate this practically: small groups of particular poor persons gather to read Scripture, analyze their concrete situation, and organize for change - their particular struggles manifest the universal movement of God's Spirit liberating creation from bondage. The relationship between individual and universal is mediated through class analysis, praxis, and communal reflection. Universal salvation is not escape from history but transformation of oppressive historical structures; individual conversion is inseparable from social transformation. God's universal reign becomes real through particular acts of justice, each small victory over oppression anticipating the full liberation of all creation.

*** 1.20.30 Black Theology Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the particular historical experience of Black suffering and resistance, which both reveals universal truth about God's liberating nature and challenges false universals that mask white supremacy. Following James Cone's revolutionary work and expanded by Delores Williams, Katie Cannon, and others, we understand that authentic universal theology must emerge from particular Black experience rather than pretending to neutral, ahistorical abstraction that inevitably privileges white European perspectives.

The cross of Christ takes on universal meaning only when understood through particular Black suffering: the lynching tree, as Cone argues, reveals what the cross truly means - God in solidarity with the lynched, murdered, and despised. This is not reducing universal truth to particular experience, but recognizing that universal claims divorced from particular suffering of the oppressed are ideological deceptions. The universal claim that "all lives matter" obscures the particular reality that Black lives are systematically devalued; true universal value must emerge through particular affirmation: "Black lives matter." God's universal love is revealed precisely in God's particular solidarity with Black people and all oppressed groups.

The spirituals and Black church worship show how particular cultural expressions contain profound universal theological truths: the exodus narrative, the suffering servant, the God who makes a way out of no way. Each individual's Blackness is not incidental but central to their relationship with God, who is revealed in Scripture as liberator of the oppressed. Yet this particular revelation also illuminates universal truth: God is on the side of all oppressed peoples. Womanist theology (Alice Walker, Delores Williams, Emilie Townes) further specifies how Black women's experience reveals that universal liberation must address interlocking oppressions of race, gender, and class. The relationship between individual and universal is thus neither pure particularity (racial separatism) nor false universalism (colorblind theology), but recognition that universal truth about God's justice emerges through God's particular actions in Black history - slavery, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, ongoing resistance. Each individual Black person's struggle relates to universal human dignity precisely by refusing to abstract from their particular racial reality, knowing that God sees, values, and liberates Black people specifically as part of God's universal liberating work.

*** 1.20.31 Feminist Theology Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the critique of patriarchal false universals and the recovery of diverse particular experiences - especially women's experiences - as valid sources of theological truth that reveal a more authentic understanding of universal divine reality. Following pioneers like Rosemary Radford Ruether, Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, and Sallie McFague, we recognize that what has been presented as universal Christian theology is actually the particular perspective of privileged men, falsely universalized and imposed as normative.

The feminist hermeneutics of suspicion examines supposedly universal theological principles and reveals their patriarchal construction: the maleness of God-language is not universal truth but particular cultural projection; subordination of women is not universal divine order but sinful distortion; gender complementarity is not creation ordinance but ideology justifying oppression. True universal principles emerge when we listen to the particular voices of women across cultures, classes, and historical periods, discovering patterns of experience that patriarchal theology suppressed. The universal imago Dei includes full female personhood; universal salvation liberates women from sexist oppression, not only from individual sin.

The use of diverse female images for God (Sophia, Mother, Midwife, Baker Woman) is not merely adding particular examples to an essentially male universal, but recognizing that no gendered language captures God's fullness - yet our particular language choices have political and spiritual consequences. Ecofeminist theology (Ivone Gebara, Rosemary Radford Ruether) shows how the domination of women and domination of nature stem from the same logic of patriarchal dualism that falsely separates spirit from matter, universal from particular, male from female. Mujerista theology (Ada María Isasi-Díaz) and womanist theology demonstrate that white feminist claims to universality can themselves suppress particular experiences of women of color. The relationship between individual and universal is thus irreducibly complex: each woman's particular experience matters and must be heard; patterns across women's experiences reveal truths suppressed by patriarchy; but no single perspective can claim universal truth. Through consciousness-raising groups, women's liturgies, and collaborative theology, we collectively construct more adequate understanding of universal divine reality by taking particular women's experiences seriously as theological sources, not merely applying predetermined universal principles to women's lives.

*** 1.20.32 Process Theology Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the dynamic process of creative synthesis, wherein each actual occasion prehends eternal objects and prior actualities, producing novel unity that contributes to the ongoing evolution of God's consequent nature. Following Alfred North Whitehead's metaphysics and its theological application by Charles Hartshorne, John Cobb, and David Ray Griffin, we reject the classical substance ontology that sees individuals as instantiations of static universals, replacing it with a process ontology where both particulars and universals are elements in the creative advance.

Eternal objects (Whitehead's revised Platonic forms) are universal potentials that ingress into particular actual occasions through the process of concrescence. A specific act of kindness, for instance, prehends the eternal object of kindness (a universal potential), but combines it with the unique perspective of that particular occasion, its inheritance from past occasions, and its subjective aim toward novelty. The universal (eternal object) and the particular (actual occasion) are neither separate nor simply identical - they are co-constitutive in each moment of becoming. God's primordial nature contains all eternal objects as pure potentials (universals), while God's consequent nature receives and integrates all actual occasions (particulars) into the divine experience.

The principle of creative synthesis means that each individual occasion has genuine freedom to decide how it will integrate universal possibilities with inherited actualities. This is neither pure determinism (universals fully determining particulars) nor pure voluntarism (particulars creating truth arbitrarily), but a middle way where both constraint and novelty are real. Catherine Keller's postmodern process theology and Jay McDaniel's ecological applications show how this framework enables genuine pluralism: different particular occasions can actualize universal potentials in diverse ways, each contributing unique value to the cosmic process. Individuals relate to universals through creative self-determination that both honors universal possibilities and adds irreducible novelty. God persuades rather than coerces, offering optimal possibilities (universals) while respecting the self-creative freedom of each occasion (particular). The universe is thus an ongoing adventure of ideas becoming concrete, and concrete occasions contributing to the divine life, in a process that transcends the static individual-universal dichotomy.

*** 1.20.33 Neo-Orthodox Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the event of divine revelation, wherein the transcendent God addresses particular human beings in their concrete historical situations with the universal Word that is Jesus Christ. Following Karl Barth's Romans commentary and Church Dogmatics, along with Emil Brunner and Reinhold Niebuhr, we reject both rationalist universalism (which claims natural access to universal truth) and romantic individualism (which reduces truth to subjective experience), insisting that true relationship between particular and universal occurs only through God's self-revelation.

The infinite qualitative distinction between God and humanity means that universal divine truth cannot be reached by human reason ascending from particular experiences to general principles, nor by mystical contemplation transcending particularity. Rather, God descends to meet us - the universal Word becomes particular flesh in Jesus Christ. This christological concentration reveals the pattern for all individual-universal relations: genuine universality is always encountered in irreducible particularity, and authentic particularity is always addressed by universal truth. The individual human being, in their absolute particularity before God, hears the divine "Thou shalt" and "Thou mayest" which is simultaneously completely universal (the same command to all) and utterly personal (addressed to this person in this moment).

Barth's doctrine of election shows that universal truth (God's decision for humanity in Christ) is the basis for individual identity (each person's particularity is established by being included in Christ). Brunner's "divine-human encounter" emphasizes that revelation is not information about universal truths but personal address creating relationship between the universal God and particular persons. Niebuhr's Christian realism applies this to politics: universal principles like justice and love cannot be directly implemented by finite, sinful humans, yet they stand as transcendent judgment on all particular political arrangements while also inspiring approximations of justice in concrete situations. The relationship between individual and universal is thus neither rational coherence nor mystical identity, but dialectical encounter - the crisis in which God's universal Word shatters human self-sufficiency and recreates the individual through judgment and grace. Each person stands alone before God, yet all stand under the same Word who is both universal Logos and particular Jesus of Nazareth.

*** 1.20.34 Radical Orthodox Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through analogical participation in the Triune God, who is the infinite fullness transcending and grounding all particular-universal relations while being known through the incarnate particularity of Christ and the traditions of the church. Following John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, we reject both secular reason's autonomous universals and postmodern nominalism's dissolution of truth, instead recovering a theological ontology where participation (methexis) bridges particular and universal through the divine gift of being.

The doctrine of analogy of being (analogia entis), properly understood not as natural theology but as the structure of created participation in divine being, shows how particular created things genuinely reflect universal divine attributes without either identity (pantheism) or total equivocation (agnosticism). A particular act of love is truly love, participating in the universal divine Love, yet infinitely distant from God's love - this analogical relationship is possible only because God creates through the Logos, who orders all things according to divine wisdom. The secular attempt to establish autonomous universal reason (the Enlightenment project) and its postmodern unraveling both fail because they deny this participatory ontology.

The Eucharist exemplifies radical orthodox understanding of individual-universal relations: this particular bread becomes (through transubstantiation or a more sophisticated metaphysics of transformation) the Body of Christ, which is both the singular historical body of Jesus and the universal body of the church. The particular and universal interpenetrate through liturgical performance that re-presents (makes present again) Christ's sacrifice. Against modern reductionism, we affirm that particulars are more real, not less real, when understood as participating in universals grounded in God. Milbank's critique of secular ontologies as inherently violent contrasts with the Christian ontology of peace, where difference (particularity) is not opposed to harmony (universality) but constitutive of the divine life itself - the Trinity is eternal difference-in-relation. Particular things relate to universal principles through the church's liturgical, sacramental, and narrative practices, which configure particulars according to the universal pattern revealed in Scripture and Tradition, resisting modernity's false choice between abstract universal reason and fragmented particular experiences by recovering the beautiful complexity of theological participation in the God who is both utterly particular (incarnate) and absolutely universal (transcendent).

*** 1.20.35 Catholic Worker Movement Response

Individual things relate to universal principles through the personalist revolution of voluntary poverty, direct action, and works of mercy, wherein each particular person takes personal responsibility for embodying universal kingdom values in the concrete realities of serving the poor and resisting injustice. Following Peter Maurin's Easy Essays and Dorothy Day's lived witness, we understand that universal Christian principles - love of enemy, preference for the poor, corporal and spiritual works of mercy, rejection of violence - must be individually practiced through radical personal commitment, not delegated to institutions or reduced to political abstractions.

The Catholic Worker houses of hospitality demonstrate this relationship: each house is utterly particular, responding to local needs with voluntary staff serving specific homeless persons, yet all participate in the universal pattern established by Christ's identification with the least. We don't serve "the poor" as an abstract universal class, but rather serve this particular hungry person who comes to our door today. Yet this particular act of feeding one person participates in the universal truth that Christ is present in the hungry, and challenges the universal structures of capitalism and militarism that create poverty. Dorothy Day's insistence on seeing Christ in the "ambassadors of God" - even the drunk, the mentally ill, the ungrateful - shows how each particular difficult person is a locus of universal divine presence.

The integration of personalism (Emmanuel Mounier's philosophy emphasizing the irreducible dignity of each person) with distributism (Chesterton and Belloc's economic vision) and pacifism creates a praxis where individuals relate to universal principles not through abstract adherence but through daily choices: voluntary poverty instead of careerism, hospitality instead of property, nonviolent resistance instead of collaboration with war-making. Peter Maurin's vision of "building a new society within the shell of the old" means that particular Catholic Worker communities are not merely ameliorating suffering within existing structures, but living out universal kingdom principles that prefigure the transformed world. Each individual's vocation is to become a "personalist" - a person who takes personal responsibility for living the gospel universally demanded of all Christians but practiced by too few. The relationship between particular and universal is immediate and practical: the universal call to holiness is answered through particular acts of mercy, each loaf of bread shared manifesting the universal truth that God's kingdom belongs to the poor, each arrest for peace witness testifying that Christ's universal lordship judges all earthly powers.
