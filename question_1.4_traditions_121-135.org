*** 1.4.121 Korean Buddhism Response

Korean Buddhism articulates causation through the synthesis of pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination) with indigenous Korean metaphysical concepts, particularly as developed through the Hwaeom (Huayan) and Seon (Chan) traditions. Causation is understood as the simultaneous interpenetration of all phenomena within the dharmadhātu, where each entity both conditions and is conditioned by all others in a non-linear, holistic network.

Historically, Wonhyo (617-686 CE) revolutionized Korean Buddhist causality through his concept of hwajaeng (reconciliation of doctrinal controversy), arguing that apparent contradictions in causal explanations arise from different perspectives on the same interdependent reality. His "Exposition of the Vajrasamādhi Sūtra" demonstrates how causation operates simultaneously at conventional and ultimate levels. Uisang (625-702 CE) developed the "Ocean Seal Samādhi" diagram illustrating the instantaneous mutual causation of all dharmas within Indra's net. Jinul (1158-1210 CE) integrated sudden enlightenment with gradual cultivation, proposing that karmic causation operates differently before and after awakening, with causes producing effects in deluded consciousness but dissolving in enlightened awareness.

The Avatamsaka Sūtra serves as the foundational text, particularly its teaching of "interpenetration without obstruction" (sa-sa-mu-ae). The Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment, highly influential in Korean Buddhism, describes causation as circular rather than linear, where effects return to modify their causes. Korean Buddhism emphasizes three argumentative pillars: first, the doctrine of simsi (true-mind) posits an unconditioned ground that allows conditional causation to function without infinite regress; second, the principle of yuil-sasang (all dharmas return to One) resolves the multiplicity of causal chains into singular Thusness; third, the concept of dolbal-simwon (sudden awakening, sudden cultivation) challenges gradualist causation.

Internal variations include the Jogye Order's emphasis on hwadu practice that transcends causation, versus the Taego Order's tantric view of causation as energy transformation through ritual. The Wonbulgyo (Won Buddhism) movement, founded by Sotaesan (1891-1943), modernized causation as "karmic retribution" functioning like natural law, making Buddhism compatible with scientific causality.

Critics question whether denying substantial causation undermines moral responsibility. Korean Buddhism responds that conventional causation operates validly for unenlightened beings, while ultimate non-causation describes the enlightened perspective. Contemporary applications include ecological philosophy, where interdependent causation grounds environmental ethics, and therapeutic Buddhism addressing trauma through recontextualizing causal narratives. Compared to Chinese Buddhism, Korean Buddhism emphasizes practical synthesis over systematic analysis, while sharing Zen's emphasis on transcending causal thinking altogether.

*** 1.4.122 Vietnamese Buddhism Response

Vietnamese Buddhism understands causation through the integrated framework of Mahāyāna dependent origination, Thiền (Zen) immediacy, and indigenous Vietnamese cosmology emphasizing harmony between human action and cosmic patterns. Causation operates through nghiệp-báo (karmic retribution) while simultaneously being empty of inherent existence, creating a paradoxical middle way between determinism and libertarian freedom.

The Lý Dynasty (1009-1225 CE) established Vietnamese Buddhist causality's distinctive character. Monk Khuông Việt (933-1011 CE) synthesized Indian Buddhist causality with Confucian moral causation and Taoist natural spontaneity. The "Thiền Uyển Tập Anh" (Outstanding Figures of the Zen Garden), compiled around 1337 CE, documents Vietnamese masters' teachings on causation as simultaneously immediate and karmic. Emperor Trần Nhân Tông (1258-1308), who abdicated to become Monk Hương Vân, taught that causation functions within saṃsāra but dissolves in awakened awareness—his "Thiền Tông Chỉ Nam" articulates this dual-aspect causality. Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926-2022) revolutionized Vietnamese Buddhist causality for global audiences through "interbeing," where causes and effects mutually contain each other in continuous co-arising.

The Lotus Sūtra and Vimalakīrti Sūtra provide scriptural foundations, emphasizing non-dual causation. Vietnamese Buddhism particularly values the Śūraṅgama Sūtra's teaching that causal chains arise from fundamental ignorance but lack ultimate reality. The "Song of the Practice of the Way" by Master Vô Ngôn Thông (1031-1100) describes causation as "neither coming nor going, yet manifesting all things."

Three core arguments structure Vietnamese Buddhist causality: First, nhân-duyên (cause-and-condition) operates through complex matrices where no single cause produces an effect—only converging conditions. Second, tam-thời (three times) causality explains how past karma, present conditions, and future potentials simultaneously determine events. Third, vô-tâm (no-mind) causation describes spontaneous arising without deliberate intention, particularly in enlightened action.

Internal variations include Northern Vietnamese Trúc Lâm tradition's emphasis on sudden causation-transcendence versus Southern Pure Land schools' stress on linear karmic causation across rebirths. The Hòa Hảo Buddhist reform movement emphasizes simplified causality accessible to laypeople.

Critics argue this framework creates inconsistency between karmic law and emptiness. Vietnamese Buddhism responds through the "two truths" doctrine: causation is conventionally real, ultimately empty. Contemporary applications include Engaged Buddhism, where understanding causation grounds social activism, and reconciliation practices addressing Vietnam War trauma through karmic recontextualization. Compared to Thai Theravāda, Vietnamese Buddhism emphasizes non-dual causation, while sharing Chinese Buddhism's scholarly systematization balanced with meditation practice.

*** 1.4.123 Chinese Buddhism Response

Chinese Buddhism conceptualizes causation through the synthesis of Indian Buddhist pratītyasamutpāda with Chinese correlative cosmology, generating distinctive theories of yinyuan (cause-and-condition) that integrate karmic retribution with Daoist spontaneity and Confucian moral causation. Causation operates through complex networks of li (principle) and shi (phenomena), where universal patterns instantiate in particular events while particular events simultaneously manifest universal principles.

The translation movement beginning in the 2nd century CE transformed Indian causal vocabulary into Chinese philosophical categories. Kumārajīva (344-413 CE) translated Nāgārjuna's works, introducing emptiness as the ground of causation—his "Middle Treatise" commentary argues that causation functions precisely because phenomena lack intrinsic nature. Zhiyi (538-597 CE), founder of Tiantai, developed "three thousand realms in a single thought-moment," proposing that each mental instant contains all possible causal domains interpenetrating simultaneously. Fazang (643-712 CE) articulated Huayan causality through the metaphor of Indra's net, where each jewel reflects all others, demonstrating that every cause is simultaneously an effect and every effect simultaneously a cause. Xuanzang (602-664 CE) introduced Yogācāra seed causation (bīja), explaining how subliminal karmic impressions generate manifest reality.

The Avatamsaka Sūtra grounds Huayan theories of universal causation, while the Lotus Sūtra emphasizes single-vehicle causality where all paths lead to Buddhahood. The Heart Sūtra's negation "no origination, no cessation" challenges substantial causation. The Platform Sūtra attributes sudden enlightenment causality to Huineng, contrasting with gradual cultivation causality.

Four philosophical arguments structure Chinese Buddhist causality: First, emptiness enables causation—things interact precisely because they lack fixed essence. Second, storehouse consciousness (ālayavijñāna) preserves causal continuity across moments and lifetimes without requiring a permanent self. Third, the two truths doctrine resolves causation's paradoxes—conventionally real, ultimately empty. Fourth, original enlightenment (benjue) theory proposes uncaused Buddha-nature as the ground enabling conditioned arising.

Internal variations include Chan's emphasis on transcending causation through direct insight versus Pure Land's linear causality where present faith causes future rebirth. Consciousness-Only school emphasizes idealist causation—external objects arise from internal seeds. Sanlun (Madhyamaka) school stresses causation's ultimate unreality.

Critics question whether denying substantial causation undermines moral responsibility and logical coherence. Chinese Buddhism responds that conventional causation operates validly within saṃsāra, while awakened beings recognize its constructed nature. Contemporary applications include Humanistic Buddhism's social engagement grounded in interdependent causation, and Chinese medicine's integration of karmic with physical causality. Compared to Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese traditions emphasize philosophical subtlety over systematic classification, while sharing Mahāyāna's core commitment to emptiness-based causation. The synthesis with Confucian ethics produced distinctive moral causation theories emphasizing family karma and social responsibility.

*** 1.4.124 Japanese Zen Response

Japanese Zen Buddhism articulates causation through the radical doctrine of mujō-seppō (impermanence preaches the dharma), where causation itself is understood as a conceptual construct that obscures direct reality. Authentic causation operates through mu (nothingness) and kū (emptiness), transcending linear cause-effect relationships in favor of simultaneous, spontaneous arising within Buddha-nature.

Eisai (1141-1215 CE) introduced Rinzai Zen to Japan, teaching that causation must be transcended through kōan practice that short-circuits rational causal thinking. His "Kōzen Gokoku Ron" argues that understanding causation intellectually perpetuates delusion, while direct insight reveals causation's emptiness. Dōgen (1200-1253 CE) revolutionized Zen causality through his doctrine of uji (being-time), where cause and effect occupy the same temporal moment—his "Shōbōgenzō" states "firewood does not become ash" because each moment is complete, transcending sequential causation. Bankei (1622-1693) taught the "Unborn" as uncaused Buddha-nature, arguing that seeking causes perpetuates ignorance. Hakuin (1686-1768) systematized kōan training to destroy causal reasoning, particularly through the mu kōan that negates all causation.

The Platform Sūtra's sudden enlightenment teaching provides foundational authority, emphasizing immediate awakening beyond gradual causal cultivation. The Lankāvatāra Sūtra's teaching that external objects don't cause perceptions but arise from mind-only supports Zen's rejection of external causation. Dōgen frequently cited the "Dharma Flower Turning Dharma Flower Sūtra" passage demonstrating non-dual causation.

Three core arguments structure Zen causality: First, hishiryō (non-thinking) reveals reality beyond causal categories—meditation doesn't cause enlightenment but manifests inherent Buddha-nature. Second, the doctrine of hongaku (original enlightenment) posits uncaused awakening as fundamental reality, with apparent causation arising from delusion. Third, ji-ji-mu-ge (mutual non-obstruction of phenomena) describes instantaneous interpenetration where causes and effects co-arise without temporal sequence.

Internal variations include Rinzai's emphasis on kōan practice that violently disrupts causal thinking versus Sōtō's shikantaza (just sitting) where causeless sitting is itself enlightenment. The Ōbaku school integrates Pure Land linear causation with Zen immediacy. Lay Zen movements emphasize everyday causation as Buddha-activity.

Critics argue this framework creates moral nihilism and contradicts karma doctrine. Zen responds that conventional causation governs unenlightened life, while awakening reveals causation's constructed nature—"before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water; after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water," but with transformed understanding. Contemporary applications include Zen-influenced psychotherapy that releases clients from causal narratives binding them to past trauma, and ecological philosophy grounding environmental ethics in interdependent arising. Zen arts (tea ceremony, calligraphy, martial arts) embody causeless spontaneity. Compared to Pure Land Buddhism, Zen radically emphasizes transcending causation, while sharing Chinese Buddhism's philosophical sophistication and meditation-centered practice that prioritizes direct experience over conceptual understanding of causal mechanisms.

*** 1.4.125 Korean Seon Response

Korean Seon Buddhism articulates causation through the distinctive synthesis of hwadu meditation, which transcends causal reasoning, with the philosophical framework of "original enlightenment" (bongak) that grounds conventional causation in unconditioned Buddha-nature. Causation operates through the simultaneous truth of karmic conditioning and the emptiness of all causal relationships, requiring practitioner engagement with both dimensions.

Jinul (1158-1210 CE) established Korean Seon's characteristic approach to causation through his doctrine of "sudden awakening followed by gradual cultivation" (dono-jeomsu). His "Secrets on Cultivating the Mind" argues that initial awakening reveals causation's emptiness, but karmic habits require gradual causal purification. Taego Bou (1301-1382) integrated ganhwa Seon (hwadu meditation) with doctrinal study, teaching that causation functions differently in deluded and awakened consciousness—the awakened mind engages causation without being bound by it. Gyeongheo (1846-1912) revitalized Korean Seon by emphasizing radical doubt that dissolves causal thinking, teaching that genuine causation operates through "great question" rather than logical inference. Seongcheol (1912-1993) controversially argued for "sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation," claiming that true awakening instantly purifies all karmic causation without gradual process.

The Platform Sūtra provides foundational authority for sudden awakening beyond causal cultivation. The Avatamsaka Sūtra's teaching of simultaneous interpenetration grounds Korean Seon's holistic causality. The "Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment," particularly influential in Korean Buddhism, describes causation as circular—effects modify causes in continuous feedback. Dahui Zonggao's letters on kōan practice, highly valued in Korean Seon, emphasize breaking through causal reasoning.

Four core arguments structure Korean Seon causality: First, hwadu practice generates "great doubt" that transcends causal thinking, revealing direct reality. Second, the doctrine of tathāgatagarbha (여래장) posits unconditioned Buddha-nature as the ground enabling conditioned causation without itself being caused. Third, "one mind opens two gates" (ilsim-imon) explains how single Buddha-nature manifests both as absolute non-causation and relative causation. Fourth, "returning to the source" (hwibonban-won) describes how meditation traces effects back through causes to uncaused origin.

Internal variations include the Jogye Order's orthodox emphasis on hwadu transcending causation versus the Taego Order's esoteric view of causation as energy transformation. Seongcheol's "sudden-sudden" position controversially challenged Jinul's "sudden-gradual" framework, creating doctrinal controversy about whether karmic causation persists after awakening. Modern Korean Seon increasingly integrates psychological understanding of trauma as karmic causation.

Critics argue this framework creates inconsistency between denying causation philosophically while affirming karma ethically. Korean Seon responds through the two truths: causation conventionally governs unenlightened beings, while awakened beings engage causation without reification. Contemporary applications include temple stay programs that teach participants to observe causation without attachment, and Engaged Buddhism applying interdependent causation to social issues. Korean Seon therapy addresses suffering by revealing the emptiness of traumatic causal narratives. Compared to Japanese Zen, Korean Seon emphasizes systematic cultivation alongside sudden awakening, while sharing Chinese Chan's philosophical sophistication. Unlike Pure Land traditions' linear karmic causation, Korean Seon stresses transcending causation entirely through direct insight.

*** 1.4.126 Vietnamese Thien Response

Vietnamese Thien Buddhism conceptualizes causation through the integration of Chan immediate awakening, Pure Land devotional causality, and Vietnamese indigenous cosmology emphasizing harmony between human action and natural patterns. Causation operates through tam-nguyen (three sources)—karma, conditions, and Buddha-nature—synthesizing deterministic, probabilistic, and acausal dimensions into practical frameworks for ethical living and meditative realization.

Emperor Trần Nhân Tông (1258-1308), who abdicated to establish the Trúc Lâm (Bamboo Forest) school, articulated Vietnamese Thien's distinctive causality through "samādhi and wisdom equally cultivated" (định-tuệ song-tu). His "Essential Guidelines of Practice" teaches that causation functions conventionally but dissolves in meditative absorption, requiring practitioners to engage both dimensions. Tuệ Trung (1230-1291) emphasized "sudden awakening to gradual cultivation," arguing that recognizing causation's emptiness doesn't eliminate karmic effects, requiring ethical discipline. Thích Thanh Từ (1924-), one of Vietnam's most influential contemporary masters, teaches that causation operates through conscious intention—karma arises from volition, not mechanical action. Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926-2022) globalized Vietnamese Thien causality through "interbeing" (tiep-hien), describing causation as mutual containment where causes include effects and effects include causes in continuous co-arising.

The Avatamsaka Sūtra grounds Vietnamese Thien's holistic causality, particularly its teaching of "interpenetration without obstruction." The Śūraṅgama Sūtra, extremely popular in Vietnamese Buddhism, explains causation as arising from fundamental ignorance yet lacking ultimate substance. The Vimalakīrti Sūtra's teaching of non-dual causation influences Vietnamese Thien's middle way. Thích Nhất Hạnh's commentaries on the Heart Sūtra emphasize how emptiness enables causation.

Four philosophical arguments structure Vietnamese Thien causality: First, nhân-quả (cause-effect) operates through complex matrices—no single cause produces effects, only converging conditions (duyên). Second, business karma (nghiệp-lực) explains how collective actions generate shared consequences, grounding social ethics. Third, consciousness transformation (전식성지) describes how meditative practice doesn't eliminate karma but transforms how consciousness processes causal patterns. Fourth, "no coming, no going" (bất-lai bất-khứ) doctrine maintains that causation operates conventionally without ultimate reality.

Internal variations include Northern Trúc Lâm emphasis on sudden causation-transcendence versus Southern Pure Land schools' stress on linear devotional causality—recitation causes rebirth. The Engaged Buddhism movement, pioneered by Thích Nhất Hạnh, emphasizes understanding interdependent causation as basis for social action. Hòa Hảo Buddhist reform movement simplified causality for rural practitioners.

Critics question whether affirming both karma and emptiness creates logical contradiction. Vietnamese Thien responds through two truths doctrine: causation conventionally governs saṃsāra, ultimately lacks substance. Contemporary applications include reconciliation practices addressing Vietnam War trauma through recontextualizing causal narratives—understanding perpetrators and victims as mutually conditioned reduces hatred. Mindfulness-based stress reduction adapts Vietnamese Thien's causal analysis to clinical psychology. Thích Nhất Hạnh's "Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings" apply interdependent causation to ecological and social ethics. Compared to Thai Theravāda's linear Abhidharmic causality, Vietnamese Thien emphasizes non-dual mutual causation, while sharing Chinese Buddhism's systematic philosophy balanced with accessible practice prioritizing direct meditative experience over intellectual analysis.

*** 1.4.127 Shugendo Response

Shugendo, the Japanese syncretic mountain asceticism tradition, conceptualizes causation through the integration of esoteric Buddhist karmic causality, Shinto kami-mediated causation, and Daoist correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm. Causation operates through reiryoku (spiritual power) manifesting as gen-in-ga (mystical cause-effect) where ritual action, mountain pilgrimage, and ascetic practices generate immediate transformative effects by harmonizing practitioners with cosmic forces embodied in sacred landscapes.

En no Gyōja (634-701 CE), the legendary founder, established Shugendo's distinctive causality by integrating Buddhist karmic retribution with indigenous Japanese mountain kami worship, teaching that mountains embody causal power—pilgrimage through mountain mandala causes spiritual transformation by aligning body-mind with sacred geography. The systematization during the Heian period (794-1185) incorporated esoteric Buddhist causality from Tendai and Shingon schools. Shōbō (832-909), founder of the Tōzan-ha school, taught that ritual performance causes supernatural effects by manipulating the correspondence between microcosmic body and macrocosmic universe. Masuda Shokai (1910-2000) modernized Shugendo causality, interpreting yamabushi practices as psychological techniques causing consciousness transformation rather than literally manipulating external forces.

The Lotus Sūtra's teaching that Buddha-nature universally pervades reality grounds Shugendo's view that mountains embody enlightenment. The Mahāvairocana Sūtra's explanation of ritual causality—mudras, mantras, and visualization cause union with cosmic Buddha—provides esoteric Buddhist foundation. Indigenous texts like "Shugendo Himitsu Shūyō Kudenshū" describe how specific practices on specific mountains cause particular spiritual attainments. The "Shugen Sanjūban Shin-gi" explains causation through sanmitsu (three mysteries) doctrine—synchronized body, speech, and mind actions cause rapid enlightenment.

Three core arguments structure Shugendo causality: First, ritual efficacy operates through correspondence—performing specific practices at specific locations causes transformations because microcosmic ritual actions resonate with macrocosmic patterns. Second, mountains themselves possess causal agency as manifestations of kami and Buddhist deities—interaction with sacred geography causes purification and empowerment. Third, ascetic practices (extreme fasting, waterfall meditation, fire walking) cause altered consciousness states that reveal deeper causal patterns normally obscured by ordinary awareness.

Internal variations include Tōzan-ha school's more Buddhist emphasis on karmic causality versus Honzan-ha school's more Shinto emphasis on kami-mediated causation. Some lineages emphasize gradual causality requiring years of mountain training, while others teach sudden transformation through intense peak experiences. Modern Shugendo practitioners debate whether ritual efficacy operates through psychological suggestion or genuine supernatural causation.

Critics dismiss Shugendo causality as superstition conflating correlation with causation. Practitioners respond that Western causal paradigms inadequately explain spiritual transformation, and that experiential verification through practice validates Shugendo's causal claims. Contemporary applications include wilderness therapy programs adapting Shugendo's nature-based causality, and ritual performance as cultural preservation. Some practitioners integrate Shugendo causality with quantum physics, proposing consciousness affects material reality. Compared to mainstream Japanese Buddhism, Shugendo emphasizes immediate ritual causality over gradual karmic causation, while sharing esoteric Buddhism's view of enlightenment accessible through body-based practices rather than intellectual understanding alone.

*** 1.4.128 Tenrikyo Response

Tenrikyo conceptualizes causation through the unique doctrine of innen (causality) grounded in Oyagami's (God-the-Parent's) providential governance and the principle of kashimono-karimono (the body is borrowed, the mind is our own). Causation operates through tsukaikata (usage of mind)—how humans use their minds creates either hokori (mental dust) causing suffering, or yoki-gurashi (joyous life) aligned with divine intention, with Oyagami providing circumstances that teach souls to mature spiritually through understanding true causation.

Nakayama Miki (1798-1887), foundress of Tenrikyo, received direct revelation from Oyagami beginning in 1838, establishing a causality framework distinct from both Buddhism and Shinto. Her "Ofudesaki" (Tip of the Writing Brush) systematically explains causation through divine providence—apparent accidents and illnesses are actually Oyagami's guidance teaching correct mind-usage. Iburi Izo (1833-1907), the first Honseki (spiritual intermediary), clarified that causation operates through both individual karma-like patterns and Oyagami's active intervention adjusting circumstances. Post-war leaders like Nakayama Shozen (1905-1967) modernized Tenrikyo causality by emphasizing psychological and social dimensions—mental attitudes cause material circumstances through both spiritual and natural mechanisms.

The "Ofudesaki" provides primary scriptural authority, with verses like "This universe is the body of God. Ponder this in all matters" (III:40-41) grounding causation in divine immanence. The "Mikagura-uta" (The Songs for the Service) describes creation causality—Oyagami created humans for joyous life, with suffering arising from misaligned mind-usage. The "Osashizu" (Timely Talks) compilation contains direct divine communications explaining specific causal relationships.

Four core arguments structure Tenrikyo causality: First, the kashimono-karimono principle—bodies are borrowed from God, minds are given to use freely—establishes that mental causation operates within divinely-provided physical conditions. Second, hokori (dust) accumulation explains suffering causality—eight types of mental misdirection (miserliness, covetousness, hatred, self-love, grudge-bearing, anger, greed, arrogance) cause both spiritual and physical problems. Third, hinokishin (voluntary service) causality—selfless service removes dust and creates merit, improving circumstances. Fourth, ten-no-ri (divine providence) means Oyagami actively arranges circumstances to teach souls, transcending mechanical karma with intentional divine pedagogy.

Internal variations include whether causation operates primarily through spiritual laws resembling karma versus more direct divine intervention. Some emphasize Oyagami's parental care actively protecting believers, while others stress individual responsibility for mind-usage creating consequences. Modern Tenrikyo scholars debate integrating scientific causality with religious teachings.

Critics argue Tenrikyo's causality risks blaming victims for suffering and anthropomorphizing ultimate reality. Tenrikyo responds that understanding divine causation empowers people to transform circumstances through hinokishin and mental purification, and that Oyagami's parental nature makes anthropomorphism appropriate. Contemporary applications include medical missions understanding illness as teaching opportunity, disaster relief expressing hinokishin causality, and psychological counseling addressing how thought patterns cause suffering. Tenrikyo's International Department applies causality teachings to global issues, understanding international conflict as collective dust. Compared to Buddhism, Tenrikyo emphasizes theistic causation and divine providence while sharing focus on mental states causing material conditions. Unlike Christianity, Tenrikyo stresses joyous acceptance over sin-redemption causality.

*** 1.4.129 Konkokyo Response

Konkokyo articulates causation through the doctrine of Tenchi-Kane-no-Kami's (Principal Deity of the Universe) continuous mediation and the principle of aiyo-kakeyo (mutual dependence)—causation operates as reciprocal relationship between divine and human realms, where Kami needs humanity's faith-practice as humanity needs Kami's blessings, creating interdependent causality transcending both mechanistic determinism and arbitrary divine will.

Founder Bunjiro Kawate (1814-1883), who received revelation from Konjin (originally considered a malevolent deity) in 1859, revolutionized Japanese religious causality by teaching that apparent misfortunes aren't punishments but divine guidance teaching deeper reliance on Kami. Taking the religious name Konko Daijin, he established Toritsugi (divine mediation) as causal mechanism—mediators channel blessings and guidance, actively participating in causation rather than passively accepting fate. His "Teachings of Konko Daijin" emphasizes that causation operates through living relationship with Kami rather than impersonal laws. Setsutane Konko (1909-1991), the fourth spiritual leader, modernized Konkokyo causality by emphasizing human agency—while Kami provides possibilities, humans actualize them through faithful practice.

The "Konkokyo Scriptures" (Konko Daijin Oboegaki) provide primary authority, containing Konko Daijin's teachings on causation through divine-human relationship. The "Golden Ways to Kami" compilation emphasizes that causation operates through sincere faith rather than mechanical ritual. The daily prayers "Tenchi-Negai" express the mutual causation—Kami's blessings enable human flourishing, human gratitude strengthens divine presence.

Four core arguments structure Konkokyo causality: First, Toritsugi mediation establishes that causation operates through personal relationships rather than impersonal forces—mediators affect divine-human causation through intercession. Second, aiyo-kakeyo (mutual dependence) means Kami and humanity mutually cause each other's fulfillment—Kami achieves purpose through human happiness, humans achieve happiness through Kami's guidance. Third, okage (divine favor) causality explains that blessings result from sincere faith regardless of ritual correctness, emphasizing intentional relationship over formal procedure. Fourth, collective causation operates through family and community—individual actions affect group destiny, requiring social responsibility.

Internal variations include whether Toritsugi functions as supernatural causal intervention or psychological encouragement. Some emphasize Kami's active miraculous intervention, while others interpret causation more naturalistically as psychological and social processes blessed by Kami. The American Konkokyo Church developed culturally adapted causal explanations emphasizing therapeutic benefits.

Critics question whether mutual dependence between infinite Kami and finite humans makes philosophical sense, and whether emphasizing divine favor creates passive dependence. Konkokyo responds that aiyo-kakeyo doesn't limit Kami but expresses divine nature as relational love, and that recognizing divine causation empowers rather than disempowers human agency. Contemporary applications include medical contexts where Toritsugi mediators support patients through illness, understanding healing as cooperating with divine causation. Disaster response emphasizes community support as divine causation manifesting through human compassion. Interfaith dialogue emphasizes relational causality common to personalist theologies. Compared to Shinto, Konkokyo emphasizes personal relationship with singular Kami over plural kami causation. Unlike Christianity, Konkokyo stresses mutual dependence rather than unilateral divine sovereignty, creating more egalitarian causal partnership.

*** 1.4.130 Oomoto Response

Oomoto conceptualizes causation through the distinctive synthesis of Shinto cosmology, spirit-world mediation, and eschatological renovation, articulating causation as operating simultaneously through normal natural laws and supernatural spiritual forces, with increasing spiritual causation as the world approaches yonaoshi (world renewal). Causation involves complex interactions between material, spiritual, and divine realms, with spirit entities mediating between human actions and cosmic consequences according to reikai (spirit world) governance under Mizu-no-mitama and Izu-no-me principles.

Nao Deguchi (1836-1918), Oomoto's foundress, received revelations from Ushitora-no-Konjin beginning in 1892, establishing Oomoto's distinctive causality through her Ofudesaki (Divine Writings). These texts describe causation operating through spirit-world mediation—kami and spiritual beings actively intervene in material causation according to divine plan for world transformation. Her son-in-law Onisaburo Deguchi (1871-1948) systematized Oomoto theology through his "Reikai Monogatari" (Tales of the Spirit World), a massive work explaining causation through spirit-realm geography and governance. His doctrine of yorishiro (divine vessels) teaches that humans can become channels for divine causation. Post-war leadership under Naohi Deguchi (1902-1990) emphasized universal brotherhood, interpreting causation as fundamentally moral—ethical actions cause peace, immoral actions cause conflict.

The Ofudesaki of Nao Deguchi provides primary scriptural authority, describing the coming divine restructuring of causation itself—current suffering results from corrupted causality that will be restored. The Reikai Monogatari maps spirit-world causation in elaborate detail. Oomoto practices chinkon-kishin (spirit pacification and divine return) and kotodama (word-soul) theory, holding that sounds cause spiritual effects.

Five core arguments structure Oomoto causality: First, three-realm causation operates through material world (genkai), spiritual world (reikai), and divine world (shinkai), with ascending causation from divine will through spiritual mediation to material manifestation. Second, kotodama causation—sounds possess inherent creative power, with correct pronunciation causing spiritual effects regardless of speaker's consciousness. Third, chinkon-kishin practice enables practitioners to channel divine causation, becoming instruments of higher will. Fourth, eschatological causation means normal causal patterns are breaking down as world approaches renewal, making current events comprehensible only through prophetic framework. Fifth, collective karma explanation—humanity's collective spiritual condition causes global crises, requiring collective spiritual transformation.

Internal variations include more literal versus symbolic interpretations of spirit-world causation. Some members emphasize actual spirit entities mediating causation, while others interpret this psychologically as deep consciousness layers. The Omoto-affiliated Byakko Shinko Kai developed related but distinct causal teachings emphasizing thought-form causation.

Critics dismiss Oomoto causality as unfalsifiable spiritual speculation. Oomoto responds that direct experience through chinkon-kishin validates spiritual causation, and that materialist paradigms inadequately explain consciousness and meaning. Contemporary applications include interfaith work grounded in universal brotherhood as causal principle, Esperanto promotion based on linguistic causation theories, and organic farming understanding agriculture as spiritual-material causation. Art programs express spiritual causation through creative practice. Compared to mainstream Shinto, Oomoto emphasizes systematic spirit-world cosmology and eschatological causation. Unlike Buddhism, Oomoto stresses personal spirit entities rather than impersonal karmic causation.

*** 1.4.131 Seicho-no-Ie Response

Seicho-no-Ie conceptualizes causation through the radical idealist doctrine of Jissō (Reality), where true causation operates exclusively in the spiritual/mental realm while material causation is fundamentally illusory. The core principle shinso-jitai (true form of reality) asserts that physical phenomena are projections of consciousness—mind causes matter, not vice versa—liberating adherents from material determinism through recognizing their identity with God and inherent perfection that was never actually lost.

Masaharu Taniguchi (1893-1985) founded Seicho-no-Ie in 1930 after spiritual awakening experience, synthesizing elements of Omoto Shinto, New Thought Christianity, Yogacara Buddhism, and Western idealism into distinctive causality teaching. His magnum opus "Seimei no Jissō" (The Truth of Life) articulates that apparent material causation results from mistaken consciousness—disease, poverty, and suffering don't have physical causes but arise from false mental patterns. His teaching of shinsokan meditation as primary causal mechanism enables practitioners to align consciousness with perfect Reality, dissolving apparent problems. His wife Teruko Taniguchi (1909-2008) continued teaching that causation operates from consciousness to manifestation, never the reverse. Current leadership under Masanobu Taniguchi (1951-) has developed ecological applications, teaching that environmental causation operates through collective consciousness.

"Seimei no Jissō" provides primary textual authority, asserting "Man is a child of God. Therefore he is naturally good, wise, and divine." The periodical "Seicho-no-Ie" continuously elaborates causal teachings. Buddhist Consciousness-Only doctrine provides philosophical foundation, interpreted as supporting mind-only causation. Christian Science influenced the rejection of material causation. Shintoistic emphasis on kami as creative consciousness supports idealist causality.

Five core arguments structure Seicho-no-Ie causality: First, consciousness primacy—mind causes matter because material world is consciousness projection, inverting materialist causation. Second, perfect Reality (Jissō) doctrine establishes that apparent suffering and evil lack causal reality—they're illusions from mistaken consciousness rather than effects of real causes. Third, shinsokan meditation causes transformation by aligning consciousness with perfect Reality, dissolving apparent problems at their mental source. Fourth, kotoba no chikara (power of words) means verbal expressions cause material effects—positive affirmations literally create positive circumstances. Fifth, senzo-kuyō (ancestor veneration) causality teaches that honoring ancestors transforms inherited karmic patterns.

Internal variations include debates about how literally to interpret material world's illusory nature. Some treat physical causation as absolutely unreal, while others acknowledge conventional validity while asserting ultimate mind-causation. American Seicho-no-Ie Truth of Life Movement adapted teachings to Western contexts. The post-2000 environmental turn raised questions about whether rejecting material reality supports ecological irresponsibility.

Critics argue this causality denies suffering's reality, blames victims for illness, and contradicts scientific understanding. Seicho-no-Ie responds that recognizing perfect Reality doesn't dismiss suffering's apparent reality but empowers transformation by addressing causal root (consciousness) rather than symptoms (circumstances). Acknowledging mind-causation liberates rather than blames. Contemporary applications include healing testimonials attributed to consciousness transformation, prosperity teaching based on abundance-consciousness causing wealth, and recent ecological causality teaching that environmental problems arise from separated consciousness—healing requires recognizing unity with nature. Compared to Christian Science, Seicho-no-Ie incorporates more Asian philosophy while sharing idealist causation. Unlike Buddhism, Seicho-no-Ie emphasizes inherent perfection over karmic causation requiring purification.

*** 1.4.132 Perfect Liberty Kyodan Response

Perfect Liberty Kyodan (PL) articulates causation through the distinctive synthesis of mishirase (divine notifications), the artistic life principle, and the self-expression theology captured in the motto "Life is Art." Causation operates primarily through Mioya-no-Mikoto (Parent-God) actively communicating through physical symptoms, circumstances, and events that function as divine messages rather than mechanical cause-effect sequences, with proper interpretation and artistic self-expression dissolving suffering by aligning individual expression with divine creative flow.

Tokuharu Miki (1871-1938) founded the predecessor movement Hito-no-Michi (Path of Man), teaching causation through mabashi (prayer mediation) where leaders absorb followers' karma. His son Tokuchika Miki (1900-1983) reformed the movement as Perfect Liberty Kyodan in 1946, developing the distinctive mishirase causality—physical symptoms aren't caused by pathogens primarily but manifest as divine communications about misaligned life-expression. His "Twenty-One Precepts" systematize PL causality, particularly precept three: "Man suffers if he does not manifest himself" and precept seventeen: "Everything is a mirror." These establish that suffering is caused not by external factors but by blocked self-expression, and that circumstances mirror internal states. Subsequent leadership has maintained this causality while emphasizing practical applications through art education and sports programs.

The "Twenty-One Precepts" provide primary doctrinal authority, functioning as systematic causality guide. The daily prayer "Mioya-no-Mikoto Arigato Gozaimasu" (Thank you Parent-God) expresses gratitude recognition as causal mechanism—thankfulness causes blessings by aligning consciousness with divine abundance. The teaching "Ware sunawachi kami nari" (I am one with God) grounds causation in divine identity—human creativity participates in divine causation.

Five core arguments structure PL causality: First, mishirase doctrine establishes that physical and circumstantial problems aren't mechanically caused but divinely communicated—illness manifests to teach proper living. Second, self-expression causality asserts that blocked artistic/personal expression causes suffering because humans fulfill divine purpose through unique creativity. Third, oyakozuke (parent-child connection) creates karmic links within PL—ministers absorb followers' negative karma through prayer, transferring mishirase. Fourth, mirror principle means circumstances reflect internal consciousness—external problems are caused by internal disharmony. Fifth, gratitude causality teaches that thankfulness itself causes positive outcomes regardless of circumstances.

Internal variations include interpretation of mishirase as literal divine communication versus symbolic interpretation as psychosomatic symptoms. Some emphasize ministers' unique karma-transfer ability, while others stress individual responsibility for interpreting mishirase. American PL churches adapted causality teachings to Western therapeutic frameworks.

Critics argue mishirase doctrine blames victims for illness and resembles unfalsifiable pseudo-science. PL responds that mishirase empowers rather than blames by providing actionable interpretation—instead of passive suffering, believers actively respond to divine guidance. The framework has pragmatic validation through testified transformations. Contemporary applications include art therapy programs treating illness through creative expression, sports initiatives understanding athletic development as spiritual discipline channeling divine creativity, and lifestyle guidance interpreting various symptoms as specific divine communications. The large-scale PL fireworks festivals express theology that beauty itself causes spiritual elevation. Compared to Christian Science, PL emphasizes artistic expression over metaphysical idealism. Unlike traditional Buddhism, PL stresses creative self-expression rather than ego-transcendence, and divine communication rather than impersonal karma.

*** 1.4.133 Zoroastrianism Response

Zoroastrianism articulates causation through the dualistic framework of asha (truth/order) versus druj (falsehood/chaos), where causation operates through the cosmic conflict between Ahura Mazda's creative ordering and Angra Mainyu's destructive opposition. Rather than mechanical determinism or arbitrary divine will, causation functions through moral choice activating spiritual forces—human decisions between good and evil thoughts, words, and deeds become genuine causes affecting both individual destiny and cosmic outcome, with material effects following spiritual causes in the divinely ordered cosmos.

The prophet Zarathustra (circa 1500-1000 BCE, dates disputed) revolutionized ancient Iranian religion by establishing ethical monotheism where causation centers on moral agency. His Gathas (hymns in the Avesta) articulate a causality where human choice genuinely affects cosmic battle between order and chaos—believers aren't passive recipients of fate but active participants whose decisions cause victory or defeat of good. The Sassanian period (224-651 CE) systematized Zoroastrian causality through texts like the Bundahishn (Creation), explaining cosmogonic causation—Ahura Mazda created material world as trap for evil, establishing that physical causation serves spiritual purposes. High priest Tansar (3rd century CE) emphasized that ritual purity causes spiritual protection while pollution causes vulnerability to demonic influence. Modern Parsi scholar Dastur Khurshed S. Dabu (1909-2001) interpreted causality through both traditional and scientific frameworks, arguing compatibility.

The Avesta, particularly the Yasna containing Zarathustra's Gathas, provides scriptural foundation. Yasna 30 articulates fundamental dualism: "Two primal Spirits...each of a different activity...the better and the bad," establishing causation through opposing cosmic principles. Yasna 31 emphasizes choice-based causation: "By the action they perform/and the word they speak/each is according to his nature." The Vendidad details purification causality—specific rituals cause removal of demonic pollution. The Bundahishn explains creation causation and eschatological causation toward Frashokereti (renovation).

Four core arguments structure Zoroastrian causality: First, ethical dualism establishes that causation operates through moral opposition—good causes order and life, evil causes chaos and death, without synthesis. Second, free will doctrine asserts genuine libertarian causation—humans truly originate causal chains through choices, not merely manifesting predetermined patterns. Third, ritual efficacy means ceremonial actions cause spiritual effects—fire rituals, purity observances, and prayers actively strengthen asha against druj. Fourth, eschatological causation directs history toward Frashokereti when accumulated good actions will cause evil's final defeat and cosmic renovation.

Internal variations include harder versus softer dualism—some emphasize Angra Mainyu's independence, others his subordination to Ahura Mazda's ultimate sovereignty. Zurvanite interpretations posited time (Zurvan) as ultimate cause generating both good and evil. Parsi interpretations often emphasize monotheism more than dualism, while Iranian Zoroastrians may emphasize dualism more strongly. Contemporary liberal interpretations treat dualism symbolically as psychological forces rather than cosmic entities.

Critics argue dualism creates logical problems about evil's origin and challenges divine omnipotence. Zoroastrianism responds that dualism solves the problem of evil better than monotheism—evil genuinely exists as opposing force, not divine creation or privation. Limited dualism preserves both divine goodness and evil's reality. Contemporary applications include environmental ethics grounded in asha—ecological destruction serves druj, conservation serves asha. Bioethics emphasizes life-promoting causation aligned with asha. Political theology interprets democracy as institutionalizing ethical choice. Compared to Manicheanism, Zoroastrianism affirms material world's goodness despite corruption. Unlike Hindu karma, Zoroastrianism emphasizes eschatological resolution rather than cyclical causation.

*** 1.4.134 Parsism Response

Parsism (the form of Zoroastrianism practiced by the Parsi community descended from Persian immigrants to India) conceptualizes causation through the integration of classical Zoroastrian dualism with Hindu philosophical influences and modern scientific rationalism, resulting in distinctive emphasis on moral causation operating through divine law (daena) while accommodating natural causation within providential framework. Causation operates through Ahura Mazda's ordering principle (asha) manifesting in both ethical and natural laws, with human agency participating through humat, hukht, huvarst (good thoughts, good words, good deeds) that cause both worldly and spiritual consequences.

The Parsi migration to Gujarat (8th-10th centuries CE) created distinctive theological development through sustained engagement with Hindu philosophy. Dastur Dhalla (1875-1956) modernized Parsi theology by integrating Zoroastrian causality with scientific understanding, arguing in his "Zoroastrian Theology" that ancient dualism expresses psychological and ethical truths compatible with natural causation. He reinterpreted Angra Mainyu as symbol of evil potential rather than cosmic entity, making causation more monistic. Ervad Sheriarji Dadabhai Bharucha (1912-1996) defended traditional dualistic causality while accommodating modernity. Khojeste Mistree (1951-) has emphasized environmental causation through asha—ecological harmony follows from ethical living, environmental destruction from violation of cosmic order.

The Avesta remains scriptural authority, though Parsi interpretation often emphasizes metaphorical over literal reading. The Gathas' emphasis on ethical choice provides foundation for moral causation. The Vendidad's purity laws establish ritual causation, though modern Parsis debate their contemporary application. The Persian Rivayats (correspondence between Indian and Iranian priests, 15th-18th centuries) addressed causal questions about ritual efficacy and pollution. Parsi prayers like the Kusti ceremony daily renew commitment to ethical causation.

Four core arguments structure Parsi causality: First, integration of divine and natural causation—Ahura Mazda operates through natural laws rather than arbitrary intervention, making scientific and religious causation compatible. Second, moral causation primacy—while acknowledging physical causation, Parsism emphasizes that ethical quality of actions determines ultimate consequences beyond immediate effects. Third, evolutionary causation—some modern Parsis interpret cosmic history as progressive revelation of asha, with humanity causing advancement toward perfection through ethical choices. Fourth, communal causation—individual actions affect community destiny, grounding strong Parsi emphasis on social responsibility and philanthropy.

Internal variations include traditional versus reformist interpretation of ritual causation. Orthodox Parsis maintain that purity rituals cause spiritual effects regardless of participant understanding, while reformists emphasize ethical intention over ceremonial correctness. Gender controversies involve whether contamination causality applies equally or differently to women. Indian versus Iranian Parsi communities sometimes differ on tradition-modernity balance.

Critics argue that accommodating scientific causality dilutes distinctive Zoroastrian dualism. Parsis respond that evolution represents sophisticated theological development, not compromise—understanding asha as expressed through natural law deepens rather than diminishes Zoroastrianism. Contemporary applications include prominent Parsi philanthropy grounded in causality understanding that communal welfare contributions cause social harmony and divine favor. Tata family's industrial development exemplifies prosperity theology where ethical business causes both material success and spiritual merit. Environmental initiatives interpret conservation as serving asha. Interfaith dialogue emphasizes universal ethical causation common to religions. Compared to Iranian Zoroastrianism, Parsism shows stronger Hindu philosophical influence and accommodation with modernity. Unlike Christian providence, Parsism maintains stronger dualistic causation where evil genuinely opposes good rather than serving divine purposes.

*** 1.4.135 Zurvanism Response

Zurvanism articulates causation through the distinctive doctrine of Zurvan (Infinite Time) as ultimate principle transcending the dualism of Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu, establishing causation as operating through temporal necessity rather than moral choice alone. In this heterodox Zoroastrian interpretation, causation functions through predetermined cosmic cycles, with time itself as the first cause generating both creative and destructive principles, creating fatalistic causality contrasting with orthodox Zoroastrianism's emphasis on free will and moral agency determining outcomes.

Zurvanism developed during the Achaemenid period (550-330 BCE) and dominated during Sassanian period (224-651 CE) before Islam's arrival. The cosmogonic myth recorded by Armenian Christian sources describes Zurvan sacrificing for offspring—doubt creates Angra Mainyu while faith creates Ahura Mazda, with Zurvan granting each 9,000 years of dominion. This establishes mechanical temporal causation over ethical causation—outcomes follow from temporal position in cycle rather than moral quality alone. The magi (priestly class) who embraced Zurvanism developed elaborate astrological causation, seeing celestial movements as temporal causes determining earthly effects. Modern scholarship, particularly by Robert Charles Zaehner (1913-1974), reconstructed Zurvanite causality from fragments, arguing it represented fatalistic response to political powerlessness.

No independent Zurvanite scripture survives, with doctrine reconstructed from Zoroastrian texts like Bundahishn, Armenian Christian polemics by Eznik of Kolb (5th century), and Islamic era accounts. The Bundahishn's temporal cosmology with 12,000-year cosmic history divided into periods reflects Zurvanite influence. Pahlavi texts containing astrological material preserve Zurvanite causal frameworks. The "Menog-i Khrad" (Spirit of Wisdom) discusses fate versus free will, reflecting Zurvanite tensions.

Four core arguments structure Zurvanite causality: First, temporal determinism—Zurvan as infinite time constitutes ultimate cause from which both good and evil necessarily emanate, transcending moral dualism with metaphysical monism. Second, cyclical causation—cosmic history follows predetermined pattern through creation, mixture, separation, and renovation, with events caused by temporal position in cycle rather than contemporary choices alone. Third, astrological causation—celestial movements represent temporal causes determining terrestrial effects, creating elaborate divinatory system. Fourth, fatalistic soteriology—while individual effort matters, ultimate salvation depends on temporal position relative to Frashokereti (renovation) more than personal merit.

Internal variations existed between extreme fatalism denying human agency and moderate positions preserving moral responsibility within temporal framework. Priestly Zurvanism emphasized ritual mastery over astral causation, while popular Zurvanism stressed acceptance of fate. Scholarly debate continues whether Zurvanism represented coherent school or diverse interpretations emphasizing temporal themes.

Critics, including orthodox Zoroastrians like Zadspram (9th century), attacked Zurvanism for undermining ethical monotheism and moral causation central to Zarathustra's message. Fatalism threatened to dissolve accountability—if temporal position determines outcomes, righteous living seems pointless. Zurvanites apparently responded that understanding temporal causation enables working with rather than against cosmic patterns, and that moral living remains important within temporal framework even if not ultimately determinative.

Zurvanism's decline after Islamic conquest likely reflected incompatibility with both Islamic and orthodox Zoroastrian emphasis on moral agency. Contemporary relevance includes philosophical interest in temporal causation theories and determinism debates. Some modern interpreters see Zurvanite fatalism as psychological response to historical trauma—when political action seems futile, cosmic determinism provides meaning. Process philosophy's emphasis on temporality resonates with Zurvanite insights. Compared to orthodox Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism subordinates ethical to temporal causation. Unlike Greek fate concepts, Zurvanite causation operates through time-deity rather than impersonal necessity, though sharing deterministic implications.
