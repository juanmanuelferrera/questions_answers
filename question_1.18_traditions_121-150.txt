*** 1.18.121 Shinto Response

Shinto conceives space (ma/間) not as empty void but as sacred interval charged with divine presence (kami), where every location possesses unique spiritual character determined by its relationship to celestial and terrestrial deities. Space functions as living medium for divine-human interaction.

Historical development emerged from prehistoric animism evident in Jomon period (14,000-300 BCE) sacred sites, systematized during Kofun period (250-538 CE) when Chinese cosmological concepts merged with indigenous beliefs. Nara period (710-794) witnessed formal articulation through shrine architecture establishing sacred geography. Medieval Ryobu Shinto integrated Buddhist spatial concepts, while Edo period (1603-1868) nativist movements emphasized indigenous conceptions. Meiji Restoration (1868-1912) created State Shinto's hierarchical sacred geography centered on imperial shrines.

Key texts include Kojiki (712 CE) and Nihon Shoki (720 CE) describing spatial creation through Izanagi and Izanami's generation of islands from primordial chaos. Kogoshui (807) elaborates ritual spatial delineation. Modern thinkers like Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801) emphasized native spatial consciousness, while Ueda Kenji analyzed ma as uniquely Japanese spatial aesthetic.

Core arguments hold space as fundamentally discontinuous, comprising distinct zones of varying sacredness. Kami inhabit specific locations (shintai) while sacred boundaries (shimenawa) delineate pure from profane space. Architecture embodies this through torii gates marking transitions between mundane and sacred realms. Natural features—mountains (yama), forests (mori), waterfalls—concentrate divine presence.

Kojiki states: "The two deities stood on the Floating Bridge of Heaven and, lowering the jeweled spear, stirred with it." This describes spatial generation through divine action. Shrine protocols emphasize directional significance, with east-west orientation reflecting solar mythology.

Internal variations distinguish shrine Shinto emphasizing fixed sacred centers from folk traditions recognizing portable sanctity. Sectarian movements developed divergent cosmologies, while academic Shinto analyzed space phenomenologically.

Buddhist critiques characterize Shinto space as unphilosophical attachment to particular locations contradicting universal emptiness. Western rationalism dismisses sacred geography as primitive animism. Confucian thought questions ritual spatial distinctions lacking ethical foundation.

Contemporary applications appear in architectural theory through concepts like ma influencing modern design, environmental movements emphasizing sacred ecology, and pilgrimage practices (junrei) creating networked sacred geography. Urban shrine preservation maintains spiritual nodes within secular cities.

Comparatively, Shinto ma resembles Daoist qi-filled space and Aboriginal songline geography while contrasting Cartesian homogeneous extension and Islamic divine omnipresence. Sacred interval parallels Jewish makom theology but emphasizes polytheistic multiplicity over monotheistic unity.
