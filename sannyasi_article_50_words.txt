The Sannyasi in the Dinosaur Mask (50 words)

A sannyasi in Vaishnava robes wearing funny hats and dinosaur masks while dancing ridiculously, believing chanting justifies everything, violates shastra. Bhagavad Gita 6.1 and Hari-bhakti-vilasa prescribe gravity and exemplary conduct. Thinking "chanting excuses all" is namno balad yasya—sinning on chanting's strength. Reform behavior or renounce sannyasa dress immediately.
