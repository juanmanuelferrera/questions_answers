Nihilism articulates being through *meaninglessness* (existence without inherent purpose), *value negation* (no objective values-morals), *truth skepticism* (no absolute truth), *God's death* (Nietzsche—highest values devalue themselves), and *nothingness* (being confronting void), emerging from Nietzsche's diagnosis of European culture (Christian morality's collapse, Enlightenment reason insufficient replacement), developing through Russian nihilism (Turgenev, political radicals), existential nihilism (life's absurdity), epistemological nihilism (knowledge impossible), moral nihilism (ethics baseless), distinguishing passive (despair, resignation) versus active (Nietzsche's creative destruction, revaluation), emphasizing modernity's crisis (traditional meaning-sources exhausted, scientific worldview mechanistic-purposeless, individualism isolating), requiring response either despairing acceptance or courageous creation (Übermensch creating values, eternal return affirming life), influencing existentialism, postmodernism, contemporary culture, making Nihilism both philosophical position and cultural diagnosis, though debated whether self-refuting (claiming no truth while asserting nihilism true), necessary stage toward revaluation or endpoint, and how distinguishing critical clearing from destructive despair, creating ongoing tensions about meaning's possibility, values' grounding, and existence's purpose in post-religious, post-metaphysical age requiring either new foundations or learning living without them.

*** 1.23.137 Absurdism Response

Absurdism articulates being through *absurd* (Camus—confrontation between human need for meaning and universe's silence), *revolt* (maintaining search despite impossibility), *Sisyphus* (endless task affirmed), *lucidity* (clear-eyed recognition without escape), and *happiness* (joy in struggle itself), developed by Camus (*Myth of Sisyphus*, *The Stranger*, *The Rebel*) as response to nihilism and existentialism, distinguishing from suicide (evading absurd through death), philosophical suicide (evading through faith-hope-metaphysics like Kierkegaard), and existential creation (Sartre's radical freedom), emphasizing absurd emerging from confrontation (rational being seeking meaning in meaningless universe), requiring neither acceptance (resignation) nor denial (false hope) but revolt (maintaining consciousness, refusing reconciliation), living fully despite meaninglessness, imagining Sisyphus happy (finding meaning in struggle not outcome), extending to political realm (*The Rebel*—rejecting both oppression and revolutionary violence justifying ends), making Absurdism distinctive existential position balancing despair and hope, meaninglessness and engagement, though criticized for inconsistency (why revolt if meaningless?), individualism (insufficient political guidance), and questioned whether sustainable (can one live perpetually in tension?) or inevitably collapsing into either nihilism or meaning-making, creating existential stance affirming life's value without cosmic justification.

*** 1.23.138 Virtue Ethics (Contemporary) Response

Virtue Ethics (Contemporary) articulates being through *character* (ethics as agent-cultivation not action-rules), *eudaimonia* (flourishing as ultimate end), *virtues* (excellences enabling flourishing), *practical wisdom* (*phronesis*—situational judgment), and *moral education* (habituation in good practices), reviving Aristotelian ethics (Anscombe, MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, Nussbaum) against modern moral philosophy's limitations (utilitarianism's calculation, Kantianism's abstraction), emphasizing morality primarily about what persons should be not what actions permissible, virtues as dispositions (courage, temperance, justice, wisdom) developed through practice in communities, ethical knowledge practical not theoretical (perceiving salient features, responding appropriately), requiring moral exemplars and traditions bearing practical rationality, addressing modern questions (virtue ethics for pluralism? What virtues? Whose traditions?) through neo-Aristotelian naturalism (virtues grounded in human nature), pluralistic accounts (multiple virtue traditions), feminist care ethics (relationships not rules), making Virtue Ethics major alternative to consequentialism-deontology, though debated whether providing action-guidance (what should I do?), handling moral disagreement without shared tradition, and grounding virtues (nature? Convention? Function?), creating rich framework emphasizing character, community, practice while facing challenges of pluralism, relativity, and application.
