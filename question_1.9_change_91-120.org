*** 1.9.91 Advaita Response

Change represents the apparent modification of phenomenal forms within maya's illusory domain, while ultimate reality (Brahman) remains eternally changeless and immutable beyond all temporal processes. The Advaita tradition distinguishes between parinamavada (real transformation theory) and vivartavada (apparent transformation theory), ultimately affirming that all becoming exists only at the empirical level of vyavaharika satya. Change appears real to the ignorant consciousness entrapped in avidya, yet upon realization of non-dual awareness, all transformation is recognized as merely apparent modification of the unchanging substrate.

The doctrine of adhyasa (superimposition) explains how changeless consciousness appears to undergo transformation through false identification with changing mental states and bodily conditions. Just as waves appear to arise and subside while the ocean remains essentially unchanged, so too do phenomenal modifications appear within the unchanging field of pure consciousness. The three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep represent different modes of apparent becoming, yet the witnessing consciousness (sakshi) remains eternally unmodified.

Becoming belongs to the realm of nama-rupa (name and form), where the illusory power of maya creates the appearance of multiplicity, causation, and temporal succession. The distinction between cause and effect, creation and destruction, emergence and dissolution—all these belong to the relative perspective of ignorance. From the standpoint of absolute truth (paramarthika satya), no real change ever occurs; Brahman alone exists, eternal, immutable, and complete.

The practical path involves discriminating (viveka) between the changing and the changeless, recognizing that one's true nature as atman remains forever untouched by the flux of phenomenal existence. Through sustained meditation on "neti neti" (not this, not this), the aspirant withdraws identification from all changing phenomena until only the changeless witness remains. This realization dissolves the very framework within which change appears, revealing the eternal present where becoming has never truly occurred. Liberation (moksha) means recognizing that one has never actually been subject to change or becoming, despite appearances to the contrary in the dream-like world of maya.

*** 1.9.92 Vishishtadvaita Response

Change constitutes real transformation of prakrti (material nature) under the governance of Brahman as the inner controller, with all becoming representing genuine modification of the Lord's body while the divine essence remains immutable. Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita affirms both the reality of transformation and the unchanging nature of the supreme Self, rejecting the Advaita position that change is merely illusory. The universe undergoes real parinamavada (actual transformation) during cycles of creation, sustenance, and dissolution, with matter and souls forming the body of Brahman in various states.

The relationship between the unchanging Brahman and the changing universe operates through the principle of sarira-sariri-bhava (body-soul relationship). Just as the soul remains essentially unchanging while its body undergoes continuous modification, so too does Brahman remain immutable while the material universe experiences genuine transformation. This intimate non-dual relationship allows for real becoming without compromising divine transcendence or perfection.

Becoming manifests through the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) that constitute prakrti's dynamic nature. During cosmic creation (srishti), these qualities separate from their equilibrium state and produce the manifest universe through real transformation. Individual souls (jivas) experience becoming through their embodiment in material forms, undergoing genuine change in their conditioned state while retaining their essential nature as conscious entities. This change includes the accumulation and exhaustion of karma, the migration through various life forms, and the evolution toward spiritual perfection.

The Lord as Narayana orchestrates all becoming through His Sankalpa (divine will) while remaining internally unchanged by these processes. His omniscience encompasses all temporal transformations; His omnipotence directs every modification; yet His essential nature as infinite consciousness, bliss, and perfection admits no alteration. The devotional path recognizes that genuine change occurs in the realm of prakrti and within the conditioned experience of jivas, requiring divine grace to transform ignorance into knowledge, bondage into liberation. Prapatti (self-surrender) becomes the means by which the soul undergoes its ultimate transformation—not into something other than itself, but into the full realization of its eternal relationship with the unchanging Lord.

*** 1.9.93 Dvaita Response

Change belongs exclusively to the material realm (jada prakrti) and to dependent conscious entities (svatantra jivas) whose experiences undergo genuine transformation, while the Supreme Being Vishnu remains absolutely immutable, eternally perfect, and independent. Madhvacharya's Dvaita philosophy establishes five eternal distinctions (pancha-bheda) that structure all becoming: between God and souls, God and matter, souls and matter, one soul and another, and one material entity and another. These permanent differences ensure that change never affects the hierarchy of reality.

Becoming manifests through real temporal succession governed by divine will, with creation, sustenance, and dissolution representing actual transformations of prakrti under Vishnu's sovereign control. Unlike Advaita's illusory change or Vishishtadvaita's conception of the universe as God's body, Dvaita maintains radical ontological distinction between the unchanging Lord and all changing entities. The Lord's agency in creation involves no internal modification; His perfect knowledge and will suffice to generate and guide all cosmic becoming without any change in His essential nature.

Individual souls experience genuine transformation in their epistemological and ethical states while remaining ontologically dependent and essentially different from God. The soul's journey through samsara involves real change in knowledge, virtue, and spiritual realization, yet the soul never becomes God nor merges into divine being. Liberation itself represents transformation of the soul's condition—from ignorance to knowledge, from bondage to freedom—not transformation of the soul's essential nature as eternally distinct from and dependent upon Vishnu.

The doctrine of taratamya (gradation) orders all souls in an eternal hierarchy that admits no ultimate equalization. Even in liberation, souls retain individual distinctions and experience transformation in their progressive realization of divine attributes. Devotional practice (bhakti) cultivates this genuine spiritual development, transforming the devotee's consciousness while maintaining the eternal master-servant relationship with the Lord. Change thus serves divine purpose: demonstrating God's sovereignty, manifesting His glory, and enabling souls to evolve toward their eternally subordinate yet blissful destiny in devotional service.

*** 1.9.94 Kashmir Shaivism Response

Change represents the dynamic play of consciousness (Spanda) as it freely manifests the universe through its inherent power of self-awareness and creative bliss, with all becoming expressing the divine freedom (svatantrya) of Shiva's spontaneous self-recognition. Kashmir Shaivism transcends static conceptions of unchanging reality, recognizing that the Supreme Consciousness (Paramashiva) is eternally vibrant, pulsating with creative dynamism while remaining essentially identical with itself throughout all transformations. Change is not opposed to the absolute but constitutes its very nature as prakasha-vimarsha (light and reflective awareness).

The concept of Spanda explains how consciousness undergoes ceaseless vibration without departing from its essential unity. This sacred tremor generates all phenomenal appearances while the divine consciousness remains wholly itself in every modification. Unlike systems that regard change as either illusory or as affecting only a lower nature, Kashmir Shaivism celebrates becoming as the Lord's joyful self-expression. The thirty-six tattvas (principles) unfold from Shiva-tattva downward, each representing a progressive contraction of divine consciousness, yet none essentially different from the original unity.

Becoming occurs through the Lord's five cosmic acts (pancakritya): creation (srishti), maintenance (sthiti), dissolution (samhara), concealment (tirobhava), and grace (anugraha). These activities express Shiva's freedom to manifest, sustain, withdraw, veil, and reveal the universe in endless cycles. The doctrine of abhasavada (theory of reflection) explains how infinite consciousness projects all finite appearances within itself without undergoing real division or limitation, much as a mirror reflects countless images while remaining unaffected.

Spiritual practice involves recognizing one's own consciousness as identical with this divine dynamism. Through practices like pranayama, mantra recitation, and contemplation on Spanda, the practitioner awakens to the vibrant pulsation underlying all change. This realization does not negate becoming but transfigures it, revealing every transformation as Shiva's dance. Liberation (moksha) means resting in one's true nature as the unchanging-yet-ever-changing consciousness that freely generates all worlds while remaining eternally established in blissful self-awareness, recognizing that Shiva, Shakti, and the universe constitute one unified reality expressing itself through infinite becoming.

*** 1.9.95 Yoga Response

Change characterizes the transformations of prakrti (material nature) governed by the three gunas, while purusha (consciousness) remains eternally immutable, with yogic practice enabling discrimination between changing phenomena and the changeless witness. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras present becoming as the continuous modification (vritti) of citta (mind-stuff), whose fluctuations obscure the true nature of the Self until stilled through systematic practice. The famous opening sutra defines yoga as "chitta-vritti-nirodha"—the cessation of mental modifications—indicating that spiritual realization requires transcending the realm of change.

All phenomenal becoming belongs to the domain of prakriti, which evolves through real transformation (parinama) from its unmanifest state into the manifest universe of individual minds, senses, and material objects. The twenty-four tattvas of Samkhya cosmology describe this process of cosmic evolution, each principle emerging from previous ones through genuine modification. Individual consciousness experiences constant becoming through the five kleshas (afflictions): ignorance (avidya), ego (asmita), attachment (raga), aversion (dvesha), and fear of death (abhinivesha), which generate endless cycles of mental transformation and karmic conditioning.

The practice of eight-limbed yoga (ashtanga) addresses change at multiple levels. Yamas and niyamas cultivate ethical transformation; asana stabilizes the physical body's fluctuations; pranayama regulates breath's changing rhythms; pratyahara withdraws attention from sensory modifications; dharana fixes concentration; dhyana maintains meditative flow; and samadhi achieves absorption beyond all change. Each stage represents progressive mastery over increasingly subtle forms of becoming, culminating in kaivalya (isolation) where consciousness recognizes its complete distinction from all transformation.

The concept of samskara explains how past actions create deep impressions that drive future becoming, forming chains of cause and effect across lifetimes. These subconscious tendencies continuously modify consciousness until exhausted through yoga. Yet even as the practitioner works systematically with change—transforming ignorance into knowledge, distraction into focus, suffering into peace—the ultimate goal is recognizing purusha's eternal changelessness. The paradox of yoga: using change to transcend change, recognizing that one's true nature has never actually been touched by the endless modifications of prakrti.

*** 1.9.96 Samkhya Response

Change constitutes the real transformation of prakrti through the interplay of three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), while purusha remains absolutely immutable, with all becoming representing evolutionary and involutionary movements of material nature that consciousness witnesses but never undergoes. The Samkhya system provides the most detailed analysis of cosmic becoming in Indian philosophy, describing how prakrti evolves from unmanifest equilibrium into the manifest universe through necessary stages dictated by the gunas' inherent dynamics.

In the state of prakriti-laya (material equilibrium), the three gunas exist in perfect balance, producing no manifest becoming. When disturbed by the mere presence of purusha, this equilibrium breaks, initiating creation through genuine transformation (parinama). Unlike illusionist philosophies, Samkhya affirms change as real modification of actual substance. The first product is mahat or buddhi (cosmic intelligence), followed by ahamkara (ego-principle), then the five tanmatras (subtle elements), five mahabhutas (gross elements), eleven indriyas (senses), and manas (mind)—twenty-four tattvas in total, all representing real transformations of the original prakrti.

Individual becoming follows this cosmic pattern through embodiment and reembodiment. The subtle body (linga-sharira) carries karmic samskaras through death and rebirth, undergoing continuous transformation according to the law of karma. Each life represents a unique configuration of gunas producing specific physical, mental, and experiential changes. Suffering arises from identifying purusha (changeless consciousness) with these modifications of prakrti, mistaking the body's transformations, mind's fluctuations, and ego's developments as affecting the true Self.

Liberation (kaivalya) is achieved through perfect discrimination (viveka) between purusha and prakrti, recognizing that all becoming belongs exclusively to material nature. This knowledge does not halt prakrti's transformations but severs consciousness's false identification with them. The liberated purusha rests in its eternal immutability, recognizing that birth, aging, death, pleasure, pain, knowledge, and ignorance all represent modifications of prakrti that never touch the essential Self. Even after liberation, the body-mind complex continues its changes until the momentum of past karma exhausts itself, but the realized consciousness remains unaffected, witnessing becoming without participation or attachment, eternally free from change's domain.

*** 1.9.97 Nyaya Response

Change represents real transformation requiring adequate causation and conforming to universal principles of logic and natural law, with all becoming subject to rational analysis through perception, inference, comparison, and testimony. The Nyaya system approaches change through rigorous logical methodology, rejecting both extreme eternalism and extreme momentariness in favor of qualified transformation theory. Objects undergo genuine modification while maintaining identity through time, requiring careful analysis to distinguish between substantial change (affecting dravya or substance) and qualitative change (affecting guna or quality).

The Nyaya-Vaisheshika synthesis explains becoming through the category of karma (action), which along with dravya (substance) and guna (quality) constitutes the three primary categories of reality. Action produces conjunction and disjunction of substances, generating observable change in the physical world. The five types of motion—upward (ut-kshepana), downward (ava-kshepana), contraction (akunchana), expansion (prasarana), and locomotion (gamana)—account for all physical becoming, each requiring adequate efficient causation traceable through empirical observation.

Causation (karana) provides the fundamental framework for understanding change. The Nyaya system identifies three types of causes: inherent cause (samavayi-karana), non-inherent cause (asamavayi-karana), and efficient cause (nimitta-karana). All genuine becoming requires this threefold causation operating according to invariable natural laws. The thread's existence requires cotton (inherent cause), the cotton's configuration requires weaving motion (efficient cause), and the thread's qualities require cotton's prior qualities (non-inherent cause). This analysis prevents magical thinking and superstitious explanations of transformation.

Logical principles govern proper understanding of change. The law of non-contradiction ensures that contradictory properties cannot simultaneously characterize the same object in the same respect, while the law of causation guarantees that every effect has adequate antecedent conditions. Inference (anumana) allows knowledge of unobserved changes through invariable concomitance (vyapti), as fire's existence is inferred from smoke through established causal relationship. Memory and recognition prove that objects persist through change, maintaining identity despite modification—the same person aged is numerically identical to their younger self, despite qualitative transformation. Through systematic logical analysis, Nyaya philosophy provides rigorous epistemological foundations for understanding becoming's nature, causes, and knowability.

*** 1.9.98 Vaisheshika Response

Change occurs through real transformation of atomic substances (anu) governed by seven fundamental categories of existence, with all becoming explicable through combinations and separations of eternal atoms following natural laws discoverable through perception and inference. The Vaisheshika system offers the most thoroughly developed atomic theory in classical Indian philosophy, explaining cosmic and individual becoming through the mechanics of ultimate particles that themselves remain qualitatively unchanging.

The seven categories (padartha)—substance (dravya), quality (guna), action (karma), universal (samanya), particularity (vishesha), inherence (samavaya), and non-existence (abhava)—provide the comprehensive ontological framework for analyzing all change. Substance undergoes modification through gain or loss of qualities and through spatial reconfiguration via action. The nine substances include earth, water, fire, air, ether, time, space, soul, and mind, each exhibiting characteristic patterns of becoming determined by inherent nature and external causation.

Atomic becoming follows specific principles: atoms themselves are eternal and partless, never created or destroyed, but undergo endless combinations producing composite objects subject to creation and destruction. Two atoms form a dyad (dvyanuka), three dyads form a triad (tryanuka), and increasingly complex combinations generate all perceived objects. Change occurs when atomic configurations break apart and recombine, explaining how gross objects arise and perish while ultimate constituents remain eternal. This resolves the paradox of becoming: genuine creation and destruction at the composite level without violating the principle that being cannot come from non-being.

The concept of samyoga (conjunction) and vibhaga (disjunction) explains mechanical causation. All physical change reduces to atoms coming together or separating through motion imparted by previous configurations, unseen force (adrishta), or divine will. Chemical transformation, biological growth, mental modification—all ultimately trace to atomic rearrangement following deterministic natural laws. Even consciousness, though itself immaterial and eternal, manifests various states through conjunction with differently configured material bodies and sense organs.

This atomistic framework demystifies becoming while preserving both continuity and genuine transformation, eternal substances and temporal phenomena, mechanistic explanation and teleological purpose fulfilled through Ishvara's providential governance of natural law.

*** 1.9.99 Mimamsa Response

Change represents real transformation within the eternal cosmos ordered by dharma, with all becoming governed by the autonomous law of karma and ritual causation, requiring no divine intervention but operating according to apurva (unseen potency) generated by prescribed Vedic actions. The Mimamsa system affirms both the reality of change and the eternity of the world, rejecting creation ex nihilo in favor of beginningless cycles of cosmic manifestation and dissolution where transformation follows eternal patterns established by Vedic injunctions.

Becoming manifests primarily through kriya (ritual action) that generates apurva—an invisible power that bridges the temporal gap between sacrifice and its future result. When a person performs agnihotra or other Vedic rites, immediate physical changes occur (wood burns, ghee melts, mantras sound), but these visible transformations generate subtle karmic potencies that persist until maturity produces their proper effects. This explains how actions produce results separated by time, how cause and effect connect across temporal intervals, and how moral and ritual causation operate independently of divine will.

The Mimamsa position on causation emphasizes svatah-pramanya (intrinsic validity) and arthapatti (postulation) to understand becoming. Knowledge arises validly unless contradicted, and unobserved entities must be postulated when necessary to explain observed effects. Apurva is thus postulated to explain how sacrifices generate heaven or other results not immediately apparent. All change follows eternal laws embedded in Vedic prescriptions, which neither require nor permit divine legislation—the Veda itself is eternal (nitya) and authorless (apaurusheya), expressing timeless dharmic principles.

Individual transformation occurs through progressive accumulation and exhaustion of karmic residues generated by action conforming to or violating Vedic injunctions. Birth, death, prosperity, adversity—all represent natural consequences of previous actions operating through autonomous causal mechanisms. Liberation (moksha) itself constitutes transformation from embodied existence to the soul's permanent cessation of rebirth, achieved not through divine grace but through perfect fulfillment of obligatory rites and exhaustion of karmic accumulation. Change thus serves dharmic purpose: enabling souls to exhaust karma through ritual participation in the eternal cosmic order.

*** 1.9.100 Mahayana Response

Change represents the empty, interdependent arising of phenomena devoid of inherent existence, with all becoming emerging from the union of wisdom and compassion manifesting as skillful means to liberate beings trapped in samsara's endless transformations. The Mahayana tradition radically reframes becoming through the doctrine of shunyata (emptiness), revealing that change itself lacks self-nature—neither existing substantially nor not-existing absolutely. All transformation occurs within the non-dual dharmadhatu (reality-sphere) where wisdom (prajna) and compassion (karuna) eternally interpenetrate.

The Heart Sutra's profound teaching—"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form"—dissolves rigid distinctions between being and becoming, permanence and change, nirvana and samsara. Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka analysis demonstrates through prasanga (reductio ad absurdum) that change cannot be established through inherent existence: if things possessed fixed nature, they could not change; yet if they lacked all existence, there would be nothing to undergo transformation. Therefore, becoming occurs conventionally (samvriti-satya) while remaining empty of ultimate reality (paramartha-satya), functioning without fixed essence through pratitya-samutpada (dependent origination).

Bodhisattva practice embraces becoming as the field of compassionate activity. Rather than seeking escape from change into static nirvana, Mahayana practitioners generate bodhicitta (awakening mind) and vow to remain in samsara until all beings achieve liberation. This requires mastery of upaya-kaushalya (skillful means)—adapting teaching and practice to beings' varying capacities and circumstances. The Lotus Sutra presents the eternal Buddha who manifests birth, enlightenment, and parinirvana as pedagogical devices, revealing that ultimate reality transcends both being and becoming while embracing both.

The Tathagatagarbha doctrine adds further dimension: all beings possess Buddha-nature, making transformation toward enlightenment not creation of something new but recognition of always-present awakened nature obscured by adventitious defilements. Change thus serves soteriological purpose—enabling progressive purification until original enlightenment shines forth. The Mahayana path cultivates paramitas (perfections) through endless bodhisattva lifetimes, transforming ignorance into wisdom, grasping into generosity, hatred into patience, recognizing that this very transformation is itself empty, neither adding to nor subtracting from the unchanging dharmadhatu.

*** 1.9.101 Theravada Response

Change (anicca) constitutes the fundamental characteristic of all conditioned phenomena, with every arising inevitably subject to cessation according to the law of dependent origination, requiring meditative insight to transcend attachment to impermanent formations. The Buddha's teaching in the Pali Canon identifies three marks of existence (tilakkhana): impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). Understanding becoming's nature is essential to liberation, for clinging to changing phenomena generates suffering that binds beings to samsara.

All compounded things (sankhara) undergo continuous transformation through the five aggregates (pancakkhandha): material form (rupa), feeling (vedana), perception (sanna), mental formations (sankhara), and consciousness (vinnana). These aggregates arise and cease moment-by-moment, with no permanent self enduring through change. What appears as stable identity is actually a causal continuum—each moment's aggregates conditioning the next through dependent origination (paticca-samuppada) without any substantial entity migrating through time. Birth, aging, death, pleasure, pain—all represent temporary configurations of the five aggregates following karmic causation.

The Abhidhamma provides detailed analysis of becoming at the subtlest level. Ultimate reality (paramattha-dhamma) consists of dharmas (momentary mental and material events) arising and ceasing with extraordinary rapidity. Each consciousness moment (citta) endures only for an instant, followed immediately by the next in causal sequence. Physical matter (rupa-kalapa) similarly flashes in and out of existence in infinitesimal temporal units. This radical impermanence means nothing actually "becomes"—there are only momentary arisings and ceasings creating the conventional illusion of continuity and transformation.

Vipassana meditation cultivates direct insight into anicca through systematic observation of breath, bodily sensations, feelings, and mental states. As concentration deepens, the practitioner directly perceives the constant flux underlying apparent stability, experiencing the dissolution of all formations. This insight generates samvega (spiritual urgency) and leads to nibbana (nirvana), the unconditioned reality beyond all becoming. Liberation does not involve transformation into some new state but cessation (nirodha) of the ignorance and craving that drive endless becoming, revealing the deathless (amata) that neither arises nor ceases, permanently transcending change's domain.

*** 1.9.102 Vajrayana Response

Change manifests as the dance of emptiness and luminosity, with all becoming expressing the union of wisdom and skillful means accessible through tantric practice that transforms ordinary experience into enlightened awareness within this very lifetime. Vajrayana transcends gradual path models by recognizing that samsara and nirvana are non-dual—change itself is the display of primordial purity (ka-dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun-grub), requiring only recognition rather than transformation into something other.

The tantric view embraces becoming as the dynamic energy (shakti) of enlightened awareness manifesting the five Buddha families, each representing the transformation of a poison into wisdom: delusion into dharmadhatu wisdom, anger into mirror-like wisdom, pride into equalizing wisdom, desire into discriminating wisdom, and jealousy into all-accomplishing wisdom. Rather than rejecting or transcending the emotions and energies that drive change, Vajrayana transmutes them directly into awakened qualities through deity yoga, mantra recitation, and tantric empowerment.

The doctrine of the three kayas (bodies) explains becoming's ultimate nature. The dharmakaya (truth body) remains forever unchanging, empty, and luminous; the sambhogakaya (enjoyment body) manifests subtle transformations perceptible to advanced practitioners; the nirmanakaya (emanation body) appears in gross material form subject to birth, aging, and death. These three bodies are inseparable—every moment of change simultaneously expresses all three dimensions. Ordinary beings perceive only nirmanakaya's transformations; tantric practitioners recognize sambhogakaya's pure displays; realized masters rest in dharmakaya's unchanging nature while engaging fully with becoming.

Completion stage practices (sampannakrama) work directly with the subtle body's channels, winds, and drops to transform ordinary becoming into enlightened display. Through tummo (inner heat), prana (vital energy) is guided into the central channel, dissolving ordinary dualistic consciousness and revealing clear light nature. The Mahamudra and Dzogchen teachings represent the pinnacle: recognizing rigpa (pure awareness) as already present, requiring no transformation—all change occurs within the boundless expanse of awareness that itself never wavers from its self-knowing luminosity, making enlightenment possible in this very body, through these very experiences, transforming becoming itself into liberation's display.

*** 1.9.103 Zen Response

Change flows naturally when the discriminating mind ceases its grasping, with all becoming revealed as the seamless movement of Buddha-nature requiring neither affirmation nor negation, only direct realization through zazen and sudden awakening to original mind. Zen transcends philosophical analysis of transformation, pointing directly to mind's true nature beyond concepts of being and becoming, permanence and change, creation and destruction. The famous koan "What was your original face before your parents were born?" cuts through temporal categories to reveal timeless awareness manifesting all change.

Dogen's teaching of shinjin-datsuraku (dropping off body-mind) liberates practitioners from false dualities between changing phenomena and unchanging essence. His doctrine of uji (being-time) reveals that time is being and being is time—each moment stands complete and whole, with past, present, and future interpenetrating without linear succession. Mountains walking, rivers preaching dharma, bamboo shadows sweeping stairs without raising dust—these images express becoming's true nature when freed from conceptual overlay. Practice-enlightenment (shushō-ittō) means transformation and realization occur simultaneously, not sequentially.

The Rinzai emphasis on kensho (seeing one's nature) through intense koan practice catalyzes sudden breakthrough beyond all conceptual understanding of change. When the rational mind exhausts itself confronting "mu" or "the sound of one hand," ordinary consciousness collapses, revealing vast emptiness (shunyata) that neither exists nor doesn't exist, neither changes nor remains static. This breakthrough doesn't create something new but recognizes what has always been present—Buddha-nature never obscured despite appearances of becoming.

Daily activity embodies this realization: "Chop wood, carry water"—before enlightenment and after enlightenment, the same activities continue, yet utterly transformed. Change no longer appears as problem requiring transcendence or as illusion requiring denial. Mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers, precisely as they are, neither static nor impermanent in any reified sense. The great matter of birth and death resolves not through metaphysical understanding but through sitting shikantaza (just sitting), allowing thoughts to rise and fall like clouds across the sky of mind, which itself neither comes into being nor passes away, even as all appearances continuously transform within its boundless luminosity.

*** 1.9.104 Pure Land Response

Change characterizes this defiled Saha world of suffering where beings undergo endless cycles of birth and death, resolved through faith in Amida Buddha's vows that transform evil karma into birth in the Pure Land where progress toward enlightenment becomes irreversible. The Pure Land tradition recognizes the reality of becoming in this world while orienting practice toward birth in Sukhavati (Land of Bliss), where transformation occurs under ideal conditions free from regression or obstruction.

This corrupt kaliyuga age prevents most beings from achieving liberation through self-power (jiriki) practices that require eons of gradual transformation. The five defilements intensify: age becomes more troubled, views more distorted, passions more virulent, beings more degenerate, life more shortened. In such conditions, attempting to transform oneself through meditation, virtue, or wisdom is like trying to navigate by land when one has already fallen into a violent ocean. The current of karma sweeps beings helplessly through endless becomings in the six realms of samsara.

Amida Buddha's forty-eight vows, particularly the eighteenth (Primal Vow), provide the sole effective means of transformation in this age. Through sincere recitation of nembutsu—"Namu Amida Butsu"—practitioners entrust themselves completely to other-power (tariki), allowing Amida's infinite compassion and merit to accomplish what self-power cannot. This faith itself represents shinjin (true entrusting heart) granted by Amida, not achieved through personal effort. At death, Amida appears with attendant bodhisattvas to guide the practitioner to birth in Pure Land.

Once born in Sukhavati through Amida's transformative grace, change occurs optimally. The Pure Land's environment—jeweled trees, fragrant breezes, melodious birds teaching dharma—naturally inspires spiritual development. Practitioners advance through nine grades according to their attainment in this life, progressing irreversibly toward Buddhahood. The greatest transformation happens at life's end: instantaneous transition from this world of suffering to the Pure Land of bliss, accomplished not through personal merit but through complete reliance on Amida's power, making liberation accessible to even the most karmic-burdened beings through grateful recitation and unwavering faith.

*** 1.9.105 Madhyamaka Response

Change lacks inherent existence, neither truly occurring nor truly not-occurring, with all becoming emerging dependently without self-nature, requiring realization of emptiness (shunyata) beyond all conceptual extremes to liberate beings from substantialist views of transformation. Nagarjuna's revolutionary analysis in the Mulamadhyamakakarika systematically deconstructs conventional notions of becoming, demonstrating through prasanga (reductio ad absurdum) that change cannot withstand logical analysis from the ultimate standpoint while functioning perfectly at the conventional level.

The famous tetralemma (chatuskoti) applied to becoming eliminates all possible positions: things neither arise from themselves, from others, from both, nor without cause. If existing things arose from themselves, they would arise redundantly; if from something utterly other, anything could arise from anything; if from both, the previous problems combine; if causelessly, chaos would reign. Therefore, arising lacks svabhava (intrinsic nature), occurring only conventionally through pratitya-samutpada (dependent origination). This doesn't mean nothing happens—rather, change functions precisely because it lacks fixed essence.

The distinction between two truths (satya-dvaya) clarifies becoming's status. Conventionally (samvriti-satya), transformation occurs validly: seeds grow into plants, children mature into adults, ignorance transforms into wisdom. These processes follow dependable causal patterns suitable for practical engagement and soteriological endeavor. Ultimately (paramartha-satya), however, all these becomings are empty of inherent existence—neither real nor unreal, neither existent nor non-existent, neither permanent nor impermanent in any absolute sense. This non-dual middle way (madhyama-pratipad) avoids both eternalism and nihilism.

Understanding emptiness of becoming liberates practitioners from clinging and aversion that perpetuate suffering. When change is seen as neither ultimately real nor ultimately unreal, the grasping mind releases its grip. This doesn't produce apathy but enables genuine compassion—recognizing all beings trapped by reified views of transformation, the bodhisattva works tirelessly to liberate them while knowing that ultimately no beings exist to be liberated, no path to traverse, no enlightenment to achieve. This profound insight, neither affirming nor denying becoming, represents perfect wisdom (prajnaparamita) that sees reality exactly as it is: dependently arisen, empty, luminous, beyond all conceptual elaboration yet manifesting conventional transformation without contradiction.

*** 1.9.106 Yogacara Response

Change occurs within consciousness itself as the transformation of the alaya-vijnana (storehouse consciousness) containing all karmic seeds (bijas) that mature into manifest experience, with external objects being mere projections requiring realization that all becoming is mind-only (cittamatra). The Yogacara school provides the most sophisticated analysis of consciousness and its transformations in Buddhist philosophy, explaining all apparent change as internal to awareness rather than involving independently existing material objects.

The eight consciousness doctrine details becoming's mechanism. The first five consciousnesses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) undergo continuous transformation as sense objects appear and vanish. The sixth (manas or conceptual mind) integrates sensory data into coherent experience while generating discursive thought. The seventh (klishta-manas or afflicted mind) maintains continuous self-grasping that drives samsaric becoming. The eighth (alaya-vijnana or storehouse consciousness) functions as a vast repository containing karmic seeds that ripen according to conditions, producing both the seeming external world and internal mental states.

Transformation (parinama) operates through three modes: maturation (vipaka), whereby past actions ripen into present experience; conceptualization (manana), whereby manas perpetually constructs self-sense; and perception (vijnapti), whereby consciousness manifests as objects. What appears as external change—seasons shifting, bodies aging, societies evolving—actually represents consciousness transforming its own contents. The seed produces the sprout, the sprout the mature plant, the plant the fruit; yet seed, sprout, plant, and fruit all occur as transformations within consciousness, not as independently existing material substances.

Liberation requires paravritti (turning about in the deepest seat of consciousness)—fundamental transformation of the alaya-vijnana through cultivation of correct understanding. As practitioners progress through stages (bhumis), afflicted consciousness gradually purifies until, at enlightenment, the eight consciousnesses transform into four wisdoms (jnanas): mirror-like wisdom, equality wisdom, observing wisdom, and accomplishing wisdom. This radical transformation doesn't eliminate consciousness but purifies it from ignorance and defilement. The enlightened being's awareness continues manifesting appearances, but without grasping or delusion—becoming continues as luminous display of wisdom, no longer binding consciousness to suffering's endless cycle.

*** 1.9.107 Tibetan Buddhism Response

Change manifests as the inseparable display of clarity and emptiness within the union of samsara and nirvana, with all becoming recognized through Vajrayana practice, Madhyamaka philosophy, and Mahayana compassion as the spontaneous expression of Buddha-nature requiring guru-guided transformation of this very body into enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhism synthesizes Indian Buddhist traditions into a comprehensive path addressing becoming at multiple levels—philosophical analysis through Madhyamaka, consciousness transformation through Yogacara, tantric transmutation through Vajrayana, and practical ethics through Mahayana bodhisattva vows.

The Lamrim (graduated path) presents becoming as both obstacle and opportunity. Preliminaries contemplate precious human birth's impermanence, motivating diligent practice before death's inevitable change occurs. Recognizing suffering pervading all conditioned existence (samsara's endless becoming) generates renunciation. Understanding that all sentient beings have been one's mother in previous lives—undergoing countless transformations through the six realms—cultivates universal compassion. These contemplations transform ordinary motivation into bodhicitta, the altruistic intention to achieve enlightenment for all beings' benefit.

The four philosophical schools (tenets) are studied progressively to refine understanding of becoming's ultimate nature. Vaibhashika and Sautrantika explain conventional transformation through substantially existing atoms or momentary particulars. Cittamatra reveals all change as consciousness-only. Madhyamaka Prasangika establishes the definitive view: all becoming is empty of inherent existence yet functions conventionally through dependent origination. This view prevents both eternalism (believing change affects truly existing substances) and nihilism (denying conventional causation operates reliably).

Tantric practice accelerates transformation through deity yoga, visualizing oneself as fully enlightened Buddha manifesting pure land mandala. This "bringing the result into the path" transforms ordinary perception into pure vision, ordinary aggregates into five Buddha families, ordinary environments into celestial palaces. The completion stage practices with channels, winds, and drops dissolve gross consciousness into clear light nature, realizing the inseparability of bliss and emptiness. Dzogchen represents the culmination: recognizing rigpa (primordial awareness) as always already present, requiring no transformation—all becoming spontaneously self-liberates upon recognition, like drawings dissolving on water's surface, leaving awareness uncontaminated and luminous, changeless yet manifesting all change through its infinite creative display.

*** 1.9.108 Thai Forest Response

Change permeates all conditioned phenomena without exception, requiring sustained mindfulness and investigation of arising and passing to realize the deathless unconditioned beyond all becoming, cultivated through strict monastic discipline and intensive meditation in remote forest environments. The Thai Forest tradition emphasizes direct experiential understanding of anicca (impermanence) through rigorous practice following the Buddha's original teaching preserved in Pali Canon, rejecting philosophical speculation in favor of meditative realization.

Ajahn Maha Boowa taught that investigating the mind's changing nature through relentless inner examination reveals consciousness's ultimate character. Practitioners observe thoughts arising and ceasing, moods shifting, intentions forming and dissolving—all without any permanent entity experiencing these transformations. The five aggregates continuously arise and pass: body sensations change moment-to-moment, feelings alternate between pleasant, painful, and neutral, perceptions form and fade, mental formations flash into and out of existence, consciousness itself arises dependently on objects without abiding self-nature.

The meditation practice focuses intensively on death contemplation (maranassati) and body investigation, making impermanence visceral rather than conceptual. Charnel ground meditation observes corpses in various stages of decay—bloated, discolored, dismembered, skeletal—confronting the brutal reality of bodily transformation. This investigation extends to one's own body: hair, nails, teeth, skin, all arising from elements and returning to elements, maintaining no permanent identity. Ajahn Chah emphasized: "If you let go a little, you have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you have complete peace."

The path requires relinquishing attachment to all changing phenomena through eight-fold noble path practice. Right view understands becoming's unsatisfactory and selfless nature; right intention renounces sensual craving driving rebirth; right speech, action, and livelihood minimize karmic accumulation; right effort, mindfulness, and concentration develop mind capable of penetrating reality directly. Through vipassana (insight meditation), practitioners witness aggregates' dissolution at increasingly subtle levels until penetrating cessation (nirodha), the unconditioned (asankhata) nibbana beyond all arising and passing. This realization doesn't eliminate change but liberates consciousness from identifying with or clinging to transformation's endless display.

*** 1.9.109 Nichiren Response

Change operates through the Mystic Law (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) pervading all existence, with every transformation governed by the Lotus Sutra's eternal truth that enables individuals to revolutionize their karma and manifest Buddhahood in this present existence through devoted practice. Nichiren Buddhism emphasizes human revolution—the profound transformation of individual life condition that ripples outward to transform family, society, and ultimately world peace, achieved through faith, practice, and study of Nichiren Daishonin's teaching.

The concept of ichinen sanzen (three thousand realms in a single moment) reveals that every instant contains all possible life states, from hell to Buddhahood. Change occurs through which of the ten worlds predominates in consciousness: hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, or Buddhahood. Most people fluctuate among the lower six worlds, driven by external circumstances producing reactive transformations. Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and studying Nichiren's writings, practitioners develop the higher four worlds—particularly the bodhisattva and Buddha states—achieving lasting transformation of life condition.

The doctrine of esho funi (oneness of life and environment) explains how individual transformation necessarily produces environmental change. Subject and object are non-dual; when inner life condition elevates through practice, external circumstances transform correspondingly. This revolutionary teaching empowers practitioners to change their destiny (karma) through changing their fundamental life state, rather than passively accepting karmic inheritance or requiring divine intervention. The Gohonzon (object of devotion) functions as mirror reflecting one's Buddha nature, enabling direct access to enlightenment through sincere practice.

Historical transformation also operates through the Mystic Law. Nichiren identified three periods of Buddhism: the Former Day of the Law (correct practice producing enlightenment), the Middle Day (formalistic practice losing efficacy), and the Latter Day of Mappo (utter corruption requiring new practice). In this degenerate age, only faith in the Lotus Sutra and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can produce human revolution and social transformation. Through shakubuku (refuting erroneous teachings and propagating correct dharma), practitioners transform society from the inside out, establishing lasting peace through individual enlightenment multiplied through kosen-rufu (worldwide propagation), making Buddhism's highest teaching accessible to all people regardless of capacity, enabling immediate transformation from suffering to joy through the power of the Mystic Law.

*** 1.9.110 Tendai Response

Change manifests through the interpenetration of all dharmas in mutual identity and mutual penetration, with all becoming expressing the perfect and sudden teaching that every phenomenon contains the entire dharma realm, requiring integrated practice of meditation, study, precepts, and esoteric ritual. The Tendai school synthesizes diverse Buddhist teachings into comprehensive understanding of becoming as the dynamic interplay of emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way unified in "three truths in one" (santai enyu).

The Lotus Sutra provides the philosophical foundation: all beings possess Buddha-nature and will eventually achieve enlightenment through innumerable skillful means adapted to varying capacities. The parable of the burning house illustrates how the Buddha manifests different vehicles—Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana—according to beings' conditions, all ultimately revealing the One Vehicle toward supreme enlightenment. Transformation thus occurs through pedagogy matched to student readiness, with provisional teachings serving as expedient means until beings mature sufficiently for ultimate truth.

Zhiyi's classification of teachings (panjiao) organizes the Buddha's lifetime instructions into five periods and eight teachings, showing progressive transformation in the Buddha's pedagogical method: from initial Avatamsaka teaching to final Lotus-Nirvana synthesis. This doesn't mean the Buddha changed—rather, beings' capacity to receive teaching gradually developed, requiring different methods at different stages. The perfect teaching reveals that transformation occurs in consciousness's relationship to reality, not in reality itself, which remains always complete, all-inclusive, interpenetrating.

The practice of shikan (samatha-vipassana) cultivates direct realization of ichinen sanzen—that each moment of consciousness contains three thousand realms arising from the ten worlds, ten suchnesses, and three realms of existence. This profound teaching means every instant contains infinite possibility: hell-dwellers can access Buddha-nature; enlightened beings can manifest in suffering to teach compassion. Change thus becomes not linear progress but dynamic manifestation of always-present totality. Through integrated practice combining Tendai meditation, Pure Land recitation, esoteric ritual, and Zen contemplation, practitioners realize that becoming and being, samsara and nirvana, delusion and enlightenment interpenetrate completely—each containing all, transforming without obstruction through the perfect, sudden, and complete dharma.

*** 1.9.111 Shingon Response

Change represents the dynamic expression of Mahavairocana Buddha's cosmic body pervading all existence, with every transformation constituting the three mysteries of body, speech, and mind through which practitioners achieve sokushin-jobutsu (becoming Buddha in this very body) via esoteric practice. Shingon Buddhism presents the most thoroughly developed esoteric system in East Asian Buddhism, understanding becoming as the visible manifestation of Dainichi Nyorai's (Mahavairocana's) compassionate activity throughout the dharma realm.

The doctrine of hosshin seppo (dharma-body preaches the law) reveals that ultimate reality actively teaches—not just through words but through every natural phenomenon and life event. Mountains, rivers, grasses, trees all manifest the dharma; their continuous transformation constitutes the cosmic Buddha's ongoing sermon. This differs from exoteric Buddhism's view that historical Shakyamuni alone preached dharma. In Shingon understanding, Shakyamuni was Mahavairocana's nirmanakaya manifestation; the ultimate dharmakaya continuously expresses itself through all becoming.

Transformation occurs through the six elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space, consciousness) that constitute both the cosmos and the practitioner's body-mind. These elements interpenetrate without obstruction, enabling communication between microcosm and macrocosm. Through sanmitsu practice (three mysteries: mudras harmonizing body, mantras harmonizing speech, visualization harmonizing mind), practitioners achieve resonance with Mahavairocana's cosmic activity. The distinction between unenlightened and enlightened, practitioner and Buddha, dissolves as one realizes the original non-duality—becoming Buddha doesn't require future transformation but recognizes present identity with dharmakaya.

The two mandalas—Womb World (Taizōkai) representing compassion and Matrix of original enlightenment, Diamond World (Kongōkai) representing wisdom and indestructible Buddha-nature—depict reality's complete structure through geometric symbolism. Transformation moves through these mandala stages: beings progress from periphery toward center as practice matures, yet simultaneously exist always-already at the center as Mahavairocana. The paradox resolves through understanding esoteric truth: all change occurs within enlightenment, not toward it. Through empowerment (abhisheka), mantra recitation, mudra formation, and mandala visualization, Shingon practitioners transform this very body into vajra-body, this very speech into mantra, this very mind into Buddha-mind, accomplishing in this lifetime what exoteric paths require three great aeons to achieve.

*** 1.9.112 Jodo Shinshu Response

Change characterizes this mappo age where beings' spiritual capacity has degenerated beyond self-transformation, requiring complete reliance on Amida Buddha's Primal Vow that transforms even the most karmic-burdened person through shinjin (true entrusting heart) received as pure gift rather than personal achievement. Shinran Shonin radicalized Pure Land teaching by eliminating all traces of self-power (jiriki), recognizing that even single nembutsu recitation originates from Amida's other-power (tariki) rather than practitioner effort, making transformation entirely gratuitous.

The doctrine of akunin shoki (evil person as primary object of salvation) inverts conventional religious logic: precisely because one is completely incapable of self-transformation through virtue, meditation, or wisdom, one becomes Amida's principal concern. The "good person" who relies on personal merit for salvation actually obstructs Amida's grace through self-power delusion; the "evil person" who recognizes complete spiritual bankruptcy becomes the perfect vessel for other-power to manifest. This radical teaching eliminates hierarchies based on moral or spiritual accomplishment, affirming that transformation occurs entirely through Amida's compassion, not through graduated self-improvement.

Shinjin itself—the true entrusting heart that enables birth in Pure Land—is not human faith generated through practice but Amida's own mind transferred to beings through the Primal Vow's operation. When one hears the Name (Nam-Amida-Butsu) and entrusts completely, this very entrustment is Amida's working, not personal achievement. The transformation thus occurs at the moment of shinjin, after which birth in Pure Land becomes settled (ichinen-hokki). Subsequent nembutsu recitation expresses grateful response (hōon) rather than merit-accumulating effort.

The concept of nishu jinshin (twofold deep faith) captures this transformation: profound recognition of oneself as utterly foolish being bound for hell through accumulated evil karma, simultaneously with profound faith that Amida's Vow embraces precisely such beings with absolute certainty. This paradoxical awareness—complete despair regarding self-power combined with complete confidence in other-power—constitutes authentic shinjin. Change from birth-death cycle to birth in Pure Land occurs not through gradual purification but through sudden reception of grace, transforming one's destiny from inevitable hell to assured enlightenment through no merit of one's own, only through Amida's inconceivable compassionate vow fulfilled through infinite past practice for all beings' benefit.

*** 1.9.113 Soka Gakkai Response

Change occurs fundamentally through human revolution—the transformation of individual life state that creates value (soka) through faith in the Mystic Law, study of Nichiren Buddhism, and shakubuku practice aimed at worldwide kosen-rufu and lasting peace. Soka Gakkai modernizes and democratizes Nichiren Buddhism, emphasizing practical transformation in daily life rather than abstract philosophical speculation, making Buddhism relevant to contemporary social engagement while preserving core doctrinal commitment to the Lotus Sutra and Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Human revolution means changing one's fundamental life tendency (karma) through Buddhist practice integrated with active life engagement. Unlike traditional monasticism requiring world-renunciation, Soka Gakkai affirms that family, work, and social responsibilities provide the exact context for manifesting Buddhahood. Daily gongyo (reciting lotus sutra portions) and daimoku (chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) transform life state from reactive to proactive, from victim-consciousness to value-creation, from despair to hope. This inner transformation necessarily produces external change—improved relationships, enhanced work performance, better health, financial stability—validating practice through tangible benefits.

The principle of "Buddhism is reason" emphasizes that transformation follows reliable cause-effect principles rather than miraculous intervention or devotional sentiment. Chanting produces effects through resonating with the Mystic Law pervading all existence; changing one's ichinen (life-moment) transforms the entire three thousand realms contained within it. This scientific approach to spirituality appeals to modern practitioners seeking verifiable results. The organization provides structure supporting individual practice through discussion meetings, study programs, and encouragement activities that sustain momentum through difficulties.

Ikeda Daisaku's emphasis on dialogue and humanism extends Buddhist transformation beyond personal benefit toward cultural, educational, and peace activities. Establishing Soka University, the Toda Institute for peace research, and conducting dialogues with global leaders applies Buddhist principles to civilizational transformation. The three founding presidents' lives exemplify human revolution at its finest: Makiguchi's martyrdom defending religious freedom, Toda's revelation in prison reconstructing Buddhism from principles, Ikeda's transformation from tuberculosis-stricken youth to global peace advocate. Through connecting individual practice with organizational mission and societal transformation, Soka Gakkai presents Buddhism as dynamic force for creating value, transforming suffering into growth, establishing peace through inner revolution multiplied across millions of practitioners working for humanity's flourishing.

*** 1.9.114 Confucianism Response

Change follows the natural patterns of Heaven (Tian) manifesting through seasons, generations, and moral cultivation, requiring harmony with cosmic order through ritual propriety (li), humaneness (ren), and continuous self-improvement toward sage wisdom. Confucius recognized becoming's inevitability—"The Master on the riverbank said: 'It passes on like this, day and night without ceasing'"—while emphasizing that human transformation should align with Heaven's mandate through ethical discipline rather than drift chaotically with circumstance or desire.

The concept of li captures both cosmic pattern and human ritual. Natural change follows orderly sequence: spring's growth, summer's flourishing, autumn's harvest, winter's rest, perpetually cycling. Human society should mirror this order through appropriate ceremonies marking life's transitions—birth, coming-of-age, marriage, death—and through daily ritual propriety governing relationships. The five cardinal relationships (ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger, friend-friend) provide stable framework within which individuals navigate life's changes without losing moral orientation. Becoming thus occurs within structure, preventing chaotic transformation while allowing development according to one's role.

Personal transformation requires tireless self-cultivation. The Analects record Confucius's own development: "At fifteen I set my heart on learning; at thirty I stood firm; at forty I had no doubts; at fifty I understood Heaven's mandate; at sixty my ear was attuned; at seventy I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing moral bounds." This trajectory from discipline to spontaneous virtue demonstrates that proper change involves progressive refinement of character until external rules become internal nature. Study of classical texts, practice of ritual, cultivation of music, and moral reflection gradually transform crude disposition into refined humanity.

The sage embodies change's perfection: responding appropriately to every situation without premeditation, like water flowing naturally to low places or fire rising naturally upward. This represents not rigid unchanging identity but perfected responsiveness—the highest form of becoming where action flows from deep moral intuition aligned with cosmic pattern. Social transformation follows individual cultivation: when rulers perfect themselves, subjects naturally transform; when families harmonize, society stabilizes; when ritual pervades daily life, civilization flourishes. Change thus serves Heaven's purpose when guided by wisdom, constrained by propriety, motivated by humaneness, continuously refined through learning until reaching the ultimate transformation: from mere human to exemplary sage whose very presence transforms others.

*** 1.9.115 Neo-Confucianism Response

Change manifests through li (principle) dynamically expressing itself through qi (material force), with all becoming following both the universal pattern inherent in Heaven's nature and individual cultivation of mind toward unity with Supreme Ultimate (Taiji) through investigation of things and extension of knowledge. Neo-Confucianism synthesizes classical Confucian ethics with Buddhist and Daoist metaphysics, creating comprehensive cosmology explaining becoming's ultimate source while preserving Confucian emphasis on moral transformation through rational investigation and self-discipline.

Zhou Dunyi's Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate depicts cosmogonic becoming: the Taiji generates yang and yin through movement and stillness; their interaction produces five phases (wood, fire, earth, metal, water); these combine forming myriad things. This process isn't temporal creation but logical derivation showing how multiplicity emerges from unity while remaining grounded in ultimate principle. Every particular thing contains both li (its essential pattern) and qi (its material constitution). Change occurs through qi's transformations while li remains constant—the principle of "tree-ness" never changes, yet individual trees grow, mature, and decay according to qi's fluctuations.

Zhu Xi systematized this metaphysics into practical method: gewu zhizhi (investigating things and extending knowledge). Comprehensive study of natural patterns, historical precedents, classical texts, and human relationships gradually reveals li operative in all domains. As understanding deepens, one's xin (mind-heart) transforms from obscured to clear, from selfish to impartial, from fragmented to unified. This intellectual-moral transformation constitutes the primary becoming humans should pursue. External circumstances change unpredictably, but through clarifying one's understanding of principle and refining one's response, one achieves inner stability amid external flux.

Wang Yangming challenged Zhu Xi's externalism, teaching that li exists within xin rather than requiring external investigation. The doctrine of liang zhi (innate knowing) affirms that moral knowledge is inherent, requiring only removal of selfish obscurations blocking its manifestation. Transformation thus occurs through zhixing heyi (unity of knowledge and action)—genuine moral understanding immediately produces corresponding conduct. Quiet sitting meditation and careful attention to thoughts purifies consciousness, allowing innate goodness to manifest spontaneously. Whether through Zhu Xi's objective investigation or Wang Yangming's subjective illumination, Neo-Confucianism addresses becoming primarily as moral-intellectual transformation through which individuals realize their essential identity with universal principle, bringing mind into harmony with Heaven, manifesting sage virtues naturally rather than artificially, responding to circumstances appropriately because one's nature has been restored to original clarity and goodness.

*** 1.9.116 New Confucianism Response

Change represents the dynamic creativity of life itself continuously generating new values while preserving cultural essence, requiring synthesis of traditional Confucian wisdom with modern democratic, scientific, and pluralistic understanding to transform Chinese civilization and contribute to global human flourishing. New Confucianism (contemporary period, 20th-21st centuries) responds to modernity's challenges—Western imperialism, communist revolution, technological transformation, globalization—by reconstructing Confucian philosophy as living tradition capable of guiding contemporary change while remaining rooted in classical sources.

Mou Zongsan developed sophisticated metaphysics of moral creativity, arguing that Confucian ethics implies ontological foundation in a dynamic reality constantly generating new possibilities through human moral action. Unlike Neo-Confucian li-qi dualism, Mou presents nondual creative spontaneity (wuxing) underlying all becoming. Human nature participates directly in this cosmic creativity through liangzhi (moral consciousness), making ethical transformation not mere psychological change but participation in Heaven's own creative activity. This rehabilitates Confucian metaphysics against Western and Buddhist criticism while remaining faithful to Mencius's teaching on innate goodness.

Tu Weiming emphasizes embodied knowing and fiduciary community, presenting Confucian self-cultivation as transformation through relationship rather than isolated individual achievement. The process of becoming fully human requires participating in overlapping communities—family, society, nature, Heaven—each demanding appropriate responsiveness. Globalization necessitates expanding Confucian humanism beyond Chinese cultural boundaries toward genuine universalism respecting diversity. Ecological crisis requires recovering Confucian sense of cosmic belonging where human transformation intertwines with natural flourishing.

The project addresses political transformation: can Confucianism support democracy, human rights, gender equality? Conservative critics charge that modernization betrays tradition; progressive critics argue Confucianism is inherently authoritarian. New Confucians navigate this tension by distinguishing cultural essence (emphasis on learning, ritual, family, moral cultivation) from historically contingent forms (imperial bureaucracy, patriarchy, aristocratic privilege). They argue that Confucian values can transform modern institutions just as modern contexts transform Confucian expression. The result: a living tradition neither frozen in past forms nor dissolved into Western liberalism, but creative engagement where traditional wisdom and contemporary challenges mutually transform each other, generating new possibilities for human becoming individually, culturally, and globally.

*** 1.9.117 Daoism Response

Change flows naturally through the Dao's spontaneous movement, with all becoming emerging and returning according to wu wei (non-action) that accomplishes everything by not forcing, requiring alignment with natural patterns rather than artificial interference that disrupts original simplicity. The Daodejing opens declaring that the Dao that can be named is not the eternal Dao—ultimate reality transcends static concepts, operating through continuous transformation that words cannot capture. Yet paradoxically, understanding change's nature enables effortless action (wu wei) that harmonizes with universal flow.

The fundamental principle states: "Reversal is the movement of the Dao" (fan zhe dao zhi dong). All becoming follows cyclical patterns—fullness leads to emptiness, ascent to descent, expansion to contraction. The wise person recognizes these inevitable reversals and positions themselves accordingly: "Bend and remain whole; curl and remain straight; hollow out and fill up; wear out and renew; have little and gain; have much and be confused." Fighting natural transformation produces exhaustion and defeat; flowing with change requires minimal effort while achieving maximum effect.

Natural metaphors illuminate proper becoming: water seeks low places without forcing, eventually wearing away hardest stone through gentle persistence; trees bend in wind rather than breaking through rigid resistance; valleys receive all streams without grasping or rejecting. The sage embodies these qualities: responding spontaneously to circumstances without premeditation or attachment, acting when action fits the moment and desisting when forcing would violate natural timing. This differs from Confucian cultivation requiring constant moral effort—Daoist transformation happens naturally when artificial constraints dissolve.

The Zhuangzi develops this teaching through paradoxical stories: Butcher Ding cutting oxen effortlessly because his dao (skill/way) perceives spaces between joints; the useless tree surviving because its twisted wood serves no purpose; the crippled man accepting deformity as natural transformation granted by Heaven. These tales teach accepting change rather than controlling it, recognizing beauty in what conventional society rejects, achieving freedom by releasing attachment to particular outcomes. The sage "rides the normalization of the inconstant" and "wanders beyond the dust and grime," accepting life and death as natural transformations like seasons cycling, neither grasping existence nor fearing extinction but flowing with the great transformation (da hua) that forever generates and dissolves all forms through the boundless Dao.

*** 1.9.118 Philosophical Daoism Response

Change constitutes the fundamental character of reality expressed through complementary polarities (yin-yang) arising from the Dao's mysterious operation, requiring philosophical understanding that transcends ordinary language and logic to grasp the source of all becoming beyond being and non-being. Philosophical Daoism (as distinguished from religious practices) emphasizes contemplative wisdom over ritual technique, developing sophisticated metaphysical analysis of transformation's ultimate nature while maintaining practical orientation toward liberated living.

The Dao functions as both source and pattern of change. The Daodejing states: "The Dao gave birth to one; one gave birth to two; two gave birth to three; three gave birth to the ten thousand things." This describes neither temporal creation nor physical causation but logical priority—the undifferentiated Dao (wu-name) manifests as existence (you-being) containing potential for differentiation into yin-yang polarity whose interaction generates all multiplicity. Yet this "production" differs from Western creation: things emerge spontaneously (ziran—self-so) rather than through intentional design or external force.

The yin-yang framework explains change's mechanism: all phenomena contain both receptive (yin) and active (yang) aspects in dynamic balance. When yang reaches extreme, it transforms into yin; when yin culminates, yang emerges. Day becomes night, summer turns to winter, youth ages into elderhood, life ends in death which generates new life. These transformations aren't random but follow reliable patterns called tianli (heavenly patterns). Understanding these patterns enables living in harmony with change rather than suffering from resisting inevitable transformation.

Wang Bi's commentary revolutionized Daoist interpretation by emphasizing wu (non-being) as ontological foundation. All determinate beings (you) arise from and return to wu, which isn't mere nothing but pregnant emptiness enabling all positive manifestation. Change thus moves between being and non-being: forms emerge from formlessness, names arise from namelessness, yet always remain grounded in the ungraspable Dao that "does nothing yet nothing remains undone" (wei wu wei). Liberation comes through identifying with this creative emptiness rather than with particular forms subject to dissolution. By emptying mind of fixed concepts, the sage becomes like the Dao itself—formless yet capable of all forms, empty yet source of all fullness, unchanging in essence yet manifesting all change, perfectly responding to circumstances because untethered to any particular attachment.

*** 1.9.119 Religious Daoism Response

Change operates through the transformation of jing (essence), qi (vital energy), and shen (spirit) cultivated through alchemical practices, ritual performance, and deity invocation aimed at achieving immortality and transcending ordinary cosmic cycles. Religious Daoism (as distinguished from philosophical speculation) emphasizes practical techniques for bodily transformation, viewing the human organism as microcosm mirroring macrocosmic processes, offering methods to harmonize with celestial patterns and even reverse natural deterioration.

Internal alchemy (neidan) cultivates the Three Treasures—jing, qi, shen—through meditation, breathing exercises, and visualization. The process "reverses the flow": instead of jing dissipating through sexual activity, it's refined into qi; instead of qi dispersing through ordinary breathing and emotion, it's condensed into shen; instead of shen scattering through mundane consciousness, it's unified into emptiness (xu) merging with the Dao. This reversal constitutes literal physiological transformation: practitioners report warmth in lower abdomen (return of prenatal qi), light in spiritual center, and eventually formation of the "immortal embryo" gestating within until mature enough to survive independently of physical body.

External alchemy (waidan) seeks longevity through ingesting purified substances—cinnabar, gold, jade—believed to contain concentrated yang essence resisting decay. Though literal mineral consumption proved toxic, the symbolic framework persists: combining substances representing yin-yang, five phases, and celestial influences produces elixir of immortality. Temple rituals, talisman magic, and deity invocation complement personal cultivation. Priests perform cosmic renewal ceremonies, submit memorials to celestial bureaucracy, exorcise malevolent forces, and channel divine energies—all manipulating change through esoteric knowledge and ritual power.

The pantheon of immortals (xian) demonstrates transformation's possibility: beings who achieved longevity and supernatural powers through cultivation. These include physical immortals dwelling in hidden mountain paradises, celestial immortals ascending to heavenly courts, and realized masters who escaped death entirely. Their hagiographies provide practical instruction—what practices they employed, which difficulties they overcame, which deities they propitiated. Ordinary cosmic becoming leads inexorably to death and rebirth; Daoist cultivation promises transcendence: either through longevity extending hundreds of years or through complete transformation into immortal being no longer subject to decay, achieving changeless existence through perfecting the art of transformation itself.

*** 1.9.120 Shinto Response

Change flows through the kami's (spirits/deities) dynamic presence within all natural and human phenomena, requiring ritual purification and seasonal observance to harmonize individual and communal life with cosmic rhythms pervading sacred landscape. Shinto lacks systematic philosophy comparable to Buddhism or Confucianism; its understanding of becoming emerges through ritual practice, mythological narrative, and aesthetic sensibility emphasizing gratitude, purity, and reverence for the sacred energy (musubi) generating and sustaining existence.

The creation myths in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki present becoming through kami activity: Izanagi and Izanami generate the Japanese islands through procreative stirring of primordial chaos with jeweled spear; their offspring include kami of fire, water, mountains, rice—each natural phenomenon contains divine presence. This differs from transcendent creator God of Western religion; kami are immanent within natural processes. Mountains aren't created by distant deity but are kami themselves; rivers flow as divine activity; storms manifest Susanoo's turbulent energy. Change thus represents kami's ongoing life rather than mechanical causation or metaphysical principle.

Ritual practice harmonizes human becoming with kami presence. Daily shrine visits, seasonal festivals (matsuri), and life-cycle ceremonies mark transitions requiring acknowledgment and blessing. Hatsumode (first shrine visit of new year) establishes proper relationship with time's renewal; rice planting and harvest festivals honor agricultural cycles; coming-of-age, marriage, and funeral rites consecrate personal transformations. Each involves purification (harae)—washing hands and mouth, ritual sprinkling, in extreme cases misogi (full water ablution)—removing tsumi (impurity/pollution) that accumulates through death, disease, or moral transgression. Purity allows proper receptivity to kami's blessing and guidance.

The aesthetic concept of mono no aware (pathos of things) captures Shinto sensitivity to change's poignancy: cherry blossoms' brief flowering becomes more beautiful precisely because transient; autumn leaves' brilliant colors intensify through awareness of impending winter; human relationships deepen through acknowledging impermanence. This differs from Buddhist emphasis on detachment from transitory phenomena; Shinto affirms attachment to this world's beauty even while recognizing its ephemerality. Change thus evokes grateful appreciation—each moment unique, each season precious, each life sacred—not despite impermanence but because of it, calling humans to live fully present to the kami's generous gift of continuously renewed existence flowing through sacred land, seasons, relationships, and the mysterious power (musubi) binding all things together.
