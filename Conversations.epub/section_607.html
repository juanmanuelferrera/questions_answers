<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One friend of the temple, one man, he has purchased it at a very high price, and he has lent it for your stay. These glasses are bulletproof. [break] This is a Lincoln Continental, Ford company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he stopped? [break] ...without car? (Brahmānanda laughs) [break] ...Nixon's home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He has in Florida, Key Biscayne. He had two homes, one in Florida, one in California. But now he's staying in Florida. Recently he went to New York and testified before a committee. It's the first time that he has spoken publicly since his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that committee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They were investigating the Watergate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh, he had to present himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. It's the first time any ex-chief executive has ever testified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is not out of danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, they're still investigating the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I heard that he made a condition that he will no more be bothered. On this condition, he agreed to resign. [break] ...India the trouble is dissention between Indira Gandhi and Jaya Prakash Nārāyaṇa. So that Jaya Prakash Nārāyaṇa is fasting, I have heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That gentleman said. The doctor said. He's seventy-nine years of age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventy-nine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Is there any danger to us from her arresting so many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now she has clearly indicated that she is like a dictator. Otherwise how could she arrest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So both of them are in distressed condition. I am thinking of writing them about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Do you think it is advised? They can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think Nixon would be more inclined to read it than Mrs. Gandhi. Because she already has rejected Hindu culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gandhi. I mean, she always turns towards the Muslims more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, she has guru. And she is going occasionally to Anandamayi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah, that guru has spoken highly of our movement. In Germany there was an interview of him in one German magazine, and he was asked about all different types of groups. And most of the groups he criticized, but our group he gave his recommendation, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I don't remember exactly, but he stressed the importance of the chanting of the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> He said "It is an important means for God realization, and by doing this, one can achieve love of God, and they are spreading this all over the world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what do you think? Shall I write? Hm? I have made a draft of letter this night. So you come and see. Let us take a chance. We want actually good for everyone. And this is the only medicine, Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> For any problem. <span class="Italic">Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.</span> People are suffering. If her guru has opined like that, then she may take some attention. Then it appears that guru is to some extent nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She gave interview to our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I saw her twice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you saw? How did (s)he talk with you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She was very respectful. And she wished our movement well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She said that she had difficulty to take an active part, because then she would have to take an active part in all such movements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. That's it. That is the difficulty. She said frankly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Because we asked her to attend the cornerstone ceremony at Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, shall we take a chance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it might be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Then write two registered letters, one to Jaya Prakash Narayana... [break] ...astrologer, who was telling me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, Bhāvānanda Mahārāja, he knows. The astrologer in Māyāpur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> Oh, Mr... In Svarūp Gañj there's one big astrologer. So he saw your photograph, and he said, "This is the face of the most powerful spiritual personality on the planet."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Then what else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> Then he said that "I can tell from his face that he can make a house in which the whole world can live peacefully."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least I desire so. [break] Where your preaching was going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were preaching in Berkeley, California. Our other parties are spread out all over the country. One party is in Massachusetts, another party is in the South, southern United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where in Massachusetts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Amherst area. Then another party is in Michigan, another party in Illinois, another party is in Washington, in the state of Washington. There's a couple of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So his parties are working more. And book selling is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yeah. This past month we sold nearly five thousand big books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And about 120,000 <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are surpassing, what is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Tripurāri Mahārāja. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we're just following in his footsteps. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> ...a bus now, so he's going to compete by making new devotees and expanding his ranks. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...competition amongst the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> who can satisfy Kṛṣṇa more. In the spiritual world there is also competition. [break] ...two parties, one, Rādhārāṇī's party, and one, Candravāli's party. (Car horn honks) Come on. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They were saluting us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Outsider?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When we distribute these books, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we think that it is you who are distributing them, that they are your books, and we are simply assisting to offer them to people. It is actually you who are doing all the preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Kṛṣṇa's book, we are all servants, engaged. [break] (laughing) Here your parents accusing me, and in India the caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> accusing me. My standing... I do not know what is my standing. Your parents are accusing me, "This rascal, converting our sons to become mendicant without any material enjoyment." And there, "This rascal is giving sacred thread to the <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas.</span>" (Still laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Is that why you keep traveling, Prabhupāda, so they won't catch you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nārada Muni was accused by Prajāpati Dakṣa that "You are traveling in the dress of a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> but you are the most sinful man. You have turned my sons in the renounced order of life to become beggar, without any advancement, without any enjoyment." So that accusation is always there, beginning from Nārada Muni down to us. Some parents came to demonstrate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In Los Angeles, yes. I understand they've demonstrated before, someone was saying? They had placards, and they were marching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> In Laguna Beach they also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Dr. Judah has said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He has dedicated his book, "To the parents and to the devotees."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has tried to pacify the parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Another parent is coming to see you today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, to accuse me? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, her son said she is very favorable. She's the mother of Parīkṣit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your mother was very angry upon us. (laughter) You know that? When she came to see me, I told, "Mrs. Bruce, can you give me some money?" (laughing) (Imitating angry woman's voice:) "I have given you two sons!" (laughter) She was very angry. "Still you want money?" (laughter) "And that's all right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You asked them to bow down to her?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I asked him to bow down to your mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, at initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did she like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I gave her proper respect. Mother, after all, she is. She is fortunate mother. She has produced such nice sons. And I offered her respect, yes. Any of your mother and father, they are all very fortunate. And you are doing... giving the best service to your family. Our Nitāi's mother came. She looked very nice lady, yes. I think you are the first child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore she looks young, not very old. Within forty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Over forty, I think. Within fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. But she looks younger. And your grandmother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> She is eighty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...Dakṣa accused Nārada that "My sons were not out of the three kinds of debts." One debt is debtor to the saintly sages. Just like we are reading <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> we are indebted to Vyāsadeva. He has given such literature, and we are taking advantage of it. As such, especially the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they have got indebtedness to big sages and saintly person. They receive knowledge from them. And they are indebtor to the demigods. Therefore they have to perform <span class="Italic">yajñas.</span> And they are indebtor to their father because the father has brought them to this world. So in this way, especially a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is indebted to demigods, the past sages, and the father. So the indebtedness to the sages is performed by becoming <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> and to the demigods by offering sacrifices, and to the father by begetting children, to continue the progeny. So Nārada Muni was accused that "You keep them indebted to these principles, so how they can be liberated? Simply by dressing like you, (laughs) a mendicant?" Accusing. But perhaps he did not know. There is another version in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṛṇāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>nāyam ṛṇī na ca kiṅkaro rājan<br class="calibre2"/>sarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ saraṇyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>gato mukunda parihṛtya...<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 11.5.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Anyone who has fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is no more debtor to anyone. And Kṛṣṇa says that "You surrender to Me, and I shall keep you protected from all kinds of..." Because if you don't repay your debts, then you become sinful. But Kṛṣṇa says, "I shall protect for all kinds of sin." So if anyone has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is no more debtor to anyone. He is immune from all obligation. His only obligation is to Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...has eaten up this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This tree? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes when we're reading <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> about the <span class="Italic">prajāpatis...</span> They are such exalted persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. They are no ordinary person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yet sometimes they behave in such a way that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... After all, they are living entity, conditioned. They are also conditioned. They are not liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're not pure devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They want enjoyment, material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Still, they're entrusted with very big posts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But Lord Brahmā, he's a <span class="Italic">prajāpati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is the chief <span class="Italic">prajāpati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Isn't he a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And yet he composed the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is devotee, not to the topmost extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes we hear that Lord Brahmā incarnated as Ṭhākura Haridāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Sometimes devotees say, "Then how come he's the head of our <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> if he's not a pure devotee?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't require. He is a devotee. That's all right. There are grades of devotee, but on the whole, a devotee is very exalted person. Just like <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> Nobody can be compared with the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> There are so many grades of devotees, but they are ultimate. And amongst the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> Rādhārāṇī. So there is no comparison, no more... Even Kṛṣṇa is defeated there. Kṛṣṇa became Caitanya Mahāprabhu to understand the devotion of Rādhārāṇī. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. [break] (About something by the path:) ...queen. Elizabeth? No. Queen or king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is there a plaque there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's a symbol for something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They usually make justice to be like that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Allegorical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Allegorical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It's not a historial person. One lady represents learning, another... They represent different things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All, women. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...imperson.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Cupid is there, and it is marked "love."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] (To Harikeśa, who has been coughing throughout:) ...not taking any medicine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This continuing is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I stopped eating anything but fruit, and that's what I did. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...examined your chest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you should examine your chest. Some congestion in the lungs. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, around our society now there are many devotees who are following different kinds of diets. They read some book and they get some idea. They follow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And one of the things I see about the unique feature of all the diets that they have in common is that the devotees more or less stop taking the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> which is offered to the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It seems to me that one of the important aspects of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is to depend upon Kṛṣṇa for one's maintenance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So whatever is offered to the Deity, one should accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is not suitable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well it is standard <span class="Italic">prasādam. Capatis,</span> rice, <span class="Italic">dahl, subji,</span> fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they do not like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, they are reading these books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And becoming influenced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nonsense. This should be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> A lot of devotees, they take these fasting for twenty days, thirty days, fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are manufacturing their own way of life. That's not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One of our best devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he recently left our association. And one of the... I know the biggest reason is that he was fasting completely from almost all foods for thirty days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But fasting is good. If one can fast, that is good. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But see, they read these books in addition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fasting is not bad. If one can fast, that is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Total fast, you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I remember in Los Angeles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is great austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that we should not fast more than one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, I wanted to point out to you that the results...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, artificial... Just like Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, he was fasting, but he was not weak. That fasting. And he who will fast artificially and become weak, "I cannot work," that is not required. That is called <span class="Italic">markaṭa-vairāgya.</span> If you fast and at the same time you do not become weak, then that is recommended. And after fasting you cannot do a flat, fall flat, then what is the use of fasting? Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was fasting, but he was taking thrice bathing and offering obeisances hundred times. His regular activities was not stopped. And he was taking every alternate day a little quantity of butter. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we cannot imitate his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. We have to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. One of the important things about taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is that all the devotees sit together. It is actually a very spiritual activity. Just like in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> the feasts...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That is recommended, that we are following. But now it is not following?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I have to say frankly, I have seen now that in many... I don't want to get into mentioning any names, but some devotees are preaching this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching? Who is that nonsense, preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, Revatīnandana Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is preaching like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal. He is becoming rascal, day by day. Stop him doing these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he's influencing other people. The whole temple in Laguṇa Beach, they were doing this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, what can I do? You are all GBCs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now that we know, we'll take action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Revatinandana is becoming less and less spiritually. He had good potency, but he is losing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You said that if we fast and we can't do our work and we become weak, than this is not so good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not good, "not so" not, absolutely bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So, our devotional service comes first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So if there is, let us say there is grain and rice being offered to the Deities, and one finds that if he eats this, his service is impaired. Like so many times I've seen, practically myself if I overeat grains in the summertime, I drive around doing my service and I'm falling asleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then which foodstuff suits you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Fruits are more... they keep me more active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you take fruit. Fruit is also offered to the Deity. There are varieties of <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So whichever suits, you can take. Anything artificial is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Los Angeles they are charging money for the <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and we find that it's cheaper to buy our own <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and offer it ourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They are charging money in Los Angeles for the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> each meal, so we find it is cheaper to...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. They will not let a householder take unless they pay money first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> 75c for noon prasādam and 50c for breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you can prepare cheaper, you can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> All right. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's a type of cannon. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> You mentioned before that it is better that we not do so much cooking. If everyone is separately cooking, then that is such a time-consuming thing for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you said that "If we cook, it is cheaper." Then? If it is cheaper, convenient, then you cook. I said that "You save time. Don't cook."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The cheapest thing is to cook one thing for... cook for everyone. That is the cheapest and quickest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> During Māyāpur festival, Śrīla Prabhupāda, nicest thing was when we all sat down together and took <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> Five hundred devotees, it was nice, spiritual activity. And everyone took what was given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the difficulty? I do not find. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> ...the tongue, I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Capati,</span> rice is innocent food. What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> It's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Over and above, there is fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A lot of devotees are quoting you that... they say that there is no need to eat grains, that you said grains were for the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But Prabhupāda is eating grains. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I tell them that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, they say, "Prabhupāda says." And you believe that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> ...I think the people are spoiled. If they go to India, they see that here they're turning down rice; there the people are dying for lack of rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> In India. And here they're saying, "Oh, I don't want this and don't want that. I don't want this grain, that grain." But in India people are dying for want of food. Here they're so spoiled. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa's position. If He does not supply grains, then He is accused. And He supplies grains, then He is accused. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> Everyone is accused. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...those scientists came to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and even said milk was no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> That is what they say in these books on health, these health books. They say that cow milk is no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But meat is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> No, some of them, most of them don't say that. It's very contaminating to read those and to follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore follow taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Let whatever may happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the best thing. Let us die eating <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter) That is devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Because in the beginning, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you encouraged us, all of us, to take much <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> to our full satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I say still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> You said that that is one of our greatest weapons against <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> is <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prasāda.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I'm a good example that these diets are not very good. (laughter) I can testify.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The diets are not good or you are not good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Oh. [break] ...for one year to alter the diet in so many ways and it never worked. It was useless. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I think that's for maintaining the right depth to the lake. I think they have a pump house down here, and they maintain the depth of the lake by these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water is supplied or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In Denver here we have many businesses going on for you. And we are out engaging <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> in helping us retrieve <span class="Italic">lakṣmī.</span> We are going to them for <span class="Italic">lakṣmī</span> in so many ways. How is it that this engages them, or does it engage them in Kṛṣṇa's service? Do they make any benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they are doing by doing business? They are <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> doing business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are outsiders, <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they manufacture jewelry and some shirts, for which they get a salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, but the devotees are maintaining the business. And I myself go out and talk to rascals all day long, demons, <span class="Italic">mlecchas.</span> Am I engaging them in Kṛṣṇa's service by taking <span class="Italic">lakṣmī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you are doing with the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I'm giving it to the temple president so that we can buy a farm for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you are engaging the money for Kṛṣṇa, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's asking about is there any benefit to the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> that he deals with because he engages in business activity with them? Do the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> get benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. To some extent they are helping Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They also have this program in Pittsburg, the same thing. They come to the temple and manufacture jewelry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> It is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You can see there. Everyone can work, but the result of the work should go to Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">...lakṣmī</span> from them so we can engage them more in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Provided you engage them for Kṛṣṇa's service. Otherwise the <span class="Italic">lakṣmī</span> will kill you. Just like Sītā, Sītā is <span class="Italic">Lakṣmī.</span> When Sītā was taken by Rāvaṇa, the result was the whole family was killed because they did not use Sītā for Rāma's service. [break] ...householders can be engaged, not anyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So my question is: Supposing half of those men that are in our movement are householders. Would it not be more beneficial that everyone engages in preaching work, or is that impractical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching is for the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> for the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> And householder, because they are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they can be engaged in Deity worship and also earning money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it's not more practical to earn money by preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If preaching, by preaching we can get money, why should we go to the <span class="Italic">karmīs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because you wrote me in a letter that so far as you are concerned, you think that your books are enough to maintain the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think so. But if they think that by doing some other business, they will get more money, then what can I say? This is very good business. Yes. We are preaching, at the same time getting money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We have found in our experience that some kinds of men do better in doing business. They feel more satisfied in collecting money in that way for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But that money should be used for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. Different kinds of men have to be engaged in different ways. Otherwise they become dissatisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā.</span> Anyone, he likes to do something, that is his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> But by that <span class="Italic">karma,</span> he can serve Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiṁ labhate navaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhi</span> means perfection.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...in our preaching work we will be able to maintain our temples, and with our business activities, we will be able to expand and buy all these farms, do so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If it is favorable, do it, business.(?) Therefore we have made program: 50% must come to Kṛṣṇa, at least. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] (In car:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...because that many people are involved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dieting, the best thing is to take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Definitely. It's clear cut. My only feeling about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if our... Pushed on our men... The thing is they supply more spices, and especially that mustard. This is not good. This is prohibited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It should be mild, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practically no spices. Simply little cumin. And this turmeric. Turmeric you get from India, whole turmeric. This powdered turmeric is very, very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Unhealthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They put sawdust in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's very unhealthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very cheating. Any powdered spice is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Asafoetida also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. As soon as it is powder, they will mix with all rubbish things. And it is very easy to cheat you. You are susceptible for being cheated. So they take advantage and cheat you. So best thing is to import spices from India whole and either get it powdered or during time of cooking you make them paste. That is first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Crushing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You just put the spices water, soaked in water for some time, and then in mortar and pestle you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Smash it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very nice. And immediately you fresh prepare and put into the vegetable. It will be tasteful, and it will be beneficial. All spices are beneficial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And much cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheaper, of course, there is no question to you what is cheaper. For you everything is "damn cheap."</div>
