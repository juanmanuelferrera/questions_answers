<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was not killing. So instead of wasting his time, he said "I don't care for your <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It is my order that you stop if you love me." Here is... You cannot open slaughterhouse, giving reference to the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> or any sacrifice, either in the Muhammadans, Jews and everyone. They also make sacrifice. One day in the year they sacrifice. It is not that they recommend open slaughterhouse. This is all nonsense, <span class="Italic">rākṣasa.</span> That sacrifice also recommended in this sense, that you cannot stop animal killing; there will be a class of men who'll eat meat. To give them some concession, so this is recommended, "All right, if you want to eat meat, you sacrifice." Amongst the Hindus, just like <span class="Italic">Kālī-pūjā, Durgā-pūjā,</span> the animal-eaters, they are given this concession, that "If you want to eat meat, you just worship Goddess Kālī," and this Goddess Kālī worshiping is recommended on the <span class="Italic">amāvasyā,</span> on the dark moon night, one day in a month, and the dead of night. So if one goes on eating meat in this way, one day in a month and dead of night, then he automatically will give it up. "So much botheration. Better give it up." Actually denies. "Yes, you can eat once in a month and at the dead of night, when everyone will sleep, nobody can hear the screaming of the animal." These are the recommendations. That is indirectly denying. If one is intelligent, he'll accept it that "Why so much botheration for eating meat? Better give it up."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there are so many gurus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not talking of so many gurus... We are talking of real guru. That's all, real guru. Real guru is he who talks in disciplic succession of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is guru. The <span class="Italic">bhumi-phala</span> (?) guru is no guru. <span class="Italic">Avaiṣṇavo gurur na sa syāt.</span> "Anyone who is not Vaiṣṇava, he is not guru." Or He says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Bhagavān, <span class="Italic">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this. He is guru who is preaching what Kṛṣṇa has taught. He is guru, not that anyone and everyone becomes guru. No. If you want to be cheated by such rascal guru, that is your business, but who is guru, that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> No? Anyone who preaches the teachings of Kṛṣṇa, he is guru. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says, <span class="Italic">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa:</span> [Cc. Madhya 7.128] "You become a guru on My order." "How shall I become guru? I have no knowledge." Oh, you don't require any knowledge to manufacture. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha, tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa: [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128] "Simply repeat the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, you become guru." Everyone can become. The instruction is there. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> We say the same thing, not that I have become Kṛṣṇa, not my... You say that "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." Then you become guru. Kṛṣṇa instruction, not to become Kṛṣṇa. If you want to become Kṛṣṇa, then you are not guru; you are cheater. Suppose you are working for master. If you say, "My master has fixed up this price. You cannot change it," then you are honest salesman. And if you place yourself that "I am the master," then you are cheater. The cheater cannot be teacher. Teacher is he who simply teaches what Kṛṣṇa has said, that's all. He's teacher. That is not difficult. Everyone can do. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha, tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa: [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128] "Whomever you meet, you simply speak to him the instruction of Kṛṣṇa." Then you become guru. And if you don't say that, if you manufacture your own words, then you are cheater, you are not teacher. So the so-called gurus, they are cheater. They want to become Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are cheater. And it is very easy thing. If you cheat people that "You take this <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and you become God..." Is God so easy thing, to become God? But they want to be cheated. "Purchasing <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> I shall become God." They want to be cheated. They do not think that "Whether I can actually become God?" They do not take the weight of His existence. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So what is the time now.</div>
