<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...I.A.S. civil service examination before one man is posted in some responsible office. Similarly, to be recognized by Kṛṣṇa, as He says <span class="Italic">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">,</span> one has to pass examination, severe test of examination. All the big, big devotees we see. Nārada Muni, before becoming Nārada Muni, he had to pass through severe examination, test. That chance is there in the human form of life, to pass the examination, test. But they are passing this human life with ordinary animal propensities. They are not trained up to pass the examination and be recognized by God. That civilization is lost, Vedic civilization, to prepare the human beings for passing the test, examination for being recognized by God.</div>
<div class="Verse">tapasā brahmacaryeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>śamena ca damena ca<br class="calibre2"/>tyāgena satya-śaucābhyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yamena niyamena vā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These things are required, <span class="Italic">tapasā brahmacaryeṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> To pass the examination, one must follow a strict, austere life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa,</span> beginning <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity. <span class="Italic">Brahmacarya,</span> celibacy. <span class="Italic">Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> controlling the senses, controlling the mind. <span class="Italic">Tyāgena,</span> by renunciation. <span class="Italic">Satya-śaucābhyām,</span> by following truthfulness and cleanliness. <span class="Italic">Yamena niyamena vā,</span> by practicing yoga, <span class="Italic"> yama-niyama.</span> These are the different items of being qualified. But all these things can be done by one stroke, <span class="Italic">kevalayā bhaktyā,</span> by engaging oneself in devotion, <span class="Italic">vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">kecit kevalayā bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena<br class="calibre2"/>nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One becomes qualified by one stroke of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> to Vāsudeva. Just like the sunrise immediately dissipates the fog. <span class="Italic">Aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.</span> In the Kali-yuga, this one item of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> can make one perfectly fit candidate to pass the examination. <span class="Italic">Aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.</span> What is this nonsense life? There is no <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> no spiritual culture, simply like cats and dogs. Last night I was reading. Vāmanadeva created a planet, Sutala, in which Viśvakarmā was ordered to construct big, big houses, palaces, better than in the heavenly planet. And these rascals are going and seeing simply rocks and sand. And what about these palaces and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> In Koran it is described that there is a very dangerous bridge that one has to pass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is described in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, Vaitaraṇī</span>, cross from the material to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And it is fire in both sides, and it is like a razor edge, it could be very thin. And the saintly persons close their eyes and pass it. Kṛṣṇa makes them pass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similar description is there, <span class="Italic">bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām [SB </span>10.14.58]<span class="Italic">. Bhavāmbudhiḥ,</span> the great ocean of material nescience, it becomes <span class="Italic">vatsa-padam,</span> just like the water contained in the hoof impression of a calf. <span class="Italic">Bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ param.</span> Exactly animal civilization. Animal does not know what is future, what is past, what is going to happen, nothing. The human civilization has become like that. Professor Kotovsky said, "Swamiji, after finishing this body, everything is finished." He's a big professor in Moscow. This is their civilization. What do they explain about the lower animals? Wherefrom they come, the birds, beasts, trees, insects?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Where, in Koran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say the modern scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Modern scientists. One theory is the evolutionary process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So wherefrom evolution begins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They don't know how it began. Some say it came from water. How does life begin? Nobody really knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say there has to be certain combination of gases, ammonia, water, some hydrogen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot make this gas and combine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the way they are testing for life on Mars. This is one of the tests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why Mars? In their laboratory they can make gas and mix.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well they say that they've made amino acids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot make?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've made that, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they cannot produce life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They haven't succeeded in having it develop any further than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have not succeeded in a thing which they proposed as the origin of life. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I remember they showed the experiment on TV on a science program, and they said "Now we've discovered how to make life." And they showed this chamber, and they put these gases in and an electrical spark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there was life? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And they made these amino acids. So they said "We've created life. Now, it won't be long before we can develop..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you have to wait one million years. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Is it true, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that Kṛṣṇa is testing us every day? We're having tests, opportunities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just like if you want responsible post, then there is question of test. If you want to become a vagabond, remain vagabond. Where is question of test?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, for devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, for devotees, there is test. For devotees there is test. We see from the devotee's life, Prahlāda Mahārāja, how much severe test he had to pass through. Bali Mahārāja, Nārada Muni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And the most advanced the devotee is, the more severe the test is, the more chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, after you pass the examination, there is no more test. But before coming to the post of recognized devotee, Kṛṣṇa tests very severely. That one has to pass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I read once in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> in one of your purports, you said that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is there to test the sincerity of the candidate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we see from the life of Bali Mahārāja, how he was put into difficulty. Even his spiritual master cursed him. [break] ...put into test and still he remains in his determination, then he's passed. That is very natural. And there is a word, "acid test"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For ascertaining real gold, the acid test one has to pass to become real gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> [break] ...this test depends on one's faith in Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith in Kṛṣṇa? What do you mean by faith?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you want to pass the test, he says, does that depend on one's faith?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does that faith mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Conviction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that conviction? Describe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That Kṛṣṇa is the controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is controller. You may have faith or no faith, that doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If one is convinced that Kṛṣṇa will always protect him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> When he's convinced to abide by the instructions of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith means that you are meant for giving some service to Kṛṣṇa. You should stick to that service, that path, in spite of all impediments. That is the passing of test. Generally, just like we are meant for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So there may be severe test, but still we shall remain determined. That is wanted. There may be so many impediments, punishment, still you should do that. That is wanted. That is test. Not that as soon as there is some difficulty I give it up. There may be severe test, but still we shall not give it up. We must go on. That is determination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Passing the test means executing the order of the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is spiritual life. One has to take order from the spiritual master and execute it, despite all impediments. That is determination. What are these pictures dancing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Modern sculpture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are dancing on snake or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For collecting few dry leaves, three, four servants are engaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> More than that. They have about, they must have about twenty men around here sweeping the path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When we were here the other morning at least a dozen or so walked past, and there were others working elsewhere, and they were all sweeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there are many servants. What is their general payment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> About eight hundred rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundred dollars. What is the average expenditure here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Depends on how one lives; it is quite expensive. Eight thousand, ten thousand rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No. Just for food, it is per head, simple devotee food, per person, about five hundred rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. In India... India, two hundred rupees per month. And it has increased very recently. In 1930, we were paying servant twelve to fourteen rupees per month, and they were satisfied. With food, six rupees. And without food, twelve rupees, fourteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> That means it cost only six rupees per month for food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the hotel also they were charging six rupees. Means third-class hotel, not first class for cooking <span class="Italic">dāl,</span> vegetables. Rice was, first-class rice, six rupees per month. <span class="Italic">Dāl,</span> twelve annas for kg, flour, five annas for two and a half kgs. And from 1942, all of a sudden the price increased, artificially. Milk, two annas per kg. Now three rupees, four rupees. <span class="Italic">Ghee,</span> first-class <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> one rupee per kg. First-class <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> [break] ...paying for the clerks thirty rupees per month. And head clerk, sixty rupees. Officers, hundred to two hundred rupees. High-court judges, four thousand rupees. High-court judges were highly paid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Iran at that time was even cheaper, much cheaper. Because you had the British in India, you were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when India was native state, they were cheaper. In India, this inflation was caused by Mr. Churchill. During the war he wanted men to join the fighting, so people were not coming. So artificially...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Printed money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, artificially increased the price. So they were obliged to join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He'd increase the price and then advertise free food in the army.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (passerby makes comment)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He first said "Please pray for me." But then he's joking. He's saying also that he should take good care of us, we are guests here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That man should take good care of us, bring us tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> They drink too much tea here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Yes. Every place you go they offer you tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's our Praṇava dāsa, in Vṛndāvana. He, as you remember, he had some difficulties there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He creates the difficulty.(?) He came to Vṛndāvana as retired life, but instead of that he wanted to make some personal profit. That is his difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So, is he, does he have any sincerity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He has no sincerity. We should not encourage him to come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He's after sense gratification. He requested you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he'll do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Well, I thought that he's a devotee and I should engage him, we should engage him here. But of course, if he's not sincere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's trying to get such opportunities. He's requesting so many, "Take me here, take me there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So I should not do it because we will have problem. We would be in anxiety here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came to Vṛndāvana for the purpose of devotion, but he had some other motive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Not give up, would not give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To take advantage for sense gratification. Why he wants to come here? He requested similarly Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He wanted to go to Detroit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Detroit, everyone is trying to take some advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Everybody thinks America is everything. A heavenly planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for India it is heavenly planet, certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> I'm sure there is always a lot of people who gather around American devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To exploit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They want money, they want this, they want benefit, some sort of, this I can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the price of this bread?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Five rials, it's about half a rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> It's big, it's good. It is good bread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> It is subsidized by the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still half a rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Government pays half on the price, more than half the price. That is why if Iranian poor people, with very little salary, they can survive. They can eat this bread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> We had asked Praṇava to help arrange for a cook to come here. We'd asked help to arrange for a cook, so we could open a small <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> restaurant. And he's written back that "I have made arrangements for a cook, and also I would like to come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We can get someone else. [break] ...strong but dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not dangerous if the both of them become devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> If they understand the purpose of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise it is dangerous</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They can fool each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is generally done. Wife increases the responsibility. <span class="Italic">Strī-vistāra.</span> But still one has to maintain wife. A <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> has no responsibility. His only responsibility is to serve Kṛṣṇa. But a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> has many responsibilities. "There is the children, I have to give them education, see that they're well situated."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> A <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> life. A devotee who has not had experience with the responsibility...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, responsible... He has no, this material responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> But he has responsibility towards Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So he should know about responsibility, he should have experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real business of human life is to take responsibility of spiritual advancement. So if one remain <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> he has no disturbance in that responsibility. But if he becomes a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> that disturbance is there. You cannot take wholeheartedly the spiritual responsibility. (end)</div>
