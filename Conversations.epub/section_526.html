<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...otherwise, we recommend everyone become <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> What is the use of not becoming? (all laugh) We are giving up this world. We are preparing ourself for entering into the family of Kṛṣṇa. So why should we be very much anxious to maintain this family. So actually... Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says; "I'm not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> I'm not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> I'm not a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> I'm not a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span>" These four, eight <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is unecessary for spiritually. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was speaking with Rāmānanda Rāya... You'll find in the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya...</span> As soon as he suggested <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> Rāmaṇanda Rāya, immediately Caitanya Mahāprabhu: "It is not very important. If you know better than this, you go on." He did not give any, much stress on this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> But for regulated life, that is required. And ultimately, it is not required. So it is not recommended for ordinary persons. But this is also unnecessary. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching is so sublime, that such things, which is the beginning of human life, that is also unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Iha bahya age kaha ara. Bahya</span> means "this is superflous. You speak something higher than this." That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So that is not very easy thing. First of all, we have to live very regulated life. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> life is that regulated life. And then we can enter into the real life. That is ideal. So anything more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Any more on those five points? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...Prabhupāda, beginning of new temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shut them. Moving temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He's questioning about the selling... There's one resolution that all the paintings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Let Prabhupāda explain his point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You want to expand this point of moving temples, rather than permanent temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Moving temple means through bus, going from one place to another. That is better. From one temple, they go from village to village, town to town. That will be nice. Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally did not establish any temple. He was moving. Is it not? So that's all right. We should be very much cautious to establish a new center. And if one establishes, he cannot close it. This should be the principle. Yes. Don't whimsically open a temple and close next day. No. Don't do that. If once established, it must be maintained, at any cost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> So the question that Mahendra asked was... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...He was converting all his sons to be <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> So he cursed him that: "You cannot stay anywhere more than three minutes." That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brāhmaṇana:</span> Prabhupāda, you also show that example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You're also showing that example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Although there is no restriction, still I do not stay more than three weeks even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's very hard to keep you in one place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I'll read on. The next day's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There's a question over here... (end)</div>
