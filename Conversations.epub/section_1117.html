<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then somebody must be there to look after the construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can send one boy, Vijeta, from here. He's not doing very much, and he's on the construction department. I was just waiting for Saurabha to come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he can go, because Gaura-Govinda will be engaged for collecting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Vijeta and his wife, they can both go right now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very bitter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This medicine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? You had been there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We're going... All three of us are going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At one o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what other news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I had previously told you that the BBT was... Because it's doing very heavy printing at the moment, say, for two months we need a little loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You showed me you have got four <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is including an accounts receivable. That money's invested in books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Para-hasta tataṁ dhanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Like Gargamuni owes BBT one and a half <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. That is called <span class="Italic">para-hasta tataṁ dhanaṁ puti-gata-vidyā.</span> "I am very learned man." How? "Now I can speak when I see the books." That means "Personally, I have not assimilated anything. I can... And I have got money. I have to realize this." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, these are books already sold. These are books sold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, but the money is not in your hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He sends twenty thousand rupees every month and... These are books that... Last month only he hasn't sent us. These are books that are already sold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So realize this money. Otherwise, what is the value of this money if you cannot realize?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Also we're doing a lot of printing in Bengali and other languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, they are selling books. They must pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Yes. So I was... If we could get a loan of one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> for two or three months, because now we are printing the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> First Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that I can give, loan. I am giving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Within two or three...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you never return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I returned all your loans. In Vṛndāvana loans were all... We haven't taken any loan in Vṛndāvana. The only loan which I didn't return was which was taken from Māyāpura two years ago with Jayapatāka. They're, (I'm?) supposed to pay back. The BBT...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now you... Our big business brain is here, Rāmeśvara. If he recommends, I can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For his...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For the book expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> loan. So if you recommend, I'll give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Who's going to drive the party?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, this is for book printing. Bhavabhuti's going to handle the party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The loan is for book printing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, for book printing. We're printing the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then who's going to pay for the vehicles? You are, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think the loan is for the vehicles. Who's taking out the party? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. No, it's not. I'm going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, cool headed, you can study the situation. If you recommend, I'll give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Thing is, I only wanted you to give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you convince him. If he recommends, I'll give you. He is businesslike. I know him. So if he recommends, I'll give. He's very correct to his word. Businessman is correct to his word. That is the... No speculation. Now our Hyderabad affair is not in very order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what to do? Rāmeśvara, you are here. You can see. They are not cooperating. And besides that, Mahāṁsa takes loan. He never returns. He has taken about five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> for the temple. So I have already told to the auditor and the... They are (indistinct). This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we are working...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you keep account in such a way that whatever income it is, it is spent for books. Print some... You also do there. Whatever income you get, you spend for promotion. This principle should be followed. All businessmen are doing that. Whatever income is there, it is spent for maintenance establishment. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like if we buy a bus also, it's going to increase our expenses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotees who are actually engaged, you can give them some expenditure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think what you said, fifty rupees a week, is okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> With one child, fifty rupees a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For child only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Those who don't have children, their expenses are low so they should get less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no expenditure. What expenditure? They are getting free boarding and lodging. Maybe little. But that our ISKCON can supply. Of course, one who has got children, they require little. So manage like that, that there is no profit. That's all. Keep account in that way. So this one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees, if you take, when you'll return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll return it by March, because on this export order, it's very high profit just on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When you borrow, do you give Śrīla Prabhupāda interest on it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can give. I have never borrowed so far money. I haven't borrowed a penny so far except once when I came...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "That I did not pay." (laughs) When he takes money, he says, "No, it is not to be paid." Therefore it is no borrowing. Several times I have given you money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I've never borrowed... Just once, Jayapatāka's loan, right when I came to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Now if he recommends, I'll give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And since the Vṛndāvana temple opened, we did about three, four <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth of construction, without taking one penny from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am giving one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. That is for Gurukula. Plus we contributed about three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> to Gurukula's construction. Two <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we are paying two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the initial stages the Gurukula construction was done from the money that we had collected in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, from the beginning I am paying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> went out of Vṛndāvana temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that day is nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> February 2nd. It is Wednesday, Bhudvar. There is one good... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in Orissa you'll be also there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They want me to go back to Los Angeles for that concert, because the governor is coming. That popular Hindu singer, Lata Mangeskar, she's giving a benefit concert in Los Angeles on January 30th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who will be the big ticket purchaser?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Satsvarūpa. Oh. You mean in Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There are approximately eight thousand Hindus living in Los Angeles, and we have rented one auditorium that seats six thousand people. So if they only sell two thousand seats, it does not cost any money. It covers all the expenses. Anything over two thousand seats is profit for ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how many Indians are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Altogether in Los Angeles, eight thousand. Plus Indians from San Francisco will come to this concert because she is very popular. Gopāla sent one devotee, Jagat-puruṣa, to manage the ticket selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And we are trying to print one souvenir book also and take advertisements from local stores and shops. In this way we will also make money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have to go back? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They want me to be there to make sure the concert is a success. And Satsvarūpa Mahārāja is coming for <span class="Italic">Kumbha Mela.</span> So he's planning to stay on with you for the whole month of February and March as secretary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And you are going to Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's going to <span class="Italic">Kumbha Mela</span> first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...has business there to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not attending <span class="Italic">Kumbha Mela.</span> You are going to Delhi from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I'm thinking about going to <span class="Italic">Kumbha Mela</span> first, for a couple of days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere, this is our main program. Print books as many as possible and distribute. This is our main program. All other programs are secondary. So with this aim in view, work all together. Our <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> is unique literature. For <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> we are above any <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> There are four <span class="Italic">ācāryas:</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī... But our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's legacy, <span class="Italic">ācārya's,</span> that is unique. <span class="Italic">Anarpita-cariṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇa kalau.</span> Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is personally teaching-<span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> <span class="Italic">Anarpita-cariṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇa kalau samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasam.</span> The highest topmost bliss, <span class="Italic">madhurya.</span> These dealings of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">madhurya-rasa,</span> is the contribution of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All other <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they could not give up to this. All other <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they contributed up to friendship, no <span class="Italic">vatsalya,</span> neither <span class="Italic">madhurya.</span> That is this contribution of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There was dealings of mother Yasoda with Kṛṣṇa in the Bhāgavata. The Vallabhācāryas'...,they have got Bala-kṛṣṇa. But the dealings of gopīs with Kṛṣṇa, that was not granted. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's contribution. <span class="Italic">Anarpita-carim</span> means was never contributed. <span class="Italic">Anarpita-cariṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇa kalau samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasaṁ sva-bhakti-sriyam, hariḥ pūvata-sundara-dyuti-kadamba-sandipitaḥ sadā hṛdaya-kandare sphurati...</span> That is the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> How do they like <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> in Western...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The devotees like it. They relish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is for the devotees. It is not for the neophyte.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's a little difficult for the average man if it is his first book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not for the neophyte. Those who are actually in devotional service-for them it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Mostly we are selling <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> ratio of two <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> for every other book, twice as many <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās,</span> as an introduction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the introduction. And <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> First Canto. Mostly First Canto. We're only printing twenty thousand copies of every volume. But of First Canto we always print fifty thousand copies. And now <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we have printed one and a half million copies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's abridged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For one year's sales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very nice. (laughs) One and half million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say it is the largest printing in the history of the Western United States. They are giving Bhaktivedanta Book Trust credit now for the largest printing of any publisher in the Western United States for one title. And for our printer, the only books... He has never printed... He prints encyclopedia, he prints the Bible, but he has never printed so many copies of one book all at one time. This one and a half million copies should be printed all at once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are proud of printing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says that his press will have to run continuously for twenty days and twenty nights just to print all these books without taking any other business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a great...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In India it would take one year to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have very big, big printing press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are so proud that they have offered to hold a big press conference to announce to the press and all the journals of printers that they have gotten this order to print so many copies of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> from the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them say that. This is our advertising. And let this opposition party understand that "If it is brainwash, then your whole country is now washed. (laughter) How you'll protect them? It is already washed." Tell them like that, humorous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The price of this printing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very cheap. No, we are supplying also very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. But last year we printed 500,000 copies, this year, one and a half million copies, and the savings was $200,000. We have gotten them to reduce the price so much that now, just because we have ordered so many books, we will save 200,000...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not spend some money for advertisement? It will be noticed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can advertise them in prestigious papers like <span class="Italic">Reader's Digest</span> or printer's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nice advertisement. Spend some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That will increase our prestige.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we should advertise in America as Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, not Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. As Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. Actually, we have to keep ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Advertise as BBT, because no connection with Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got excess money, you can advertise. There is no need of keeping money. Spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Money will be excess after the Māyāpura Festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Between now and Māyāpura it's very tight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very prestigious papers like <span class="Italic">Time, Reader's Digest. Reader's Digest</span> is the highest circulation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, in the world. Śrīla Prabhupāda, the Sunday <span class="Italic">New York Times</span> has a big section just on books, and that's the most respected in the world, their books section and their book reviews. That is very prestigious. All the leading people read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But wherever you advertise, it must be prominent. It must immediately come to the notice. You can spend little more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, this advertising will also increase our college orders, because even college professors and librarians read papers. So when our salesmen go there, they'll say, "Oh, I saw your advertisement in the papers."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On nice pages(?) you just give your... Another proposal was that, some New York or somewhere somebody is proposing to sell individually. Who was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Encyclopedia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> House to house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who was speaking about that? You told me? Somebody told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Girirāja, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's a little difficult, because the way they sell encyclopedias is they leave all the books at one time, and then the person every month makes a monthly payment. So if he refuses... Once he reads the book and finds out that it is telling him to be <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakta,</span> he may stop sending his money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also it's becoming hard to enter these houses in America. In fact, door to door salesmen are having a difficult time now. Because of security reasons, they don't let any outside peddlars into the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is always, trespass. Their trespass law is very strict in USA. There are dogs, and there are revolver, and trespasser, if he is killed, there is no offense. Is it not? It is very dangerous. I know one incident in New York. Some yogi came. So he was... You know that? So I became very irritated. So I asked him, "Get him out immediately." So my men got him out. He went to the police and he said that he was assaulted and so on, complained. The police came and inquired. So there were so many inquiries. But I did not know... Then I said that "He came to me without invitation." "Oh!" Immediately he dismissed. "I did not ask him to come. He came to me and disturbed me." So immediately, "Oh..." He decided. He said, "Oh..." So that law is very strict. And that is very good. Nobody can come without invitation or engagement. Otherwise they trespass. Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes they use this law against us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We're coming to these shopping centers to sell our books and they say, "We have not invited you. Please go away." It is called the right of the property owner to allow on his property whoever he wants. So these gigantic shopping centers invite the public to buy only from them, not from us. So they restrict us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not inviting us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's all private property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Our book-selling is going on on the public property, like the airports. But the stores and the shopping centers are privately owned, so it's illegal. Sometimes our men will do it anyway, take a chance in disguise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are taking risk for Kṛṣṇa. That is great service. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇārthe 'khila ceṣṭaḥ.</span> That is one of the valuable service-for Kṛṣṇa's sake, all kinds of dangerous position. Somebody's knocking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll explain this to Rāmeśvara, and if he approves, then... Because now we have just finished hundred thousand <span class="Italic"> </span><i class="calibre3">Gītār Gāns<span class="Italic"></span></i>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, it will be paid. Just wait. (hums)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like to see some photographs of Bharadraja's work? I'll go get them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> What kind of <span class="Italic">dahl</span> would you like today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can make like yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Also, I have brought (indistinct) from the bazaar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> In which <span class="Italic">subji</span> should I put?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Put in the <span class="Italic">posta.</span> But you must (mash?) take out the skin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These were taken just before I left Los Angeles. This is a figure of Kṛṣṇa from the <span class="Italic">rasa-līlā</span> being dressed in cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His face is like Acyutānanda. (Rāmeśvara chuckles) Acyutānanda's face is beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This figure is going to be Lord Gadādhara in the exhibit of the Pañca-tattva dancing at <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> She is just beginning to make the form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have got any business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let... Let me finish [break] ...but devotees of... Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These two pictures show dolls being painted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not engage Govinda dāsī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If she will come, she can be engaged in many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is also very expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> She doesn't like the weather in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Doesn't like? Why? What is wrong there? Los Angeles is very nice. I like Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Only the spring and summer. I think it's in her mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Los Angeles is very nice. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is going to be one of the demigods in one of the exhibits. The painting is very, very expert. I've seen some of the dolls that are painted. They look alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Even in the eyes there is a little moisture as if the eye is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very natural. So I see the dolls... Intelligent boys, they can do it, educated, intelligent. Very good, nice. So many students are engaged...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is like pottery. Spinning on the wheel, he is designing the ornaments for the crown. Each doll of the demigods has a different crown. That's how they make them, on a spinning wheel just like a potter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are devising their own way. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is part of the Universal Form exhibit. This is Mahā-Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, lying down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very big. He's bigger than a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And this will be the Universal Form. He will have many heads and many arms. And with the controlling the lighting, His image will appear in mirrors on the ceiling and on the walls, so everywhere you look you'll see Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughs) All-pervading. It is very, very good improvement, encouraging. People will enjoy this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And He is lying on Śeṣa. This exhibit is so spectacular, this Universal Form. It is more impressive than anything, I think, in America, because at a certain point there is even a machine which makes different fragrances in the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can invite this opposition cult to see what we are doing. "Why you are after us," ask, "like the barking dog? There is good use. It is the highest culture." Make some compromise: "Why you are after simply spoiling? Don't you want advancement in culture and knowledge? Why you are so envious?" Just try to bring the leaders, that "What is use? You also join. It is a culture. There is no need of repressing us. We are serious to introduce a new culture for the benefit of the whole nation. Why don't you study this? Do you mean to say we are publishing books only, all sentiment, brainwash, and people are purchasing?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They cannot accuse us of brainwashing when we have so much artwork and publishing work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "We are giving culture, art, scientific knowledge. You are accusing. It is good for your nation. Think nationalwise what we are doing. We are not fools. They are also educated. They are coming from respectable family. Why you say that we have become befooled, brainwashed? We are not so fool that I shall be brainwashed by some Indian." Try to make compromise before them. Actually, this is a great culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These are the heads for the Śeṣa-naga of this Mahā-Viṣṇu exhibit. They are made from rubber and they have all the details.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span> How rubber you make mold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They do, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the benefit of rubber?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It has something to do with the curves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. In clay, it cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They started manufacturing it, at a time. That's what they used. This is a doll of Kṛṣṇa speaking to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Nobody can think it is doll. How many men are engaged?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think thirty devotees. That includes all the carpenters and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are becoming expert so that in future many other also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a doll of Lord Caitanya. That devotee is Ādideva. He was here, in India studying with Bharadrāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I simply see how the devotees are engaged in so nice occupation. This painting, this taking, thinking of Caitanya, thinking of Kṛṣṇa-this is Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is... Nobody can deny. When he's working in this way he cannot think of other way. That will elevate him, simply by thinking. <span class="Italic">Man-manā.</span> He'll derive greatest benefit. He'll become devotee. He'll get liberation from this material world simply by doing that. It is so nice. So in all our centers have this doll exhibit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is Lord Nityānanda. Very blissful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nitāi guṇa mani āmāra nitāi-guṇa mani, āmiya premera bandha vasala ayantu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These little dolls are Gandharvas. There will be over two hundred of them in the Universal Form exhibit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is the girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is one of the doll makers' wives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are the small?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Those are the Gandharvas. Each Gandharva... There are hundreds of them. They have their own outfit, different colored dresses and different ornaments, all made by hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So small?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. Because there are hundreds of them. But in the mirrors there will be millions of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Filling the whole sky and all directions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. So encourage them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is inside one of the exhibits. This is part of the wall and this is a scene of the phalanxes at Kurukṣetra, and then behind them and above, there is this painting, and it is like a curve. In the middle will be Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna on the chariot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughs) Very nice. People will so much appreciate it. Yes. They've never seen. From artistic point of view, it should be rewarded by government. And they are prosecuting us. This... What injustice... So many young men, they're exhibiting their talents in this art, and they are trying to harass us. What is this government? Put this matter before this government, that "Just see, your lordships, we are presenting culture, religion, knowledge, philosophy, art, and they are trying to condemn us. Do you think it is all right?" Simply ask. "It was never known in this country. And it is worthy. We are the first-class nation in the world, and we are still giving something more of our talent. Instead of encouraging government help, we have to suffer this harassment. Do you think it is justice?" Just put before him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is like you wrote in that letter to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: "They did not mind when the children were hippies, taking drugs, having prostitutes. But now that they have joined Hare Kṛṣṇa, now they are kidnapping you. They did not protest formerly when they were engaged in all sinful life. Now they are completely pure. Now they are complaining."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Now their children are afraid of sinful life, and they think it's brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a devotee making part of the armor for Arjuna. Each time they make an outfit, they do a very careful drawing. Then from the drawing, they make the actual equipment or armor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how devotedly he is working. That is the..., that "I am..." How devotedly he is working. That will elevate him. He's very attentively serving Kṛṣṇa. This is advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are working, minimum, twelve hours daily just on the dolls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They do not become tired. Kṛṣṇa conscious work is so nice, nobody becomes tired. He wants to do more. <span class="Italic">Duralage hurahuri.</span> (?) Competition. This is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is one devotee who is painting dolls of the demigods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiye, aiye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, these people come from Muscat. That's where I went last month. [break] (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...supervises all the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he should be engaged for propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For every exhibit Bharadrāja has to make a complete drawing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife is also helping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> She is doing the sewing for the clothing. The whole show will be finished before Māyāpura, and Bharadrāja is coming for the festival. Then right after the festival we will go back to Los Angeles and have the grand opening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When it is finished, then we'll take color pictures and send them in case you're still in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By the month of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It could be April. The grand opening, I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may go there some time. From London to Los Angeles there is direct plane. Takes about ten hours, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ten hours at least. Los Angeles to New York is five and a half, and New York to London another five hours, six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or in this way, about twelve hours, via...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Too long a flight, I think. It would be better... It's too long a flight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That directly from London to... That is the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Too long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Too long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Usually stopover in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, another northern flight from Paris and from London it goes directly to Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, it's possible but it's very uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (sic:) Unstoppage, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Nonstop. I flew from London to Delhi nonstop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is eight hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Eight hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them oppose. You do your duty. Introduce this Vedic culture in your country. It will be... In future they will appreciate. There will be history how Vedic culture was... And the whole nation will be benefited-from material side. And spiritual side there will be..., what to speak of? These literatures, this art, this strength,(?) this philosophy... Everything wonderful. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...involved in some political activity, we must follow his example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. There is no doubt about it. We shall follow strictly to politic, economy, sociology, philosophy, religion, art, culture, everything. So we are not only for Hare Kṛṣṇa. Of course, Hare Kṛṣṇa is ultimate. That is..., includes everything. But we should never say that politics is not our field. Why not? Kṛṣṇa took part. Kṛṣṇa instructs everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The whole war of Kurukṣetra was just so Kṛṣṇa's devotees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It was designed by Kṛṣṇa. But the idea was to kill. "Call them all together here and kill them. <span class="Italic">Bas,</span> finished, all the demons finished." This is Kṛṣṇa. "Instead of killing them separately, call them here and kill. Finished." Like slaughterhouse. It was a slaughterhouse for the demons. "Call them and kill them. <span class="Italic">Bas,</span> finished." <span class="Italic">Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin:</span> "It is all my design. Even if you do not fight, they are not going back to their home. They must be killed." This is Kṛṣṇa's plan. "You simply take the credit. That's all. It is all My design. You are My devotee. I want to give you this credit. Otherwise without your help they are already killed." So... Kṛṣṇa... <span class="Italic">Paritrāṇāya...</span> He has got two business. <span class="Italic">Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is another side of His business.
