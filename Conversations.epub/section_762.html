<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...no taste, no vitamin, and still they eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can everything. They have canned food, canned fruits, canned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, I have seen. Eating and remnants, it is kept in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, put in the refrigerator. And then you cook it up again with fresh foods, mixing together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is it all right if he keeps it in there and then he puts some on the plate when taking? He puts on the plate when taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know whether it is all right, but it is not all right that you eat and keep it. This is not all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He takes it from there and puts it on the plate before you eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodā-nandana:</span> He keeps the salt in a separate bowl. When you require it he will give you only as much as you require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> That's why the bowl is there. That's what I intended to do, but I have to keep it away from the table.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The principle should be that you should not leave remnants of food. As soon as it is used, it should not be used more. Otherwise it is not possible to give up. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> I am eating something not very superior, but if I get the chance of eating something superior, then I give up this inferior. So there is no question of making it vacant or void. To fill up the place with better thing.... So when you think of Kṛṣṇa, then you forget <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Otherwise you are entrapped with <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Why Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto</span>? <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante.</span> This is wanted. As soon as you become <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣī,</span> then it becomes difficult. Where is that knife? Give me one <span class="Italic">amroot</span>(?). Cut into pieces and get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think these are from the local..., growing here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we should be very careful, that we should think of Kṛṣṇa only, not of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> in everything. No more strength. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">. Avismṛti-kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ kṣinoty abhadrāṇi.</span> We are in the <span class="Italic">abhadra, māyā.</span> But <span class="Italic">avismṛti-kṛṣṇa-padaravindayoḥ kṣiṇoti.</span> The thinking of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will gradually finish. <span class="Italic">Avismṛiti-kṛṣṇa-padaravindayoḥ kṣiṇoti...</span> No, no, I said that you give these pieces, little, little. I'll do it myself. These pieces, this <span class="Italic">amroot</span>(?), yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> This. I'll give it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So no <span class="Italic">vismṛti. Avismṛti. Vismṛti</span> is ignorance. <span class="Italic">Avismṛti.</span></div>
