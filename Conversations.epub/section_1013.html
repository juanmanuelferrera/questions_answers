<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Somebody came and said that six hundred people Janmāṣṭamī night.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was surprised myself that six hundred people on Janmāṣṭamī night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They were everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that nonsense who came and said this? Who is that rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a thirteen-year-old boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You believe the boy? He's authority. Here you take the information. Why did you believe the boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, He wasn't here. He just told me last night. I asked him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how did you believe that boy? Five hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was very surprised myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that so many people come, even in ordinary years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They were sitting everywhere, even on the balconies and in the scaffolding. They were everywhere. Very crowded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The press and the television people came? Every year the television comes. They televise this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The Telenews.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was surprised when I heard five hundred. They boycotted or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> For the <span class="Italic">abhiṣeka</span> ceremony, that lasted about an hour, up till one o'clock, and everyone remained. There were thousands of people. They were just everywhere around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will give you one <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-śilā.</span> So as it is being worshiped in Māyāpura, it should be worshiped in Bombay also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want to start it now or in the new temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now. <span class="Italic">Śālagrāma-śilā.</span> It is not difficult. You have seen <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-śilā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you'll take it and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I'm going back tomorrow night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can take it. So what other news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What other news, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, now the festival is over, all the holidays are gone, so there's a big crew of people working now. It goes very fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> And we're putting in the walls of your room. We have started...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the length and breadth of my room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, it has different shapes. It's difficult to say. But the main room, the sitting room, is about, altogether, about 900 square foot. (loud cracking sound)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, this business is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mahāṁśa went down and stopped it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone can go, but the business will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> So that is your sitting room. Then you have a bedroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the sitting room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is about 900, 850 square foot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight hundred means length and breadth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Because it consists of three rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So people were enthusiastic to come to our festival?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Oh, yes, very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> And this place, when it is finished, it will be the most popular temple in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It's already the biggest. So this is the building, (unfolding plans) and these three rooms-this is 32 by 32-is your sitting room where you can receive people. Then here is your bedroom, and here is the secretary room, here is kitchen, and here is servant room. So personally you have this, four rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> This is the elevator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Then this is the entry where the people can wait in case many people are there. Here's the secretary. This is the kitchen and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Bathroom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is... That is... Like those things come out here. That is all connected with the room. So your bathroom, you have one toilet here and one shower here, each side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> This is very nice, quite big. Then on the roof you have practically the whole roof plus a room in the middle. Here is a room on the roof, the next slide, room here, and then you have just a nice terrace and very nice breeze.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All sides open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes this is open. Well, we have arches here, just arches. Now we are finishing for the temple the second floor slab. That should be finished at the end of the month, and then one more month, the main slab of the <span class="Italic">darśana-maṇḍapa,</span> and then we start towers, which we already started now precasting. We have rings. We make rings which we put up later, one by one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is by ring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, we make rings out of concrete and then we... With a rod we keep holes in it and then we just put them on top and it's... Because for Māyāpura, we get into Māyāpura we trying it out if that is possible to do that there, because there are so many domes. This system is very practical because you can cast at site, and then with a crane you bring it up and then it's fixed. Because this short ring, to make a tower on top of a building is very troublesome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This ring, concrete ring?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, concrete. Reinforced. Most of the rings are one foot and some, when it is straight, you make two feet. It depends. Then all the guest rooms we have marble on the floor, because that is very much liked in Bombay especially, to have marble. The halls, they are <span class="Italic">kota</span> stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is proposal to provide a bank?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. I have the area already marked out. There's about four or five banks that are very interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which bank are these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The Indian Overseas Bank. That is the bank most interested at the time now. Then the State Bank of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> State Bank of India. That is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is better. Then the Syndicate Bank and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the charges will be four rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Four or four and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So best. Whoever gives the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> And then one year in advance payment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if we get from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Of course, the location is excellent. It is... This is... There's two towers, and here is the road. Here is that, our road, going to our land in the back. Here is the main entry. Here is the temple in the back. So these two on the ground floor are meant for bank. So people can come right from here, and here is an entry. So place is the best for the bank. So they all want that place. So you think State Bank of India is the best?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, as you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I don't know very much, but Gopāla said that the Indian Overseas Bank is an upcoming bank as well as Syndicate Bank, so they may be more eager for this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Syndicate Bank is not very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I also think to have a big bank is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big bank is better. And who pays the best price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The best. And also the facilities. Now, in the floor we start tiling, the basement floor... Under the Deities there we have a basement. So there we have started the flooring, tiling, and now we have decided on all the other parts of the building, for the stone. So they promised, they guaranteed, that at the end of this year the building-that means the guesthouse-will be completed. And of course, that includes the temple. The only thing which will definitely go on is the marble work, the carving. That is a very big job. But that we can always continue. That is mainly outside work, finishing. So that we get the inside ready for the opening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ISKCON Juhu? That is sufficient address?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, this was hand-delivered. It would be nice if... I think now it is sufficient. Many letters come like that now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are famous now, Juhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> But your official letters, the name of the street is called A. B. Nyer Road. I never knew that. I thought it was the road in the back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they said Gandhi, Juhu Road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No. Now on the latest letter that I got from the government it was written A. B. Nyer Road. Maybe it was an old letter, I don't know. When we submitted the new plans for the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> building, there was a letter I had to sign about the work, that we have given to the architect, an official letter so that we can get the permission. And it was written that the plot was on the A. B. Nyer Road, our land. So I inquired, and they said, "Yes, that's the name of that road."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any signboard, A. B. Nyer Road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is only in the back near that new hotel, that Holiday Inn Hotel. This one portion says A. B. Nyer Road. So that road goes like this-here is the Juhu Market and the road goes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we go on as Hare Krishna Land, Juhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, that is... You don't have to say the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Krishna Land, Juhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. Everyone knows. It's no problem. Now, the altar of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, I sent you a picture that showed four columns-one here, one here, one here, and then the top. Here is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and here is Lalitā-Viśākhā. Those columns here, they're not in the front but they're in the back only. In front it is open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Open. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> So then that is all right to use that one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Because we need more breadth; this is different size. So that work has been started also, and it will be covered in silk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen this temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I have not gone around, but it looks very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is after your design.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. But I haven't been in Hyderabad for at least eight months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have done nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. Mahāṁśa Swami has done very nice. There's many good workers also in the south of India. We have a lot of difficulty in getting those men from Vṛndāvana sent to America for Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is he anxious to get them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, simply because they didn't speak English they delayed so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, Kīrtanānanda did not show any anxiety for that. He did not show any anxiety like that, he requires that. So why it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, at that time they wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That time wanted? That is finished now. Don't bother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> All right. Because I spent a lot of time in trying to arrange that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was not successful. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No. That work is going nice also, isn't it, flooring especially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> In New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let them do their own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They practically do everything themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is their greatness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Their men are being trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is actually the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They will be engaged always like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got marble-polishing machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. Last night I spoke with Jayapatākā Mahārāja, and he says that the land requisition will be in about two months or something. So whether we should go ahead with trying to purchase land before we wait till...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purchase land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, that particular area where the main temple will come, we need about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us wait.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Let us wait. So can I start in the meantime to develop the plans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> To contact engineers and everything? Now, if I have to pay some money for that type of work, do I take it from the Bombay...? It is not much, but some money is there, some expense is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... [break] ...immediately... You have waited. Why not wait till the reception is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I have some people, they do practically things for free. They work on it. But they only do that because they know in the future we're going to do it. So if there is too much delay, they may lose faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Delay? But that's a fact. Unless government gives us land... [break] ...but we... We are not Kṛṣṇa. But if we remain Kṛṣṇa conscious Vaiṣṇavas, then our position is strong, If there is slackness, then they will come to kill us. That we have to see. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari' prabhu jīve śikhāilā.</span> Our behavior should be very clear. "Caesar's wife must be above suspicion." Then it will be... This Aghāsura, Bakāsura, will come and... In the beginning there was Aghāsura, Pūtanā. That Devānanda, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Film," he wanted to do some harm. And he is gone, finished. Nobody talks of Devānanda. They talk of our movement. So if you remain strong in your spiritual activities, these Aghāsura, Bakāsura will come, go. But we should take precaution and counteract to reduce them. Real strength will remain from Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma's strength. Balarāma. Balarāma means strength. <span class="Italic">Nāyam ātmā bala hīna na labhyaḥ.(?)</span> If you are not supported by Balarāma, then it is not possible. So we have got our Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple. Now in Europe we have got Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Which place? Outside? The farm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Exactly like Vṛndāvana, I heard. The Deities are exactly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nitāi-Gaura and Balarāma. <span class="Italic">Brajendra-nandana jei kṛṣṇa, śaci-suta haila sei:</span> "He is now Śacī-suta." <span class="Italic">Balarāma haila nitāi:</span> "And Balarāma has become Nitāi." That's all. These two brothers. And devotees are very nice. So if our devotees remain... Two hundred devotees there are. And they are taking <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> on the open lawn. Very nice. Presently they are growing vegetables sufficient for their consumption and for the Paris temple. Fresh, nice vegetables. Flowers, grains also they have got. Barley and wheat. Milk also. Their own cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So if there is milk, there is food grain, there is vegetable, so what do you want more? Enough we can grow. They have got two hundred acres of land. Some portion of the land they are utilizing. That is becoming sufficient for them. And if they grow the whole land, they can make good trade. Just like in Philadelphia they are producing so much milk, they are selling outside fifteen hundred dollars per month. Fifteen hundred dollars, how much it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fourteen thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Twelve thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their income. Philadelphia they have organized very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Port Royal farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this Paramānanda, he is expert. He's very expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was in New Vrindaban before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So he could not keep in line with Kīrtanānanda. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I thought he was in New York farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is the New York farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's in Philadelphia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, I heard it is very good there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife is... They are making...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Satyabhāmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭis.</span> When she brought, it was so thick. And "How shall I eat this?" But when I ate it was so nice. Soft and sweet. I ate everything.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe she should come here to cook for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, maybe. No, they are very happy. All the boys and girls are very happy. Sit down. So that I want, that I live happily and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. We don't want unnecessary luxury. <span class="Italic">Anartha. Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt. Anartha</span> should be reduced, nil, bare necessities. <span class="Italic">Anartha...</span> Just like this material thing we require for preaching. That is not <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> But when it is used for sense gratification, that is <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> Anything for sense gratification, that is unwanted, <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> And anything for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Anukūla.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anukūla. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> So whatever we are using, that is not material. It is all spiritual. So what are these? So... <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> Sunday? (?)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. In Simla and Nanital everyone leaves after June.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> But after the rainy season?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, in October again they go back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rainy season is bad on the whole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That place. But the rest of the year it's excellent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That all right.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if it is nice, we shall take it. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It is beautiful. It's very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's near Bombay. So if you can go and come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bombay is going to be so big when the building is completed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It's on a hill, but the land is flat so you can cultivate it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he wants us to develop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, we develop. We shall spend <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> three <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> as you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he wants us to give him a proposal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> And it has been... They have been doing agriculture before there, so it's in very good state. You don't have to do much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then we shall take it. What is use of waiting? He has seen already. Take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no, he wanted you to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, we shall go in October. We shall go. So when Saurabha has seen, that is my seeing. You give me a site plan. And we shall take it and develop it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...and then come back. Then we don't have to send them to America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...because of being sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We need a place-health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda wrote, he wrote that to me last year, to get a Hill Station...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The Mahabaleswar(?) is well known. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They have nice cows there, nice vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Oh, yes. Everywhere... What is the name of that root we ate on <span class="Italic">ekādaśī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So take it and develop according to your plan. Develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It's a place known for strawberry cultivation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think will be the expenditure to develop it into a nice place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> For agriculture I can't say, but according to me, it is all level. They have leveled everything out. It's like terrace. It's just... We can start growing anything there-potatoes, grains, strawberries, fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now for residential quarter there is already bungalow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> There is a bungalow with four big... It's a big bungalow. And stone is available there, just like here in Hyderabad. At the back of the land it's like a rocky area. One small portion that is so much stone there available, so you can just build from the stone anything. The land can be used for the cement, instead of cement. So very cheap you can build there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, it depends how many devotees are going to stay. But for a farm, I think ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Say ten rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Ten rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> from Bombay could be moved over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> can live, go to the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they can go from Bombay to there. They can cultivate our farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> For sixty thousand rupees we can build sufficient accommodation, and then the rest we need...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can spend up to one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> and make more rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. And when you come there the house is sufficient for you to stay. It's very nice. Big rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall go in October.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> There's three big wells available. Three big wells are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wells? Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Three. And according to me, these people, they also want to invest money in that project. The people themselves, they also want to give money for developing. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. They want to turn it over to us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...if we give them guarantee that we will develop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we shall do. You guarantee that. Decision is made. So you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And from what I've heard, this Malhotra is a very-Girirāja told me-very, very nice man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is not going to... He's a very, very rich man himself, so he's not really trying to cheat us or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That decision is made. It is a very well known place, Mahabaleswar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Mahabaleswar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Just on the other side of the plateau you have that RMA, ARA?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think Mahabaleswar is also the summer capital of Mahara... All the government ministers have been meeting there. And this Bhogilal Patel's son, he was saying that he knows all the big people there. Sītā, Rāma, (indistinct) he's the chairman of the local municipality...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we must have a big temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> MRA? It's a moral institute. It's very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> MRA?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> MRA, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Moral...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Moral Re-armament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It's just on the other side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is still existing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Oh, yes. The building is excellent, but nothing is going on. Only twice a year they have a meeting. But it's very well built.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their propaganda is that "You do sinful. You do whatever you like. You simply admit. Confession. Then you'll be..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Atone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is morality. "You commit immorality as much as you like. You simply admit it. Then it's right" (indistinct) This is their propaganda. They do not want to stop immorality. "You do, and don't hide it-you admit." But persons are so shameless that they will continually do, and they have no shamefulness to hide even. That is the Christian theory, that "Our religion is so... Maybe we are unable to remain without any sin. Christ will excuse us." Is it not? This is going on. This is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They're also criticized a lot there. They have been criticized a lot there locally. People, they think they are CIA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No. The MRA. Because they have big meetings twice a year only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The MRA, they are Americans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. Most are Europeans, Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This movement was started by President Eisenhower with the help of a Christian priest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Now the son of Gandhi, he is the main president...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The son of Mahatma Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shri Ramdal(?) Gandhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> He's the head man of that institute there. And then some very big European industrialist they are also involved. They've spent two <span class="Italic">crores</span> of rupees on that complex. It's very well maintained also. I went into the building. It's excellent. But there is nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Nobody. [break] So it is immediately cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The door is ready, so when you go for a bath...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he can come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Now he can come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mahāṁśa Swami is nicely doing (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's very sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And everyone likes him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. He's very popular with the life members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has no enemy. Nobody has complained against him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's very even-tempered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Neither he has complained against anybody. He does not complain, and nobody complains against him. His mother was very much sorry. Now she is very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He joined in the West?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is Parsee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's not Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is Indian. India, there is Parsee community. Indian Parsee means that originally they come from Iran. They are Iranian. But on account of Muhammadans forcibly standing within way... Aurangzeb came. Muhammadans they came, they fled from Iran and took shelter in the western part of India. They took shelter in Gujarat. Persia... I think Iran was known as Persia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. At least that area, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are known as Parsee. In their ritualistic ceremonies some (indistinct) do with women... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. I saw all the women, they keep themselves covered and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sari?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Most of them were wearing trousers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Parsees are well known for saris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Iran, though, I saw most of the women wear... Under those black veils they were actually wearing trousers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not wearing saris? (pause) We have no problems except this immigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's the main thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise we have no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> By the time they've finished all their investigations, they'll... Eventually they'll have to let us come. At least maybe in Calcutta it will be easier. In Calcutta, with the authorities there, if we get this... If we start building Māyāpura, then they'll be a lot more lenient than they've been before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. They've taken the best area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this leg swelling is gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. It only came when we were in Iran because of the altitude. Then, as soon as we left, it went away again. That doctor in New York, he said it was because when your blood pressure goes up, then it's difficult for the heart to pump. So then fluid forms in the leg because of the bad blood circulation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was his diagnosis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. So as soon as we came... Like in New Vrindaban, a little bit high, then again it changes over. But then, as soon as we left, then it stopped again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then this Mahabaleswar will not be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. If it's very high, the altitude will not be so good. As soon as we arrived in Iran, immediately the next day the swelling was there. I don't know how high this will be, but New Vrindaban is not so high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes? (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think someone said about 1200 feet, not very much. But that may be because the atmosphere in the hills is a little rarified as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I had vision of (indistinct)... More than going to the hill (indistinct). It is higher than sea level anyway... Therefore the northern portion of India is called upper. It is very higher than the sea level. It is called upper because it is much higher, very high from the ocean. But I was... Vṛndāvana is also that part of (indistinct). Only Bengal is not upper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, it's low.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is near the sea, so... (end)</div>
