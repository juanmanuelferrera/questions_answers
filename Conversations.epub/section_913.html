<div class="Purp-para">(some machinery in the shop makes it difficult to hear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (announces in microphone:) Prabhupāda visits the marble shop. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is a cutting table Śrīla Prabhupāda, here's is a diamond saw. When you cut marble you have to use water, so it automatically shoots water out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You can make the cut if you want to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the marble? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is a marble base, this is what they cut on. Just to make it flat, it has to be a perfectly flat table. This is part of the floor for your study room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. This is marble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, this is all marble, but it is glued together in little pieces. Like inlaid. And this is the polishing room. [break] Take the rough marble and make it shine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have spent so much money. What is the price of this machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Well, there was a man, he was going out of business in Pittsburg, and I got a great deal of marble and all the machinery and everything for nine thousand dollars. It is very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Do you know how to work? No. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That is a heater, it's burning wood. (break to walking outside, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> going on.) ...growing mung beans in this little field over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (<span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> ended, conversation in car now) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> ...horse? What do they do, plowing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. They do some plowing, they do some pulling wagons. Mostly they are used in the woods for logging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. This land is very nice. For mung beans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, those are all mung beans up there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Children:</span> Haribol!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Kṛṣṇa Balarāma used to practice race with the birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now our boys are racing with the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is childish game. This nature is there in Kṛṣṇa. This is their only school building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is not ours. This was an old school building, public school, but that is not our building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not our?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Not ours. [break] ...looks like it might clear today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. How these logs will be used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And you have to cut into planks? No. Or beams?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cylinder? Gas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Gas. (end)</div>
