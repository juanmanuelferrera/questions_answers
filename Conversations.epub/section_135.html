<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's the capital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Tallahassee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Miami is the capital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No. Miami is a big tourist city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> It's all tourist, the whole place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's an Indian fellow in the San Francisco temple. He comes very often. He's a student, and his name is Vinode.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vinode.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. And he helps us cook <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And he cooks in the kitchen and oh, he says, "Kṛṣṇa is my only life." He says he was so happy to find a temple here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He mentioned to me that he's married and that he has a child in India. And he asked, "Oh, were you married?" And I said, "No. My wife was taken away." And he came over and he hugged me. "Oh," he said, "you are so lucky." (laughter) He hugged me. He said, "Oh, you are so lucky."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckling) There is a Tulasī das poetry, <span class="Italic">din ka ḍākinī rat ka bhāginī gargara bhāginī cuṣe.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāginī.</span> Tulasī das had very good, beautiful wife, and he was very much attached to her. So the system is that after the girl is staying with her husband... Because young girls, very minor age, they were married, say, ten years, nine years, twelve years. But they're allowed to live with husband, say, after thirteen years or fourteen years, when she has attained puberty. So the system is six months father house and six months husband. In this way, going and coming. But when she is elderly she can remain continually with her ...but in the beginning... Because after all, she is girl, so she cannot tolerate the separation from father and mother. So six months here, six months... So Tulasī das, as soon as the, his father-in-law will come to take his daughter, he won't allow. He won't allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, he's so attached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "She'll go later on. She'll go." So he went back. The father used to..., went back. In this way, several times. Then it was agreed that the girl would go there, father's house, and the father took the girl in the morning, and in the evening Tulasī dāsa went there. (laughs) His wife chastised, "You are so rascal fool that I have come this morning and you have, evening you are here? You have so much attachment for the skin?" Just like husband and wife talking. That struck him very badly, and he immediately left that place and went to... Left home for good. Yes. And that was the initiation that he took up writing about Rāma. That is Tulasī dāsa's life. Just being, I mean to say, hurt by the words of wife, that "I love her,"... Later on he understood, "Yes, she is right. So why should I be so much attached?" She uttered this (indistinct), "If you have got so much attachment for this skin and bone; if you had so much attachment for Rāma then your life would have been different." So he took it seriously. "Why not attachment for Rāma?" So he became a great devotee of Rāma, Tulasī das. His book, <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa.</span> "Thinking always of Rāma," that is his book. It is very famous book, and that is the only important literature in the Hindi language, <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa.</span> It is very popular in India. Village to village. Practically Gītā Press has flourished simply by selling the <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa</span> and <span class="Italic">Gītā. Gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa.</span> Two books. Millions of books they print and sell, this <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So he has written that <span class="Italic">din ka dakini.</span> In the daytime she is just like what is called, witches. Witch? Witch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Witch, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ḍākinī.</span> And <span class="Italic">rat ka bhāginī.</span> At night she is tigress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> She's what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Tigress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tigress. At daytime she is witches. Witch or witches?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Witch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Witch. And at night she is tigress. So that is the nature of woman. But the world is so made that everyone is keeping such tigress. (laughs heartily) <span class="Italic">Din ka ḍākinī rat ka bhāginī.</span> (Hindi) Every moment she is sucking blood. She is such a dangerous tigress. Every moment sucking blood. But (Hindi) the people, the world, people of the world has gone so crazy that each one is keeping one tigress. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Right in the home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Tulasī dāsa's remark. So in many passages of his poetry he has not done very justice to woman. And another poetry, he writes, <span class="Italic">dhol guṇār śūdra narī. Dhol guṇār śūdra narī ihe sab śaśan ke adhikārī.</span>(?)<span class="Italic"> Dhol guṇār paśu śūdra narī, ihe sab śaśan ke adhikārī. Dhol, dhol</span> means drum, <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga. Gunar, guṇār</span> means... What is called English? A fool, fool. Illiterate fool, what is one word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Buffoon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe buffoon. Buffoon is sometimes troublesome. But <span class="Italic">guṇār</span> means he doesn't understand very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Dullard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dull, dull. <span class="Italic">Dhol guṇār, dhol</span> means drum and <span class="Italic">guṇār</span> means dull. <span class="Italic">Śūdra,</span> and the laborer class. Three. <span class="Italic">Dhol, guṇār, śūdra,</span> and <span class="Italic">paśu,</span> household animals, just like cows, dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Pet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pet, like that. <span class="Italic">Dhol guṇār śūdra paśu</span> and <span class="Italic">narī. Nari</span> means woman. (laughs) Just see. He has classified the <span class="Italic">narī</span> amongst these class, <span class="Italic">dhol, guṇār, śūdra, paśu, narī. Ihe sab śaśan ke adhikārī. Sasan ke adhikārī</span> means all these are subjected for punishment. And what about the guest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Govinda dāsī:</span> Oh, the guest? It's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">śaśan ke adhikārī</span> means they should be punished. (laughs) Punished means, just like <span class="Italic">dhol,</span> when the, I mean to say, sound is not very hard, dag-dag, if you beat it on the border, then it comes to be nice tune. Similarly, <span class="Italic">paśu,</span> animals, if you request, "My dear dog, please do not go there." Hut! (laughter) "No, my dear dog." Hut! This is the way.(?) Similarly, woman. If you become lenient, then she will be troublesome. So in India still, in villages, whenever there is some quarrel between husband wife, the husband beats and she is tamed. (laughs) In civilized society, "Oh, you have done this?" Immediately some criminal case. But in uncivilized society they don't care for court or civilized way of... <span class="Italic">Kicharī.</span> (<span class="Italic">prasādam</span> being served)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rayarama:</span> Swamiji, Janārdana told me that from Vedic sources, you drew some conclusion that there are different universes visible? The stars are different universes? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rayarama:</span> So each star is a different universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Begin, begin. (eating) Yes. Gargamuni, you distribute this <span class="Italic">purī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Made some curry. (everyone eating for a long time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before Kṛṣṇa consciousness, was there any <span class="Italic">purī</span> manufactured here? No. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. None of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> When I first came to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I'd only been coming I think maybe two days to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then Mukunda had his wedding. Oh, that hooked me. Nice wedding and nice feasting. I was hooked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāyarāma:</span> That was the day after our initiations. They initiated the night before. We had two days feasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I came into San Francisco looking for a spiritual teacher and I came to <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and I never left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I think that's what hooked all of us. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāde sarva-duhkhānāṁ hanir asyopajāyate.</span> (pause) Thank you. Govinda dāsī has become very good housewife. Yes. (pause) Rāyarāma, come. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa baṛo doyāmoy koribāre jihvā jay sva-prasād-anna dilo bhāi.</span> No more. (end)</div>
