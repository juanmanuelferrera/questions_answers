<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...by taking birth of any, whether the tree is taking birth or the ant is taking birth and the fish is taking birth. Everywhere, living entities, they are taking birth, that's all. And they are dying also. And between birth and death there is disease and old age. So during birth one cannot understand, because there is unconscious stage. So even the fetus is killed, it cannot under..., because fully unconscious stage. And there is life undoubtedly; otherwise how the fetus all of a sudden gets life? But these <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> cannot see it. Here in this matter there is no life; therefore many thousands of years, if you kill, it will never show any symptom of life. But if there is life, at a time it will come to consciousness. Just like fainted man is lying like a dead man, but he is not dead. There is life. It is fainted, unconscious state. So because there is life, he may lie down in that unconscious state for two, three hours; again he'll come. It is common sense. And if a log, wood log, is lying flat, will it come to life, anything? But because these <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> they are taking that "Fetus has no life. Kill it, finish it and eat it." It is going on. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I imagined that it would soon go on, on a mass scale, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it will go, because they are becoming more <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> There is no intelligence. Therefore I say that we are giving this intelligence. This is the only movement to make these <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> intelligent. This is the only movement. Otherwise they are becoming more and more and more and more <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> So under the circumstances, if we also become <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> then who will make the other <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> intelligent? That is my point. There are so many things. I'll begin this, I mean to say, recitation of Sixth Canto. There are so many nice instructions. So this... [break]...even they are kept to remain as <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> all other so-called attempts... There are many other attempts for awakening the human society to right platform, but their basic principle is wrong. They cannot do it. It is not possible. (pause) So there is no <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yeah. At seven. The <span class="Italic">āratika</span> is at seven. Ten minutes. Now it's <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this movement should be pushed very vigorously. And so far, we have become successful. And enemies will be always, as soon as there is something good. That is the way of material world. Even Kṛṣṇa had enemies, what to speak of us. Eh? So many enemies, but He was powerful; He killed all them. Nobody could kill Him, but there was attempt to kill Him from the very beginning of His birth. He had so many enemies. As soon as Kaṁsa heard that his sister is now newly married, but as soon as there was some foretelling, "Ah, you are taking care of your sister so nicely. The eighth child of this sister will kill you." "Oh, where is your child? Where is pregnancy?" Nothing. He became angry. "So why wait for eighth child? Kill my sister." Long, long before taking birth of Kṛṣṇa, the mother was to be killed. This is the position of this material world. So he became so bad that "My sister..." He did not consider that "She is my sister, and she is just newly married. Where is pregnancy? Where is child? And that is the eighth child, and what will happen after that?" No consideration. Immediately, "Kill him, kill her." This is the position. So we are instructing: no intoxication. So those who are flourishing by selling cigarettes and wine and liquor, they do not... "Immediately kill him." Oh, yes, in this way. "If they, the movement goes and becomes very strong, then our business will be lost. Kill him." So naturally they will be enemies. The same thing, the Kaṁsa saw that "This my sister, now she is married. So although it will take some long time, but here is the cause." So they are thinking like that. No meat-eating, then all slaughterhouses will be closed: "They're enemy." Although there is no such symptom that slaughterhouse is going to be closed, but they'll think like that. They'll think like that, the same way. There is no ex... [break] ...pregnancy, first, second, third, then eighth, and the child will go, take birth and... They are thinking like that. So the modern civilization, we are everyone saying. Because you have forbidden: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling. The whole Western world living on these four pillars. Just see our position. And the same conscious way, everyone is thinking, "If this movement goes on, then how all these nightclubs will go on? How all breweries will go on? How all slaughterhouse will go on, cigarette factories will go on?" This is all foolish. So you cannot expect that we will get more, many friends. That is not possible, because the world is full of Kaṁsas, demons. So we have to struggle and... In the face of so many obstacles we have come to this standard that there is one Hare Kṛṣṇa movement; it is very dangerous to the modern way of life. That much is great, advance. They're feeling the pulse. Now when they are meeting, state obstacles. Everywhere we are meeting obstacles. In Singapore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We went to the airport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And practically they didn't even want to let us stay in the airport. We had to stay there only for four hours to catch the next flight. They are so much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our position. Gradually they will show Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. In India also, although India's... They will want to crush down this movement. So this will be up to Him. Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's movement, the same thing. And Kṛṣṇa was attempted to be killed by Kaṁsa class of men and his company, the demons. So it will be there; it is already there. Don't be disappointed, because that is the meaning that it is successful. Kṛṣṇa's favor is there, because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's movement is not different, identical. So as Kṛṣṇa was attempted to be killed, many, many years before He appeared... At eighth child, if the mother produces child yearly, still ten years, eight years before His birth, the mother was to be attempted to be killed. So there may be attempt like that. And Lord Jesus Christ was killed. So they may kill me also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I don't think that is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say, I am not so important man. But it is the, this is the way of the law. If we become weak by factioning, then that is not good. We must be strong and... But you do not expect that this movement will be accepted. In India the so-called yogis, Rama Krishna Mission-they are also being afraid of. There are so many... But if we remain sincere, even we are feeble, new-born, nobody can kill us. That is a fact. Just like Kṛṣṇa when He was three months old, attempt was made by Putanā to kill Him, but the Putanā was killed. A big demon, gigantic, six miles long, and what is killed by a small child playing on the..., sucking breast and sucking life. That is Kṛṣṇa. So the other day I have explained that by guru, he is accepted as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You have typed it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go on. Yes,<span class="Italic"> arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matiḥ. Narakī,</span> if anyone thinks <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha,</span> the Deities as made of stone, made of earth, or made of something material, and guru, the spiritual master, "He is an ordinary man"-these are forbidden. So why guru is to be considered <span class="Italic">sākṣād dharitvena samasta-śāstrair **,</span> exactly (like) the Supreme Personality of Godhead? That reason is given there. That reason is that he is giving the Kṛṣṇa knowledge; therefore he is as good as Kṛṣṇa. Even though his family members or his friend thinking, "Oh, he has now become guru," still he should be considered the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That reason also given there, that even Kṛṣṇa was taken as ordinary man, but does it mean that He has become ordinary? Similarly any..., our movement, it may appear just like other movement, but because the movement is giving Kṛṣṇa, that means it is as good as Kṛṣṇa. This is the example. <span class="Italic">Ajñāya haña </span>(follow the order). It may appear to others... And there are so many movements, and the hippies have taken another say(?), but it is not that. It is actually Kṛṣṇa. So long it adheres to the principle, "I'll enjoy, I'll be unaccepted(?)." Otherwise it is ordinary movement. This same man, he's guru, so long he gives the real knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. And the same man, he's ordinary man, as soon as he cannot give. Same thing, just like a stone doll, when it is worshiped according to the regulative principles-Kṛṣṇa. And the same doll, kept in the sculptor's showroom, it is stone. So if we keep our movement pure, then you are as strong as Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as you deviate from it, immediately, ordinary. This is the secret. Now it is up to us, how to keep it pure. Then no enemy can kill us. Nobody can kill you. That purity is wanted, then it will... So what is there difficulty? Their purity to kill him(?). Follow the rules and regulations, worship the Deity, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> as you have given, then you will remain as strong as Kṛṣṇa. And if we manufacture some idea also, that is no good. Kṛṣṇa cannot be manufactured; Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa. You cannot manufacture another form competitor of Kṛṣṇa. That is no good. Then failure. Just like the, your one competitor came to, even in the lifetime of Kṛṣṇa, Pauṇḍraka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With artificial four hands. You know that? (laughs) That is no (indistinct). This movement is actually the real movement to raise the human society. And if we create factions, then the movement will be less strong and will not act very (indistinct). (pause) Australian dollar question is solved with you? And this check can be deposited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it will turn out OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this dealing of the bank is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not good. I know. I complained to the bank manager also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They said their hands were tied because the specimen signature on the check...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They give me writing check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are talking? Give me writing, that this is not bona fide. Then we take this step, "Your check nonpayment: we will have to take steps." "We wanted this money; we have deposited the money there, and you are not paying. What is this?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are being inconvenienced by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "So now you have to pay the balance. We did not carry the money, took a check, and immediately pay, now you have detained it. So you give me in writing why you are not paying. Then we shall take steps. We should not be punished." Sometimes they take advantage, "Oh, he is servant(?) class, he must be fool number one." (chuckles) They think it. [break] ...no loss or commission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not on the check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Check, there is no question. They can deposit immediately in our account. It is cashier's check; it has to be cashed immediately. So did you ask about the dollars, despatching to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They said they would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no difficult, but what is rate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The rate, ah, 11.34 American cents equals one rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 11.34.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I haven't converted into how many... I can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 11.34, that is good rate. So I wish that... We should combine the work very vigorously when this (indistinct). They are just like women, equal in preaching (indistinct). You keep some women together, and they fight. The children together, they will fight. Dogs together, they will fight. Sane man, why they will fight? Where is the cause of fight? Then you are (indistinct) to become woman. Worse. This material world is such that even you keep some utensil together, when dealing, <span class="Italic">tung, tung, tung, tung, tung,</span> what to speak of individuals souls. But our cause is the common, how to push on. That soberness must be there. I can give you points, instructions, you will have to put it into shape; otherwise how it will go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can understand that Your Divine Grace does not want factions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will better the movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Sometimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it just seems there is a... The (indistinct) is that there seems to be a difference in the way Kṛṣṇa consciousness is being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Well, there's only one way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now why there should be different? The formula is there. Why there should be difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then there is someone who's not doing it properly according to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is (indistinct), that should be settled up. Suppose you are not doing properly, I can say, "This is this," do, show you how to do it other way. [break] Where is Govinda dāsī? Where is the Deity information? She is manufacturing some (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] In India, Punjab National give us 8.84.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) That's all right. Just put over (here). (indistinct) [break] That I want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That we should work together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is this (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no problem with... [break] ...as far as distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness like that, but the thing is they simply don't want to cooperate with the ISKCON movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That no one knows. They simply just don't want to mix.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we can settle up by sitting together. Why there should be difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just like in New Zealand, originally they split from ISKCON, and now gradually you are bringing them back to the same standard again, like now you're encouraging them to build a temple and install Deities. That means they have to come up to the required brahminical standard again. So why was there any need to go away in the first place? But still they won't cooperate. Now they'll have to do it their own way. This is..., that's their problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thousand. No, don't tear. It is written there, "One thousand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. There's fifties and twenties. There's one fifty note, one hundred notes, twenty notes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Usually, when they write like this, they're the same denomination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you can count, yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> There are a lot of devotees here who follow the principles but cannot completely... [break] ...shaved up, and they still wear <span class="Italic">karmī</span> clothes pretty much, but they're clean, they're devotees, and in this way they're attracting many of the local people, because they're able to relate to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They're not lowering your standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, naturally, but when they are initiated they must shave. They must keep to the standard. If one becomes initiated and he still keeps the hippie form, that does not look nice. Do you think that is all right? No, that is not good. So long they are coming as outsider, joining <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> they may have their own dress, it doesn't matter. They are coming to <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> that must be (indistinct). But when they are to be initiated, they must follow the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise they should not be initiated. It is simple thing. Let them go on chanting, taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>; we have no (indistinct). But when they are to be initiated, they must follow. This is the clear (indistinct). If you don't want to disturb them, let them come, chant, dance, take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> We have no objection. But don't recommend them for initiation unless he agrees to the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master. Where is the wrong? Where is the difficulty? You can talk with him like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I think they only feel that because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No feeling, if you..., when you are surrendering to the spiritual... <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Hari-śauri:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Enquire from him submissively..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm? Where are they? Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Enquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to submit. You cannot remain independent. That is the first condition. <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'haṁ, śiṣya. Śiṣya</span> means voluntarily accepting the rules offered by the spiritual master. That is <span class="Italic">śiṣya:</span> "Ah, yes, I agree to abide by your order." Then he becomes <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> Otherwise where is the question... "I am thinking like this, I am thinking..." So long you are thinking otherwise, you don't try to become a <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> You remain outside and you are welcome: chant, dance, take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and remain independent. There is no objection. But when you become <span class="Italic">śiṣya,</span> then you cannot remain independent. These things convince him. Then you don't become <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> Remain as friend, there is no harm. Just like so many people, they come. So if these things (indistinct). One thousand twenty, checks (indistinct). This way. What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So then part of initiation means that you're prepared to do something more than simply chant and eat <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Initiation means to follow instructions of the spiritual master. That is the first (indistinct) And if there is still hesitation to surrender to the rules and regulations, then all other (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I think it is pretty clear, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's just for clarification, that they're working, they have a store on..., a very nice store, they're distributing foodstuffs to all the other stores on the island, and they're working a lot within the society with the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> I guess. So their thinking is that "If we shave our heads and wear robes, like that, then they'll look at us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not... Because imitating. Officially don't chant. Who is prohibiting to chant? You can chant, you can dance, you can take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can they actually say that "His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is my spiritual master" if they haven't accepted all of the instructions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can one actually say that my spiritual master is such-and-such person if I am not following all of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use of following (indistinct). We have got that simple thing, you can follow. What is the use? False propaganda. Because you think that we could not accept... (indistinct) ...we are trying to follow the (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One of the differences that first sprung up between the two groups was that one group was going out when you were saying "Go out and distribute books profusely," so they were going and distributing. And they had various means of doing it. Some were not so good, but still the books were going out. Then the group that split away, they were saying, "Ah, you're disturbing the public by these methods of book distribution. We don't want..." This is what happened in Australia, the one temple in Brisbane. They became very much against the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> methods, and as a result they gave up the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> program altogether and then went to live on farms like this, and they left the temple and the temple was finished. So like this, they were saying that "We're still following Prabhupāda's instructions, but we..." But they were saying that the devotees who were distributing the books, they were not following instructions. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His Divine Grace has said that "You distribute book," and why do you say that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, their idea was that because sometimes the public is becoming disturbed by the book distribution, then therefore it's not being done correctly. So it should be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Public may disturb, but we are following our own course of action. It is not obligatory. We are requesting you, "Take this book." That is not obligatory. "If you like, you can take. If you don't like, don't take."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So what their idea was that we shall build some public relations, like you said with this store. They prefer to try to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness by public relations, give good impression, and then people will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are dictated by the public, not by the dictation of your spiritual master. Spiritual master has ordered to distribute books; you shall do that. That is obedience. Now the public may take or not take, that is public's option. But my duty is-because spiritual master has said-I must try my best. Spiritual master has not said that "You must sell so many books daily, otherwise I will reject you." He has not said that. So everyone may try his best, that's all. The public may take or not take, it doesn't matter. And if you are, want to please the public, public says that "You dance naked, I will be very happy with you, I'll give you (indistinct)." So I'll have to do that. Then what is the use of making a spiritual master? Public, they have got their whims, how to become pleased. So we are to follow all these things? We have to follow our instruction of the spiritual master. That is... (indistinct) Why to manufacture "The public will be pleased like this"? Public may or may not give you, what you can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Our success is in the spiritual master's pleasure, not the public's pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]? "You haven't got to please so many religious instructions. You simply please Me." That is Kṛṣṇa's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I don't think the devotees who factioned out were against book distribution. I think that a little bit was that some of the devotees were using very, very forceful tactics and trying to give people books and take their money, and people were becoming very offended...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> That is not what you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's all right, but don't give up the book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is what happened. The temples fell down, the devotees went away. The ones who were distributing the books went on and distributed more books, became more expert, so that the public were not so much disturbed, and still they're distributing books. But these people who factioned off are not distributing books even now, two or three years later. So it was simply actually a question of faultfinding more than earnest desire to please the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) Discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
