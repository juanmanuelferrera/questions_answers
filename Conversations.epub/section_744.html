<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...sun globe. You explain to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We can see there's life in the air, there are fishes in the water and birds in the air. And in the earth there are so many worms and crabs and things like that. We see life in these forms but why is it not true that we can see life in fire? We can't see life in fire because we haven't the experience. But because there's life in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> If you don't have the experience, it doesn't mean there's no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because there's life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because we have not experienced it doesn't mean that there's no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I have already explained. That, you'll see in big, big factories, there is fire. Flame is coming. By seeing the flame, if you think there is no life, is that not nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, you gave the example last night of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many example. You go to the Tata iron factory, from distance you'll see so many fire flames. Does it mean there is no life? That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Another point is somebody had to light the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Somebody must have lit that fire. So similarly the light of the sun, who has started that light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Somebody has started that light, that fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in this way the nonsense scientists are going on. What do you think? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So this idea of friction causing electricity, so is electricity-this electrical energy-the source of fire? That's what the scientists think sometimes too, that the lightning bolt came down and made a fire. And that was man's first experience of fire as a caveman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So where did the lightning bolt come from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How the lightning was manufactured, rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, there were some positive charges in the clouds and some negative charges in the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's alright. Who made that positive charge and negative charge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So let them manufacture lightning bolts in the Tata factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How the electricity is produced unless there is some arrangement? Just put counter-argument and argument, try to understand. You have to preach. So your argument stopped?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't know anything about this. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot... Your <span class="Italic">malador masjid(?).</span> Arguments are there, so whether there is life in the sun globe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi-discussion with Śrīla Prabhupāda and other Indian men about <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> scientists, <span class="Italic">agni,</span> and the example of the iron factory)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But the fire and the life is different in the Tata factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The fire is different from the life. The fire is produced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The fire is the same. There is fire. Fire is the same. In the life the fire is not different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, what I mean to say in the example, that the people are there and the fire is also there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So, in a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Exactly the same way. In the factory there is big fire and there are workers also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But the life is the workers not the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I mean to say, in the midst of fire, the living entity can live. That is my argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But they can't jump in the fire and live. They will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is material body. Spiritual... In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is, (it says that) it does not burn into fire, in the fire. <span class="Italic">Adāhyaḥ, adāhyaḥ.</span> So living entity is never burnt. Even if he's in the fire. So he may have a body of fire but he does not burn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But why should we accept that, because to make our factory we did not need <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> To make our factory we did not need <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> To make the factory... We have made such a nice factory for fire, so we did not need to consult <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow what he is saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's saying he built a factory but he didn't use <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who says that without <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you cannot ignite fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So why should we accept that the living entity will not die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is authority. If you do not accept, then this is the example, argument. That the factory surrounded by fire, it does not mean there is no life. From distance, you are seeing the sun from a very, very, 95 or 93 million miles away. Fiery it is undoubtedly, but it is exactly like that: that you see from a distant place, the iron factory, it is simply fiery. Your experience is from distance. You have not gone there. So the distance experience is like this, that you see there is fire, big fire, but still there are life. You have to accept this argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually it is perfectly reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In the fire there's fiery bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But then that must mean in the water there's watery bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And earth, earthy bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is God's creation. Take, take out one fish, within five minutes, he'll die. And you put yourself in the water, within five minutes you will die. But you are living entity, he is also living entity. His external body is different, your external body is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But my body is ninety percent water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> My body is ninety per cent water. The scientists say that this material body is ninety percent water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Human body. So I've got a watery body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ninety percent water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say. They are rascals. (laughter) So much bones and flesh and so many things, others. And ninety percent water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, they take a cell and they say in the cell...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They take," they... Don't quote them, they are all rascals. You come to your own reason. They say, then you accept them as authority. Then why don't you accept authority of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> rascal? You are quoting some rascals and fools, and I am quoting from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then whose quotation is favorable? "They say." And when we say, "Kṛṣṇa says," that is nothing! Just see, how foolish. "They say." These rascals, meat eaters, huh? Bachelor daddies, (laughter) they say something, that is authority. And (if) Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead says, (then) "Oh, that we cannot accept." Just see nonsense. That I... This argument I put forward with Professor Kotovsky that, "After all, we have to follow leader. So your leader is Lenin. And my leader is Kṛṣṇa. So where is the difference between the process? You have to accept some authority. Now it is to be seen whether Lenin is perfect or Kṛṣṇa is perfect. That is another thing, but you have to follow some authority. So you are stopped."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But in science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, as far as the process goes, they are very proud of the fact that there's no authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why you are following? Why you are quoting Newton? You are quoting this scientist, that scientist, why you are quoting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, Newton sat there, and saw the apple falling... <span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you don't follow authority, then why you quote so many previous scientists? What is the use of quoting if there is no authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But the trend is, because Newton speculated the law of gravity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, first of all you settle up. Don't go away from the point. (laughter) The point is that there is no need of authority. Then why you quote this scientist, that scientist? You stop this nonsense. There is no authority. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Haṁsadūta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no authority, why do you quote so many rascals? Then come to reason, argument, that's all. If you quote authority, I have got my authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So this fire... That makes sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This fire, it makes sense. That there's life in fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is argument. When you do not accept authority, there must be reason and argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But this ether thing is very troublesome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Troublesome for you! (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. You said sound is in the ether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I couldn't understand how air...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to gain that intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sound is the proof that there is ether. <span class="Italic">Śabda.</span> Now, I am talking, you are hearing. How you are hearing? Ethereal transportation. Otherwise how you can hear? I am talking here, and why you are hearing? This is ethereal. The sound is being produced, somehow or other the ether is passing, just (like) tele... What is called? Radio.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They heard, people on the earth, talking on the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So it went through the air, it went through the space, sounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The moon (astronaut) says that "There is no life." Then who is speaking? Nonsense. (laughter) They talk in the moon, and they hear from here, and "There is no life." And we have to take these authorities. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I remember once you said that we may not live in the water but that doesn't mean there's no such thing as a fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So that is also a very good argument. I remember you gave that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the air is coming from the ether, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in the air there is sound. Therefore ether is there. It is a production of the ether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So would it be beneficial to try to understand the process of production? Like the example of the earth coming from the water. Because the water evaporates, there is left over minerals and salts and all these things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And the fire producing the water from excess heat. Like in the summer season and then the monsoon comes. And fire from air, from the friction generating electric current. But the air from the ether needs an example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Air from the ether because when the air blows, you find the sound, sshhhh. That is ether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, like some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But the example's got to go the other way. From the ether comes the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you found out, example. But this is the proof there is ether within the air. That example is given many times in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Does it mean beyond the ether there's no sound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beyond the ether there is mind, there is mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There's no sound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the sound of the mind? Everyone knows you have mind, I have mind, but where is the sound of the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's subtle and the gross has no realm in the subtle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is finer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So is that example of the space, then the thinner air, and the air, and the water, and the earth, and in between electricity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The grosser, grosser...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is that a good example?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is coming from the subtle form, finer. Finer than the ether is the mind, and finer than the mind is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> it also says that because the universal form desired to hear, that sound was created and then the organ for hearing. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like from ether, sound is created. <span class="Italic">Śabda, sparśa. Śabda, sparśa, rūpa, rasa, gandhaḥ,</span> these are the five <span class="Italic">parmatra</span> (?), object of sense perception. <span class="Italic">Budh, pañca parmatra,</span> ten senses, the mind, and three modes, the material nature. This is the ingredient of the whole creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the basic element is the soul's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Basic element is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And then the spirit soul's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And Kṛṣṇa fulfills everyone's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> By manipulating the energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the most subtle form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is also... The living entity is creating different body for different enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But he can't do it without Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, he is subordinate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Just like our hair grows, but we don't know how it's happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is sanctioned. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> Everything from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is the most subtle form of creation the desire of the living entity to enjoy this material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And then Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supplies ingredients. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So that desire, that is equivalent, or is that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A child wants to play, and the father and mother gives the toys for that play. So without getting help from the father and mother, the child cannot enjoy. Similarly, we may desire but unless Kṛṣṇa helps us we cannot fulfill our desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is desire a function of consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless there is desire, how it is living? It is dead body. Stone, stone has no desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The spirit soul is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, spirit soul is described as superior energy. He desires and he manipulates the matter. <span class="Italic">Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat</span> [Bg. 7.5]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's very logical, step by step by step by step. Actually when it's seen from the point of view of the desire of the living entity, it makes perfect sense because he's got these senses and the sound, and then in order to hear, there has to be a vehicle for the sound, and then there has to be an instrument. And then in order to touch there has to be the vehicle and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So therefore, from that point of view, it's very logical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the point, you have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Trying to do it the other way is impossible. From the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> Empirical process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I don't know if that's the right word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Inductive reasoning? Deductive reasoning. Impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deductive reason is possible. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span> This is deductive: you hear from Kṛṣṇa, and this is fact. And if you want to make research, how that living entity never takes birth, then it will take time and at the same it may not be perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I finally understood why you were always talking to Svarūpa Dāmodara about inductive and deductive reasoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because it's just not possible to go the other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By inductive reason you cannot reach the truth perfectly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because it's beyond the material creation and you have to use the material senses and mind to understand. It's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, our point is deductive. What Kṛṣṇa says, that is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So first prove the existence of God and the existence of the spirit soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...and then, they'll just have to explain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then it's creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And that it's creation. They'll just have to accept they have desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aham evāsam evāgre.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata's</span> first instruction to Brahma. <span class="Italic">Aham evāsam agre. Agre</span> means in the beginning. So in the beginning Kṛṣṇa was there, then creation took place. Similarly in the beginning of this body, "I am spirit soul," was there. Then the body comes out. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is there, therefore the whole cosmic manifestation has come about. <span class="Italic">Aham evāsam agre.</span> And at the end of the creation, Kṛṣṇa is there. Similarly at the end of this body, I am there. Again I'll create another body. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's Kṛṣṇa's trick just to give us this facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is Kṛṣṇa's trick just to give us facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because I wanted it. Kṛṣṇa doesn't want it. But because you are rascals we wanted it. Kṛṣṇa (says,) "Alright, do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So therefore, in the beginning Kṛṣṇa gives you the big post, Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Now you're in charge of creating a whole universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you want lord it over, "Alright you become Brahma." He gives so much facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And then this Brahmā creates so many different desires, and then he goes through all the different bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Everyone becomes Brahmā first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. Or if you want to be a cat you can become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> How can they say this isn't science? This is so incredible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Desire is there. Desire is there. Just like in your country, the nudism going on. The desire is, "Ah, I shall remain free, naked." So Kṛṣṇa is giving you facility, "Alright, you stand here for thousands of years as tree, naked, nobody will criticize. You want to remain naked on the public street and you want to enjoy in that way, alright you become tree."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because desire is a function of consciousness, which is a symptom of the spirit soul, it's very powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because it's spiritual actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">. Abhilāṣ</span> means desire. <span class="Italic">Anya</span> means "except service of Kṛṣṇa." That is beginning of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> As soon as he desires something material for enjoyment he has to come to Me. <span class="Italic">Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati [Bg.<b class="calibre4"> </b></span>15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> The mind and the senses; with these things he is struggling for existence. Otherwise he is part and parcel of Krs..., <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhutaḥ jīva-loka sanātana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is eternal but because he is influenced by the mind, desires, and the senses, sense enjoyment, he is struggling. This is it, a struggle. So when he is too much fatigued, Kṛṣṇa comes and gives you good counsel. "You rascal give up these all desires. Surrender to Me, I give you protection." But he'll not do that. And if he agrees then <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> all material desires, zero. Then <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> begins. And if you have got a little pinch of material desires, then you have to accept different types of body. It will create, naturally. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is desiring under the influence of particular modes of nature, and he's getting body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> One has to be very careful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise even a devotee like Bhārata Mahārāja, he had to accept the body of a deer. A little careless. Then nature's law will act. Hm? If you do not become cautious and if you infect the smallpox disease, you have to suffer. Therefore a civilized man takes process, caution, "Oh there is smallpox disease, I shall not go there. Or if I go there, I must take vaccine." This is human civilization, caution. And if you are animal, you do not know. So human life means not animal life. Very reasonable, very cautious, educated, cultured, that is human life. Not animal life. Drink like animal, or eat like animal, have sex life like animal. Freedom, animal has got all freedom. So that freedom is not allowed to the human beings. That is civilization. The same example. The animal has got freedom and you'll see in Indian market, vegetable market, some cow comes and eats, takes so many vegetables and eats, but he's not going to the court. But if you take one small piece of chili without, then you'll go to the court. So therefore, law is meant for human beings, not for the animals. Those who want to be free, they are animals. So-called freedom means animalism. That is not humanism. Humanism means to follow the rules and regulations and the laws, and then he is human being. Because law is meant for the human being, not for the animals. And when you come out from your home, immediately the law is keep to the right. And if you violate, immediately you go to the law. But a dog, he doesn't care. If you say, "A dog does not obey this law," that is no excuse. You are human being. If you don't obey then you go to jail. So many animals are on the street naked, they're having sex life, naked. You do, immediately you'll be prosecuted. Why? Because you are a human being. You have to restrain. Even if you like. Just like the Hawaii University students, "What is the wrong to become a dog?" So if you think like that then you become a dog, nature is ready to give you a dog's body. That is (Sanskrit). He's thinking, "The dog's life is very nice. This liberation of sex life on the street." "Alright, you take dog's body." <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vā... Bhāvam...</span> ah, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Smaran bhāvam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. <span class="Italic">Tyajanty ante kalevaram.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caitya-guru:</span> <span class="Italic">Taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. "So you are thinking like dog, alright you take the body of a dog." And finished. Your human life is finished. And again wait for millions of years to come to the human form of life. Nature's law you cannot check. <span class="Italic">Daivī hi eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> The law is there. The same example, if you contaminate some disease, the law is you must suffer from that disease. So they are thinking "free." That is their gross ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very important then to accept some <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very important to accept some <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> to purify your desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, that is, that requires <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">. Tapasya</span> means to purify the desire. <span class="Italic">Tat paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore if you simply keep your desires to the service of Kṛṣṇa, you become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> (singing) <span class="Italic">Govinda hari, gopāla. Harer jaya jaya, prabhu dina dayala hari.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> (carries on singing on his way) <span class="Italic">Govinda jaya, gopāla jaya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This declaration of freedom is animal. Animal freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! Thank you. They are struggling for false freedom. This is not freedom. This is becoming entangled. And when we voluntarily give up all freedom, "This is all nonsense! Kṛṣṇa, I surrender unto you." <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> then he's really wise. When he fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caitya-guru:</span> Then he knows, <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise how he'll surrender. He must be convinced that Kṛṣṇa is everything, so let me surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Then he is wise. Otherwise he is an animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A really wise person could understand that there's no choice but to surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He must. He is already under the control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's always controlled at every moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But he's... He prefers to be controlled by the laws of nature instead of by Kṛṣṇa. That is his misfortune. He is controlled, but he thinks, "I am free." That is ignorance. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Just like I am the state citizen. I am not free. I must work according to the state laws. But he (thinks), "I shall... I don't care for government." That is my foolishness. You have to care. At home I can say to my wife, "I don't care for government, I don't care for the police." But when there is crime, when the police comes, then he says "Ohh." (pulls a sad face-laughter) He can be very much proud before his wife, "I don't care for anything." But when the police comes, "What can I do?" (Hindi) There is an example that the, what is called, <span class="Italic">mūrgī?</span> What you call? Toast? No. Host? No. What is called? <span class="Italic">Mūrgī, mūrgī?</span> Chicken? The male, male?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Rooster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Rooster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rooster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Cock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So the, when in the morning, it is let loose, then he says, "I don't care for any hahaa, cawcaw." Then in the evening, when they are pushed into the, that what is called? Nest? "Cawcawcawcaw. Whatever you like you can do, whatever you like you can do." (laughter) This is the example. You see? When he's under the arrest, "Now sir, whatever you like, you do with me. If you like you can excuse me." (laughter) And when he's out, "I don't care for anyone." <span class="Italic">Mūrgī</span> intelligence. Rooster intelligence. This is our proposal. "I don't care for anyone. I am God." <span class="Italic">Mūrgī</span> logic. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">,</span> if one is not a devotee, his only business is to remain on the mental platform and concoct things. And at the end he thinks that "I am God." Concoction. Therefore it is said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra, harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is not a devotee, he has no good qualification. He is simply on the, hovering on the mental platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The sixteenth chapter describes it very nicely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca, na vidur āsurāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> In which way we have direct out activities, in which way we shall have to stop our activities: they do not know. <span class="Italic">Āsurāḥ janā.</span> Because they don't take direction from God. They make their own way of speculation. So therefore, they are animals, or demons. Because they do not take direction during life, therefore at the end Kṛṣṇa comes, <span class="Italic">mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> All mental speculation, creation, is taken away at death. (to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa! It is said, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa nama koro vai ar sabe miche palaiba patha nāi yama āche piche:</span> take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, don't try to escape. Because behind you there is Yamaraja! (laughs) He will finish your all concoction. Hare Kṛṣṇa! (end)</div>
