<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> ...got the British out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hitler one side, fought with the Britishers, smashed them. This is one cause. Another cause: Hitler helped Subhas Chandra Bose to organize I.N.A. Two causes, the Britishers to go away. Otherwise, Gandhi's noncooperation movement was started in 1917, and we got our independence in 1947.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Thirty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty years he could not do anything. And Subhas Chandra Bose in 1940 or '42, he went out of India and organized this I.N.A with the help of Hitler, and the Britishers were obliged to leave India. What do you think? That is my estimation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Yes, I think so too. Yes, and he is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Hitler not only helped Subhas Chandra Bose to organize this I.N.A. organization, but by fighting with the Britishers, he smashed... The British lion was bandaged. There was a cartoon picture. I've seen in that way. The lion is lying down and bandaged, (makes some gestures) here and here and here, there, patched: British lion. (laughter) That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Subhas Chandra Bose he was in, I think he was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was my college friend. We studied in the same college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was one year senior to me. He appeared(?) from the year 1919, I appeared(?) in 1920.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Yes. And then he was in a plane crash? Or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a great history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Yes. I don't know if it is true. [break] ...taken <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> and just gone out somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, although you have got independence, India, oh, what is the profit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The independence is just about to come, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you start preaching there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real <span class="Italic">sva-raja</span> is to go back to home, back to Godhead. (end)</div>
