<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the result of the <span class="Italic">karma</span> is offered to God, then it is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Swamiji? Can I make an announcement? Swamiji has said there are fifty important pilgrimage cities in India, but as far as we're concerned here, it's whatever city His Divine Grace is residing in. So right now it's Boston. And he will stay here so long as it's the best place to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So you have some taste for it. You can help us to keep Boston this city of pilgrimage. We need engagements for Swamiji. The universities will be closing... Well, some of them are almost already closed. But if you have any access to a nice engagement, a church or a club where people attend, please approach us and help us to spread in this way. Also we have a love feast here in the temple every Sunday at noon, and this is very sumptuous <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> love feast with Indian delicacies that you'll certainly enjoy. So approach this way. We'll take collections at this time also. You can help us very solidly by putting in all that you can. Our next <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is scheduled for Wednesday-Monday, Wednesday, and Friday-but it won't be, because it will be held at MIT instead in the student mezzanine lounge in the third floor at eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wednesday there will be no meeting here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, there'll be no <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> That's the next engagement, May 8th. Also, does anyone have a car? Swamiji lives nine blocks away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got a car? Thank you.</div>
