<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It came to my mind today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is beginning of knowledge. Everyone is thinking that he is independent. But completely under the control of prakṛti.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate, sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">. </span>Then <span class="Italic">brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham amṛtasyāvyayasya ca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the entrance? Here? This side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> This will be, there. This will be the entrance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A small door?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No, no. This three big space, about seven feet, seven feet, seven feet. There's three openings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Scientists, do they accept this <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think many of those wise people do accept. But you have been harsh to all and none, all of them at par. But so many of them are really intelligent people who accept... Because we can't do so many things. Practically nothing we can do. Because we find out something here and there does not mean that we are perfect in knowledge. But the scientists nowadays are different than what the scientists were in those days when you were a student. And you think we are just like that. We are different today. He's a scientist. He will tell you. The scientists do see... Scientists do, does the <span class="Italic">darśana </span>of God in every part of the science, in every cell of living cell, every atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What was the report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Of the books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The report, speak to him, that science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The reporter? Scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Few scientists may be like that. That does not mean all scientists are like that. We are here. Half a dozen of us are scientists, aren't we here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Suppose you are a scientist, I am scientist, so if you do not believe in God, I believe in God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can I not believe in God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You say some of the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, somebody else does not believe in God. Don't put me there. (laughter) He does not believe in God. Suppose he does not believe in God. (laughter) It is impossible for me not to believe in God, how much I may try even in my dream. It is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am speaking not you but a scientist, so-called scientist. So what did he say? That "There is no need of God"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. He said, "We don't know where the elements came from that made the creation, but we know that we don't require God to explain it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the reply. All the so-called scientists, their only point is how to deny the existence of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But how can you say, "All the scientists," sir? I strongly oppose this statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Giriraj:</span> I have spoken to many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, all scientists</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Majority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Some of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I have spoken to many students coming out of the Indian schools, and they all say that "The universe was created by a chunk and it exploded," and they have no training that God is there behind everything that you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything is occuring by explosions. In our mind an explosion occurs, and we start believing in God. So that is not that, sir. I think they are misguided. How can anything happen without a supreme power?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are misguided, how they are scientists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But we have all learned in the same schools of science, he, I and the rest, also scientists, here. We have learned the same way the science. But it all depends upon how he grasps it, how he thinks about it, how he understands it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that we can understand, that he is grasping like a fool. Therefore we call them "fools, rascals." There was a newspaper interview with a so-called scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The great-grandfather of modern science, Einstein, did he not believe in God? He made darśana of God everywhere. Even in explosion of atom he saw it. Even in his theory of relativity, he finally said it was wrong. "All things are relative to God." That is what he said. And I don't think there is a greater scientist than Einstein in the modern times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are some scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If other fellows say any damn thing, that does not mean... Even though he may be a Nobel Prize winner, that does not mean that he is really a true scientist. He may be all right. He is looking through a long narrow tube in his own subject, a specialist. I have my definition about a specialist is a one who sees through long narrow tube and he got this much vision of the horizon. Such a man may be saying like this to you. I don't think we should deride that science... Scientists are trying to approach God through their own way, sir. That is what I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That doesn't matter if you call them "rascal" or no rascal, but that is their way. That's all. Our way is this; their way may be that. We must not... By many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. God says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can manufacture your own way? That is rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that is their <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can you say that? You may call them "rascal." Doesn't matter to them. But then that is their way, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Yes... That is obstinacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That... Obstinacy or no obstinacy, that is their way. That's all. Truth has to be understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot understand God in your own way. That is not possible. Everyone is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Those also come to Me," <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam. Avidhi-pūrvakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Avidhi </span>means rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You may call them rascal or rogue or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Avidhi, avidhi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they are going to the same place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are a medical man. If somebody is doing wrongly, you must say it is a rascaldom. Yes. You cannot accept, "Oh, you are all right. You are all right. You are doing in your own way." (laughter) He's another rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, that's right, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right? You are a medical man and you'll, you'll...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Still I say... You'll hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, I cannot hear this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, we don't understand the working of those people in Africa, those junglis. But they do some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are not a <span class="Italic">junglis;</span> you are a medical man, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Please listen to me. I beseech you to hear me for a minute. They do some things which we cannot explain, and we do by their own ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The scientists know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you do in your own way, that is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then we are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am representative to all the rascals of the world here. (laughs) That way, if you say so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything which is really scientific, you cannot do in your own way. Two plus two equal to four is applicable everywhere. You cannot say, "Two plus two equal to five. It is my own way." This is rascaldom. Scientific means "two plus two-four." It is accepted everywhere. You cannot say, "Two plus two equal to three. That is my own way."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So many phenomenas which are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is rascaldom. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are not able to explaining...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientific means there cannot be two opinions. The same, that is scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Aren't there multiple ways of approaching the same truth? One may be more straight. <span class="Italic">Bhakti </span>may be more straight, according to us, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. But we are... Truth is one. Truth is one. You cannot say that "I have got my own way of understanding truth." That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, then I honestly have a little difference, and that is that truth is one point and we want to approach it. You go staight, directly. Yours is the shortest cut. I may be a fool, or a what you call, <span class="Italic">mūḍha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how you can remain...? If you are fool, how you can become a scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But our science is taught to us, that's all. You may say anything about it, but that is what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you say, "My scientific way is foolish way..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes. Mine is foolish way, according to you. But according to you... Just be very wise. What is truth only God knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is going on. That is your science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is truth, God knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is... A dog is also thinking that he is very intelligent. That is going on all over the world. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā. </span>That is rascaldom. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā. </span>"Oh, I am all right. I am going on my own way." That is rascaldom. That we say, rascaldom. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā. </span>This is rascal... <i class="calibre3">Vimūḍhātmā</i> means rascaldom. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">. </span>That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the real scientists don't say this, that they are <span class="Italic">karta. </span>That is the difference in the modern scientists and the little, hundred years back scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here the scientists says, "There is no need of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That one man told you, and you have been, I mean, deriding all the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, mostly they are speaking that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are very harsh to the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have created havoc, godlessness, atheism, all over the world. That is our protest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And we are taking the benefit of that science by flying by the plane, by going by train...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has become a difficult task.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...by putting on these clothes, and so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the students, they say... What do they say? The students?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That in the beginning there was a chunk, and it exploded, and there's no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they are spoiling the career. Whole life is spoiled. They are being taught in this way. <span class="Italic">Andha yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. </span>This is going on, schools, colleges: "Don't believe in God." That has become a fashion, advancement. Yes. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But all are not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Not all, but some. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not some, ninety percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Some of the fools like him may be thinking like that. I have been right from the... I was born in science and I never thought that there was no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Do you call me an exception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. I know. I know you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, but I am one of the scientists. He is one of the scientists. He has put on these clothes and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are supporting the rascal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but, I don't support a rascal. My explanations are... I strongly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you say that "He is trying to understand in his own way."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, that's right. Now, this point, you go straight. I go this way if I am a mūḍha, but I go there. That's all right. I'm a <span class="Italic">mūḍha. </span>You may call me a fool. I don't mind it. But that is my way, and I am adamant about it. You may call me <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham... [Bg. </span>3.27]. But he is not calling himself a <span class="Italic">karta.</span> He goes his own way. That's all. I am sorry to say these words to you, but this is what they think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) Call them if you like. Those were the rascals before. Some of them are rascals before. Even then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is not... I am not trying, but Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa says, "<span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>" Kṛṣṇa says, "<span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I was a rascal until I met Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are now not a rascal. I have been watching you. Thing is this, that there are multiple ways of God. We don't know the greatness of God. We just... I feel aghast in thinking about greatness of God, simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no multiple ways. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There may be any number of ways, but I feel that there is what greatness of God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... We protest. There is no many number. There is only one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That depends on his own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But you must be benevolent to these people, at least to an extent, to the scientists, that all scientists are wrong, are they? All scientists are not gadhas. Some of them are good (Hindi) and some of them evolve into man even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we say... If somebody says that "I have got my own way to understand," he is not scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Their own way, a section of humanity's way. Not one man's. Science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There cannot be many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, our<span class="Italic"> sad-darśana. </span>The <span class="Italic">Vaiśeṣika śāstra</span> is nothing but the modern science. The Vaiśeṣikas also wanted, were going in search of God by their own way, were they not? The <span class="Italic">Vaiśeṣika śāstra</span> is nothing but the physics and chemistry and mathematics, in true sense. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Sad-darśana.</span> Vaiśeṣika is one of the recognized darśanas of our ancient, glorious past. I think I am not wrong, sir, in that way. You will pardon me if I say, and I mean, press my point further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you will say it is in your own way, even if it is wrong...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. These are Vaiśeṣikas. They are Vaisesikas. <span class="Italic">Sudras</span> you may call them, but <span class="Italic">Vaiśeṣika-śāstra </span>was also found out by ancient civilized Indians in search of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the physics, chemistry, biology, science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāvaṇa was the greatest civilized man, but he is considered as rākṣasa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But we are not Rāvaṇas, are we? We are Vaiśeṣikas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are scientists, Vaiśeṣika scientists. We may not be <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> scientists, but Vaiśeṣika scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhakta is the only scientist. All others rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That you may say, but, well... We are also <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we don't say. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But who? Those who are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals. All these rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those who are not in search of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who has not understood Kṛṣṇa, they are all <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā. </span>He may be <span class="Italic">Vaiśeṣika, kanaḍa, paramānuvada, māyāvāda.</span> There are so... I know these.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They different, different philosophies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vaiśeṣika is one of the six sciences, just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">māyāvāda</span> is also one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Māyāvāda does not belong to one of the six sciences, do they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kanaḍa, Gautama, Astavakra, then <span class="Italic">nāstika </span>Kapila. There are so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Patañjali.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Patañjali <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is also... He said,<span class="Italic"> iśvaraḥ pari danaiva.</span> (?) Doesn't he say in the <span class="Italic">rāja-yoga sutra</span> that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is suggesting, but he has no clear idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He definitely has said in thirty-fourth <span class="Italic">sutra, īśvaraḥ pari danaiva: </span>"If you can't vacate your mind, put God inside."<span class="Italic"> iśvaraḥ pari danaiva.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This boy wants to go in gurukula school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapataka:</span> In your prayer we say, <span class="Italic">pāścātya-deśa-tāriṇe. </span>But now don't you think we could say "<span class="Italic">viśva</span>"? (Prabhupāda chuckles) I think that there's no place... You've not only covered Western world but practically whole world.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapataka:</span> There was a group of reporters who went to see the district magistrate, and they were asking him, taking interview about so many different things. So finally they kept asking about ISKCON because of our Māyāpura center. So he said, "Well, I can't say anything about that. I can't say..." Finally one reporter asked another very direct question about their staying here, this, that. And he said, "I have order from Indira Gandhi that the officers, that <span class="Italic">maṭha gaṁrami na.</span>(?) No one, officer, should worry about ISKCON. You just do your own thing. So I can say nothing about them. I have got no authority to say anything about them. We've got this order from Indira Gandhi." Then the reporter said, "Oh, we can print that?" He said, "Please don't print that. Otherwise I will lose my job." So when the local Congress people heard that, they were very happy, our friends. So I think your visit did a great benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapataka:</span> I brought the letter that the district magistrate gave, recommending...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I have to call him at nine o'clock and ask him to come earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You have already appointed time, you said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No, he suggested eleven, and I said I would ask you and ring him back at nine.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Immediately ask them to dispatch to Māyāpura all books for demonstration. That is the main item, and they have not sent in Māyāpura? Caitanya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, other than the <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā,</span> the later volumes only came within about a few days ago.</div>
