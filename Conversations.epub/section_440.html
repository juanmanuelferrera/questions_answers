<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as... Just like dog he does not know that he is controlled by the master, "Tch tch tch tch," chain. He does not know. He is thinking, "I am now free. Rau! Rau! Rau! Rau! Rau!" This is the position, no difference between the dog and so-called big, big men. If the dog thinks that he is free and he can jump over anywhere freely, is it possible? No. Fully controlled under the master. He has accepted this control.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially in the western countries, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the people do not like to think that they are controlled or that they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. He is controlled in every step, and he is thinking... Therefore rascals. In spite of this big, big house, nice road and good car, they are rascals. But he thinks falsely. He thinks that he is independent; He will not die. Then why does he think like that, like a foolish man? As soon as <span class="Italic">māyā</span> kicks on his face, he will die. That's all. Immediately. "I have got some business, sir." "No, no, you must die immediately." And still, he thinks that he is not controlled. What is this nonsense? We shall go that side? That is knowledge, that "In spite of my all so-called advancement of civilization, I am controlled." That is knowledge. That is the beginning of knowledge. Then he should think how to get out of it. That is intelligence. And if, like cats and dogs, he thinks that "I am not controlled," then he is no better than cats and dogs. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> By <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> by nature, he is pulled by the ears, "Come here!" "Yes, sir." "Come there!" "Yes, sir." And he is thinking, not controlled. As soon as he eats little more than he requires, "You must starve three days!" And he is not controlled. Just see. How much foolishness. And they are getting Nobel Prize. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> No one has ever gotten a Nobel Prize for saying, "Yes, we are all controlled."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the man who is awarding him Nobel Prize, he is also a rascal, (laughs) and he is also rascal. The society of rascals, that's all. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, therefore, "This is a society of cheaters and cheated." That's all. Somebody is cheater, and somebody is cheated. And they have made a civilization of cheaters and cheated. That's all. They have got good sense. They have... Just try to utilize it. Just like last night that gentleman, "In my opinion..." He never thinks that what he is, what is the value of his opinion. But he thinks, "In my opinion..." And what is this nonsense? What is your opinion? Then he admits "No, no, I have no objection." That is progress, that he admitted his fault. What is the value of your opinion? I said, "We have no opinion. We take the opinion of Kṛṣṇa, that's all." We have no opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> You caught him in the end, though, when you said, "If Kṛṣṇa is man, then this is no value." And then he said, "How do you know Kṛṣṇa really spoke this? How do you know this is really Kṛṣṇa?" So actually, he just did not accept Kṛṣṇa from the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He thinks that "Kṛṣṇa is a bigger philosopher, that's all. And I am also philosopher. So He has got His opinion, I have got my opinion. That's all." They think that. That is described, <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ: [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">]</span> "These rascals thinks Me as one of him, one like him." <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ.</span> Therefore Dr. Radhakrishnan and other rascals like him, they think, "Why Kṛṣṇa shall say, 'Surrender unto Me?' This is sophistry." What is the meaning of sophistry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Sophist is half-wise and half-foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He thinks that "I am as good philosopher as Kṛṣṇa. Why shall I surrender to Kṛṣṇa? I have got my own opinion." He thinks like that. And that rascal is writing commentary on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And it is selling also. Therefore we presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> not a rascal ism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> People buy his book because he is the former president of India. They think he's authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. He does not know that he is a fool number one, fully under the con... Now his position. I saw him in Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Paralyzed, paralyzed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, you cannot recognize. And he gives his opinion. Just see. Nobody thinks that "If I am not controlled, I do not wish to die, why there is death? I do not wish to become old. Why there is old age?" A common sense. "I do not wish to be diseased. Why there is disease? And still, I am thinking that I am not controlled." That means no brain even, common sense. <span class="Italic">Piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya.</span> Just like ghostly haunted, madman. He stands on the st..., "I am the king." He stands on the street. It is like that. He does not know, "At any moment I will be knocked by any car and I shall die." But he thinks like, "I am the king." Madman. They are all madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I remember when I was living downtown eastside New York, there was one drunkard who was standing on the street directing traffic, trying to stop the cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They do that. We have seen that. He thinks, "I am the controller. He must do..." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone who has read your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, after having read so many <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās,</span> everyone has understood that "At last <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is very clear and simple to me. I have not understood before."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because all these so-called <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> commentaries written by rascals, that's all. They are all rascals. They cannot understand what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The MacMillan Company's trade manager has admitted that while others <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is selling less, this is increasing. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So I prepared one argument this morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There's a theory of the psychologists that-in some ways it's similar to our idea-that people are conditioned, that according to their environment, according to their upbringing, according to their parentage and so on, they have a kind of way of acting and thinking. So their argument is that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is just another kind of conditioning, that you leave one kind of conditioning, a material conditioning, but then you also enter into another kind of conditioning when you live in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is conditioning, certainly. The position is that you must be under certain condition. That is your position. So if you become conditioned by God, that is your perfection. And if you become conditioned by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that is your trouble. You must be conditioned. That is your position. You cannot be independent. And therefore, if you become naturally conditioned, then that is your happy life. Just as child, he must be conditioned. But when he is conditioned by his parents, that is his perfection of life. Your position is that you must be conditioned. Why you are thinking to be independent? That is your rascaldom. You should always know that "I must be conditioned. That is my life." <span class="Italic">Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Condition. Still conditioned, but <span class="Italic">daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ,</span> under the spiritual nature. That is <span class="Italic">Mahātmā. Mahātmā</span> is not independent. He is also conditioned. So first of all, we must understand that our natural position is to be conditioned. Now, why, where I shall be conditioned? Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You condition here. "You become conditioned by Me. Then you will be happy." Those who are thinking that "We shall not be conditioned," they are still in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You cannot be without condition.</div>
<div class="Verse">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām<br class="calibre2"/>eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān<br class="calibre2"/> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So that one God is supplying the necessities of life. That is His condition. Suppose you are giving me all necessities of life. Then it is, the best part of my valor is to live under your control. That's all. I cannot be independent. It is not possible. That is the wrong philosophy, that these rascals are thinking of complete independence. That means they are becoming more and more conditioned by this material external energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Their program is that if a child's problems come from the wrong kind of conditioning, then he should be given the opportunity in childhood of a good family, good education, and so on, and that way there won't be bad reaction later on in life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he should be given chance for better conditioning. Conditioning must go on. It cannot be said that "Let the child be given freedom." No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yeah, that's what they say. They say it's freedom when there is a lack of bad conditioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Bad condition is good conditioning. Where is freedom? From bad conditioning you are suggesting good conditioning. That is not freedom. Just like you are in the prison house, you are badly conditioned, but the so-called freedom-you are still conditioned under the laws of the state. You are not free. But from bad conditioning to good conditioning. And if you obey the state laws, then you are good citizen. But you are conditioned. How you think of freedom? That is your foolishness. Just like a servant. He is in some mercantile firm. He is trying to seek out some government service. But he cannot be free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So in other words, they would say your idea is to give them a better conditioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, not better conditioning. You must know what is the best condition and take that condition. The best condition is to be under the control of Kṛṣṇa. That is your best first-class way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> You said that in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> when it speaks of being desireless, it means that actually one is desiring for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that <span class="Italic">na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye:</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4] "I don't want this." "Don't want, don't want, don't want" does not mean he becomes negative. "I want Kṛṣṇa. So many things, 'Don't want,' but actually I want Kṛṣṇa. And that is my life." And not that "Don't want, don't want, don't want, then become zero." Not that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No, they also say we know what we want. We want food for everyone, we want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he does not know. Therefore he is changing from this place to that place. He does not know. If he had known, then he would have surrendered immediately to Kṛṣṇa. That is the defect. He does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But the idea is "We can accomplish the same good results even without Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he does not know. He is a fool. He does not know what is a good result. He will change again. He is a rascal. He is putting himself in this condition; again he'll desire another condition. That is the change of body. That is his wanting. Sometimes he's taking the body of a dog, sometimes he is taking the body of a demigod. <span class="Italic">Bhramatam upary adhaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[1.5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Down, just like, what is that? Merry-go-round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Ferris wheel, ferris wheel goes up and down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes "I am so up," and again come down. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān.</span> Therefore, in this way, going round, one who is very, very fortunate, he, <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">,</span> he comes to the devotional life by the mercy of guru and Kṛṣṇa. This is the beginning of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction. They are under the myth, under the spell of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, they say "You are distributing food, and we are also distributing food. You are opening schools, and we are also opening schools."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But we are opening school for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore the rascals, they cannot understand what is <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and what is <span class="Italic">karma. Bhakti</span> looks like <span class="Italic">karma,</span> but it's not <span class="Italic">karma.</span> It is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> They cannot understand what is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti</span> means the same <span class="Italic">karma,</span> but for Kṛṣṇa's sake. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Just like the same fight, battlefield, but because it was done for Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna is accepted, <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si priyo 'si me:</span> [Bg. 4.3] "You are My devotee. You are My very dear." But what did he do? His business was to fight. He fought, that's all. But fought for Kṛṣṇa. That is the secret. He did not change his fighting capacity as a warrior. But he changed his mentality. His mentality was that "Why shall I kill my kinsmen?" But Kṛṣṇa wanted, "Oh, that's all right." So therefore service is for Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Not for his sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Karmī</span> means sense gratification, and <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> means Kṛṣṇa's sense gratification. That is the difference. Sense gratification is there. When you do it for your personal sense grati..., it is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And you do it for Kṛṣṇa's sense gratification, it is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So therefore they look similar, but the quality is different. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">. Dhare prema nāma.</span> The <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they acted like prostitutes, but the center was Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, <span class="Italic">ramyā kacid upāsanā vrajavadhu-vargena ya kalpita</span> (?): "Oh there is no more better mode of worship than it was conceived by the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span>" What is their conception? Prostitution, that's all. Simple prostitute. Kṛṣṇa was a beautiful boy and they were attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa. They wanted Him as their husband, lover, to dance with them. That is the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> And these rascals are taking that "This is very good. Kṛṣṇa also did like this. So let us do; gather some girls and dance, and we become Kṛṣṇa." This is Māyāvāda, Therefore Vyāsadeva has devoted nine cantos just to understand Kṛṣṇa. Then try to understand what is the <span class="Italic">gopīs'</span> behavior with Kṛṣṇa. But these rascals jump over it. <span class="Italic">Sahajiyās.</span> Jump over Kṛṣṇa's dealing with the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> And that is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Because rascals, they shall remain rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> If the Māyāvādī accepts the principle that <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is good, but at the end he throws it away, will he have a change of heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Māyāvāda. That is Māyāvāda. They have no conception of the eternity of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Will the change in heart come about for such persons because they're somehow associated with Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Kaṁsa associated with Kṛṣṇa always, their position is like that. That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti</span> is <span class="Italic">ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">,</span> favorable, not to reject Kṛṣṇa or kill Kṛṣṇa, and think of Kṛṣṇa, "How to kill Him? How to kill Him? How to kill Him?" That is also Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but that is not favorable. Therefore it is not <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> But they get the salvation because they have some way or other thought of Kṛṣṇa. Impersonal salvation. They are not allowed to enter into the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In the beginning of devotional service, the concentration is on the service more than on Kṛṣṇa the person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But then gradually, as we serve and serve and concentrate on the service, then there's realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, realization comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Of who we're serving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The disciple serves Kṛṣṇa under the direction of spiritual master. <span class="Italic">Vidhi-mārga,</span> regulative principles. <span class="Italic">Vidhi-mārga, rāga-mārga.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...gunarna jata nat krta mukha santi</span> (?). So, I think it is mud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Here it's getting more and more moist, dew. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...friend, but what is my business? My business is to serve the senses, that's all. <span class="Italic">Kāmādīnām, kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mātsarya, mada,</span> the six kinds of sense gratification I am doing. This is actual... Just like this man, he is thinking he is very big man, but he's servant of his dog. Is it not? But he is thinking that he is very big man. He does not think that "What is my business? To serve this dog in the morning." He has no sense. Because he has no prescribed duty to serve Kṛṣṇa... He must serve, and therefore he must serve dog. That is his position. But still, he's thinking, "Why these foolish people are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? I am serving the dog. I am very big man." He has become very big man by serving the dog, and we are trying to serve Kṛṣṇa. We...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> ...even though it is covered by smoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That even though one's activities in the material world are covered by faults, still one should perform his activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In India there is a Hindi proverb, <span class="Italic">bekase begar achar</span> (?)... (end)</div>
