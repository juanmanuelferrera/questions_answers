<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> We took a few pictures that you could see. We took some pictures for you to look at of the restaurant. It's still being built, so there's not actually that much to see. This street that it's on is very heavily traveled all day. This is taken at about five o'clock in the morning, so there's no one there. It's still under construction, you can see all the cinderblocks inside. But it's all glass building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is being rented or purchased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> That's still being worked out. I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> I think we're going to purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> I think Ambarīṣa is purchasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The back building? That is a different building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> No, yeah. This is condominiums, houses, for people living above, so the restaurant is just that one floor. That's what we would be purchasing, not the whole building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The kitchen is inside the big building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> But it's very choice space. It's just two blocks from what's called the Ritz Hotel, which is most famous hotel in the country, they have in every large city. These pictures, that glassed-in area, that would all be just the serving area. Then the kitchen is behind the wall. There would be a large kitchen facility, where all the devotees would be cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kitchen is within the building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti and Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one-story building also included?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, there's a kitchen and dish-washing room and office, storage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> All inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did you explain that it was being built for someone who was going to start a restaurant, but they didn't?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> Yes. They ran out of money, these people, and there were so many restrictions at this location because of these buildings here. People live there, and they didn't want anyone in there who was going to cook meat. And they didn't want anyone who was going to serve intoxication. So practically we're the only people that don't serve meat and intoxication. So actually they're very glad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The man who owns it says he gets fifty phone calls every day from people who want that space. It's such a good space that fifty people a day call.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> People are very interested, the location is excellent. It's on one of the most important streets in all of Boston.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Once we get open we'll be able to serve a thousand people a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And what you are charging?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> We're charging anywhere between three and eight dollars. Eight dollars for a very big, many preparations and different nectars and very sumptuous feast for eight dollars. And then if you just want a sandwich or something a little smaller you can pay just three dollars. We think we'll be making about half a million dollars a year, which will all go to you, Prabhupāda. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So we couldn't call the restaurant the "Hare Kṛṣṇa Restaurant" because there were some restrictions in the block, so we were thinking we'd call it "Saṅkīrtana." That's okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. They are Hare Kṛṣṇa phobia; they are afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti and Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have suggested "Saṅkīrtana"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, they think that is nice. They do not know what that means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like our Haridāsa. You know Haridāsa? Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, uh-huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He, Moscow, he was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa on the street, and when people asked "What is this?" "This is cinema song."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Sometimes as devotees we have to be a little bit crooked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) We shall do everything as the material person does, <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> do, but we have to do everything for Kṛṣṇa, not person. Then it is all right. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> There's one thing, our best hours, some of the best business in the restaurant, would be very late at night, like between nine to eleven o'clock at night. So is that all right as long as we can arrange...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> ...everyone's following the program? People are up 'til midnight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Still they will come to the morning program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there will be picture of Caitanya Mahāprabhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> A nice altar, small altar, <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The temple is only one block away. We were wondering, should we offer the food to the Deities in the temple or should we offer it in the restaurant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better in the restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Better in the restaurant. Yes, that is a little easier also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must know that they're eating <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> There was one other thing. Mānasvī, he is outside of New York. And I don't know very much what his position is. I talked to him once, he wanted to see you in New York. I don't know if you know that. Because he says that all these things are not true. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a thief. He has taken about twenty-five thousand dollars. He's a thief from the very beginning. What he is doing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> He's working two jobs. They won't allow him in the temple. I think you sent one letter or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he should not be admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Also in Boston there's a lady who may be donating a million-dollar farm to the Boston Temple. This is just a project that's a little bit..., that's just started, and she wants to donate her farm. So that is also going on, and also the temple is purchasing the building next door. I gave them some money for a down payment on it so they could buy the building next door to use it to house the people that are living in the restaurant and also for the Bhaktivedanta Institute, because I think the Bhaktivedanta Institute is going to be in Boston. Mādhava is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Boston is nice place for the Institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> Best place for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's the educational center of America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Academic center of the United States. So now we are fixing up the temple very nicely. We've spent about fifty thousand dollars putting in all new tile floor and a beautiful new onyx altar. Very, very gorgeous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is framework or solid building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The building? It's stone, brownstone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then it's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Very sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> It's in a very nice area in Boston. Commonwealth Avenue was the most aristocratic street in Boston. The temple is right there, just one block from downtown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Near Commonwealth Pier?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> Near Boston Commons. Boston Commons? The big park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not park, there is a pier, pier (pronounces "pire") what do you call?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Oh, pier, pier. Oh, yes, it is near there, Prabhupāda, that's where you landed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, it is not far. We're having Ratha-yātrā in Boston for the first time this year, and we're going to take the Ratha carts down to Commonwealth Pier in honor of your arrival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) There is one A.P. store?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> A P?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A-P, A-P store.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Market? Yes, it's still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I saw first. (laughter) I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> So there are many nice projects going on in Boston. We are hoping that maybe sometime you can come. That would be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. From New York it is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, it is very close to New York, half-hour airplane ride.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were talking about different names for the restaurant yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja did not care for "Saṅkīrtana Restaurant." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I thought that there might be a name of Kṛṣṇa, like they were using "Govinda," but that's obviously a name for Kṛṣṇa. Because people don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> We wanted to have a name that was Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, just, exclusively Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. So we thought "Saṅkīrtana." No other movement, we're the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement. So we thought that name would show that it was exclusively Hare Kṛṣṇa, whereas many other Indians they have named their store "Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Store," stuff like this. So we thought...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Something perhaps more exotic. I was just thinking as a restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> We wanted something that was exclusively...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have started "Govinda's"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, that is in Hawaii. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Govinda's name is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> Yes, I always liked. Now Laguna Beach they are also calling it "Govinda's."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so why not continue this "Govinda's"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, we could, okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> It's very good publicity. If many are started, they are all "Govinda's," then everyone will recognize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Okay, there is no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣam.</span> So that's all right, "Govinda's."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> OK. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> Hari-śauri looks like he can give a very good massage. He looks like he can give a very good massage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mmm. Hari-śauri's one defect is he cannot cook. (laughter) Otherwise he is duplicate. Except cooking. He knows very good cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He can eat though. He can eat <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti:</span> So I can travel and cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cooking and.... A young man must eat. Why one should be like me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutikīrti and Ambarīṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] (tape continues after guest's entrance)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> ...the very best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> I'm very, very pleased. I (indistinct) of the bus (indistinct) with Satsvarūpa Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So just work cooperatively for the benefit of human society. We were just discussing our so many things. (to Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:) You can explain what I was talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How the present civilization is.... Just like here in Detroit, producing so many cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi to Indian girl)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So how long can this civilization go on, simply producing automobiles, like this? So the situation is that the people are always in a state of poverty. Just like the black people here in Detroit. Even they are making sufficient money, still they are always in a state of poverty because they don't know how to live. Prabhupāda related one story that the capitalist and the worker, both of them, they went to the goddess of fortune appealing for a benediction. So the capitalist asked, "Give me such money that I will be able to work one day and it will last me for six months." And then the worker, he went and he said, "Give me one thousand dollars I have every day to spend."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he said that "Give me the same money as the capitalist will spend in six months. I shall spend every day. I shall get that money every day and I shall spend it." So this worker class, there is no culture. You may pay them heavy amount of money, but they will spend it and remain a poor man. Because he has no culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> This is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see this black men. They earn sufficient money, but see their home. See their home. You America, you have given them equal rights, they are getting money, but they have no culture. Therefore you may pay them as much as you like, but still poverty-stricken. In Africa also I have seen that they have got their own kingdom, independence, but if we go to the African slums, they are poverty-stricken, wretched. So this civilization will not endure. If there is no culture, simply by money you cannot maintain a standard of civilization. That is not possible. Now the American leaders they are thinking, "Let us have money, then everything..." Of course, by money you are covering all the defects of the social culture. But this will not endure. Day will come and everything will be exposed. Therefore culture required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda was explaining how in India even the poorest people, they live, husband, wife, family, like this, in very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...simple quarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Happily they live. As soon as there is no quarrel between the husband and wife, the home will be happy. And as soon as there is misunderstanding between husband, wife, it will be hell. So the principle is the husband honestly tries to earn livelihood, and at home the wife should be so intelligent that whatever money the husband has earned, she'll manage. She'll not demand, "Bring money, bring money, bring money. Otherwise it cannot be..." Then the home will be happy. So where is that training?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> Well, there is no training here, there is no culture, as you pointed out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say culture, not training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> As a matter of fact, even among the educated classes in the United States, there is no culture. There are no cultural roots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no culture. There is no culture. There is no standard social life. Simply hodgepodge. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the only hope to bring everything in proper order. Everything is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So America is the leading nation of the world. If you work on the principle of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and train up your people, it will be ideal state and example for the whole world. At least a certain section of the American population should be ideal. That will also do. Not that..., we cannot expect cent percent will take Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not needed. But if there is one section of the people ideal, that will be followed. We want to create that section, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> May I pose a question, Your Grace? It's less than two weeks that I'm asking you for the second time to instruct me. You gave me some very general instructions in my last audience, and I'm very grateful. Many things have transpired since then. I'm now here in Detroit; we'll be going on to Toronto very shortly. From Toronto to Chicago, and then I'm not sure what the agenda is. I'm tremendously pleased because it's giving me an opportunity to work in the area that you said I should be working in. In addition to which I have ample time to study. And I have the assistance of Satsvarūpa with my studies. Now I have a question. I would like to keep a log of my daily activities and start preparing an outline of a book. Now the book very basically won't.... I won't be starting on the book for at least a year, but I would like to start keeping a log.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can keep record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> Yes. Now the reason I would like to keep a log and prepare an outline and start a book, say a year from now, it would show a transition from Roman priesthood to Hare Kṛṣṇa devotee. I think this would open up the door to all of the colleges and universities across the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good idea, yes. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> The nature is if we get better engagement, we give up inferior engagement. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.</span> So this will be an example. You are a Roman priest. You are educated, learned scholar also. So when you come to this movement, you do not come here by sentiment or by whims. You consider, then you have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> This is what I wanted to say, that I'm not here because of sentiment. I'm here for very, very sound reasons, and I want to explain the reasons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we are presenting these books, that we are not a so-called sect of whimsical faith. It is based on science and authorities. Recently we have got report that our books have been taken in Hamburg University. You know Hamburg University?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As their textbook for Sanskrit class. They found it so wonderful. Because for Sanskrit scholar it is good opportunity to learn Sanskrit, because each word we have given in English and German synonyms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> I want very much to learn basic Sanskrit, but I have so much to learn right now that ah,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not necessary, but those who are interested in studying Sanskrit literature, for them it is very good help. And at the same time they get sublime knowledge. They study Sanskrit and get knowledge. So you have kindly come to join us. You study our philosophy very minutely and then try to do something for the suffering humanity.</div>
<div class="Verse">nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau<br class="calibre2"/>lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau<br class="calibre2"/>rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena mattālikau<br class="calibre2"/>vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The saintly persons, at least in Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement, they are not meant for idle life. They are always busy for the welfare of the whole human society. This is the sign of saintly person. They are misguided and they are suffering, and it is the duty of the saintly person to give them instruction, education, how they can become really happy and make their life successful. This is saintly person. A saintly person doesn't mean to live at other's expenditure and do all nonsense things. This is not saintly person. Hm. (Hindi) [break] You asked me some question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> I wanted to know whether it would be all right to keep the log and to write at the..., work out the outline for the book. You told me to go ahead. So I will do that. Basically, this is what I wanted to do. I would like to continue with the group. I would like to travel with the group and keep an accurate log and start an outline and see possibly within a year's time I will have sufficient material to start the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, huh? You like this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) These boys who are working for this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do you like our men, the devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> Oh, I'm very, very impressed. This impressed me to begin with, their enthusiasm, their joy, and their complete surrender. This is what...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the secret of success. If one has got unflinching faith in his spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, then he's successful. Two things. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpā-pāya bhakti-latā-bīja.</span> So if the guru is false, then how they can keep their faith? That will be broken. Our process is very simple. There is no difficulty. You have seen our Los Angeles temple? When we purchased, it was a church, perhaps you know. Nobody was coming, so that they were obliged to sell. They started this Sunday class, this, that, so many things. In Melbourne also we have seen a big.... What was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It used to be what they call a Christian Brothers school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we wanted to purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, that nunnery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nunnery. So they wanted to maintain themselves by becoming washermen. Still, they could not maintain. They eventually became washerwoman to maintain. Huge establishment. So I wanted, negotiation was there. They persisted that the church should not be broken. No? To be broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, there were different sections. They had a school there and,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we thought that we shall use it as temple. That they disagreed. "No, you cannot keep it, you have to break it, then we can sell to you." Then why shall I break it? We shall pay for it and break it? No. Then the negotiation failed. But a huge land, and we are prepared to purchase. In England, in London, I was..., one, two churches I was negotiating, and one church, that man, he said, "I'll burn into ashes. I'll not sell it to Bhaktivedanta." (laughs) Recently we wanted to purchase in St. James Park one nice house. So they did not give us. They..., we offered better price; still they did not give us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Stansky:</span> Your Grace, the thing that impressed me the very most at the temple in Los Angeles.... Now you must bear in mind that I am very, very steeped in Catholicism, I'm very steeped in the New Testament. So when I observed what was happening at the temple in Los Angeles, I was seeing the Book of Acts coming to life. Something that died three hundred years ago in the Roman church. In 300 A.D. it died. Since then there's been no such example. And I was just amazed wandering around because there I saw the exact, the Book of Acts. And I was impressed.</div>
