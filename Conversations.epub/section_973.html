<div class="Purp-para">(Prabhupāda is very hoarse)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> How do you feel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have old man's disease, cough and cold, so coughing. But still, work is going on, and I shall complete eighty years this month. September, eighty-one. So now, due to age, it is becoming little difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa.... So how are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Quite good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. That is our life and soul. <span class="Italic">Gṛhe vā vanete thāke, 'hā gaurāṅga' bole ḍāke.</span> Wherever you live, it doesn't matter, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. That is our only support. So bring food here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We should have the lunch here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> All the devotees are looking really good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> The devotees are looking great. Strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span> By the result, one has to study. Yesterday, one devotee's father and mother came, Hari-śauri. She and his father were very pleased to see him healthy, bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> They hadn't seen him for six years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six years, yes. So we are inviting everyone, "Come here. Such a nice house given by George (laughs). You live here comfortably, eat nicely, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." We don't want any factory work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Simply <span class="Italic">kartal</span> and <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span> Still, people do not come. They'll prefer to go the factory, whole day work in the hell. (laughs) They prefer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I suppose some day the whole of the world will just be chanting in the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible, but if some of the leading men, they take it seriously, then others will follow. Just like in our book, your signature is there, "Oh, George Harrison. Yes." They take it without any consideration. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tad tad evetaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the leading man does something, then his followers also do. This is the way. So if some of the leading men of the world, they take this movement seriously, then people will be happy. There's no doubt about it. You have come alone, without any associate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Just on my own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It took me a while to find it. They're always building new roads everywhere and change the whole countryside. So I got a little lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You came here twice, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes, I've been here three times. Where will you be in India when you go back to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Most probably in Bombay. You have been in my Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I was going to go to Bombay. Yes, Bombay and Vṛndāvana when they were just building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Vṛndāvana, if you come there, stay for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes, well, ah, this December...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got very nice houses, both in Bombay and Vṛndāvana. And Māyāpur also. Wherever you like. You will not be very uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I was going to go to Bombay for a wedding. Some friends are getting married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> December the fifth, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice season in Bombay. Best time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> You know, I think you met Laksmi Shankar, lady singer? Her daughter, who is also a singer, Viji, Viji Śrī Shankar, and she's marrying a South Indian violin player, L. Shankar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's also Shankar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Well, he's called L. Shankar. You know that South India they have a funny way around them, they have like a surname. He's just called L. Shankar. His brother is called L. Subhramanyam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> George says he wants to spend some time in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I was only there for about thirty-six hours last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got now very good centers. Another gentleman, he's offering us a very good place at Mahābaleśvara. That's one of the famous India stations. A very nice climate. So you can come and stay there. We have got now many good centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I'll come and see if you're in Bombay, because I'll be near where the temple is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bombay is just like garden. As good as your place here. No. Not so big. It is seventeen acres, and Bombay is five. Just go on. (<span class="Italic">prasādam</span> being served) Give him whatever you have got to give. But don't give much. When he wants something more.... Waste not, want not. Give more, that preparation, you should give more. (laughter) That is called (indistinct). You can bring it, <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I'll just wash my hands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can wash here. The sink is there. Here is also water. You can put the bowls outside, here, so that there will be sufficient place. Our Indian system is like this. That's all right. Sit down, you also sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I see you've done new books. You've been so busy, there's so many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are already fifty-four, and another at least thirty books I have to finish before my death. (laughs) That I am.... Give him a <span class="Italic">puri.</span> Where is Ravi Shankar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> He's in.... I think he's in New York. He'll be here the first of August, and then I think he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got his house there? In New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No, just a house in Benares. Benares. He doesn't have anything. He just stays in hotels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I thought in Washington somebody told me that George Washing..., George Harrison has got his house here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes, he had a little house here, but he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have got your house in Washington?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Now we can begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Okay, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nimbu-pāni?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. You give him two more <span class="Italic">samosas,</span> he likes it. So now you can begin also. Yes. All the boys and girls are so nicely qualified for Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> They are looking better and better all the time. It's nice for me to see Gurudāsa. He's turning into a mountain. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife has also <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> renounced. Have you seen her latest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has cut hair and white dress, living alone in the temple. <span class="Italic">Vairagya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 6.254]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">vairagya-vidyā,</span> means detachment. That is the perfection of life. If we remain attached, that is conditional. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> has made so many things attractive so that we have to remain attached, and to come out of this attachment is called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So one man, you can sit down, you can eat. Pradyumna, you can eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I've taken some milk before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you don't require. Now you can eat, go on. <span class="Italic">Prasāda prapti mātrena.</span> Our Jayatīrtha <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> is a good manager. Management, looking after. Yes, he's a very good manager, experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's experienced manager.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Not very good managing this place now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Well, it seems okay. Seems to be taken over pretty good. Peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was also managing Los Angeles. Now we have brought him here to see things nicely managed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It feels good, nice vibrations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One thing, Jayatīrtha, why don't you sprinkle this water in this ground?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, we do sprinkle it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just have an ordinary pumping, then it will be green.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's a kind of a limit on the amount of water pressure you can get these days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Limit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> There's been a drought in England, there's no, very little water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is very dangerous. Everything is now yellow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's greener here than most places around, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Everything's so dry this year, lots of trees and things dying without water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the punishment for this age. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> There will be scarcity of rain and there will be scarcity of food and heavy taxation by government. And people will become mad on account of these three things. <span class="Italic">Anāvṛṣṭi, durbhikṣa, karopī.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It's getting dryer in England each year. It's probably going to end up as a desert in another hundred years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They expect like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Well, I don't know. I think the whole world's changing. Somebody said it's the pollution, leaves so much..., there's so much of the oceans now with polluted and with oil on the top, there's not so much evaporation anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not in the ocean. It is the sinful activities of the populace. That is real problem. They are all engaged in sinful activities. Especially this innocent animal killing. These are the all reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In New York they had one island of refuse floated in to shore. For years they were building up island of refuse, and it floated in, and now no one can go to the beaches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samosa.</span> Where is <span class="Italic">samosa</span>? There is only one left?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I'm okay, actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There is sour cream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I've got plenty, thanks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasada,</span> we can eat up to the neck. (laughter) There is no harm. You'll never get indigestion. You have got some fruits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> There's a very nice mango preparation there, did you taste?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Mango.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Oh, this one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One German girl has prepared. We are introducing restaurants like this, and people are liking very much. We have got one restaurant in Hawaii, another restaurant we are organizing in Boston. That is being directly done by Alfred. You have met Alfred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Alfred Ford, the grandson of Henry Ford.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No, I've never met him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He is also a very nice boy. Of course, younger than you. He's only twenty-four years. What is your age now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Thirty-three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty-three. That boy is also very nice young boy. Give Jayatīrtha? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Do you feed everybody who comes Sunday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sunday we have about five hundred to one thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison: :</span>So they must cook for days to feed all those people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, day before, night before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Do they bring food as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They bring grains or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We had a very gorgeous Ratha-yātrā ceremony in New York last Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sunday, eighteenth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pusta Kṛṣṇa:</span> A week ago yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We fed about ten thousand that day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cauliflower. Take little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I can't finish. (laughter) I'm trying to finish one so I can start on the next. I was sick also lately. I had something, I went yellow. I had jaundice. Don't know why, just had food poisoning or something, and it affected my liver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who cooks for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Sometimes me, sometimes, ah.... I don't know, I think we'd had some Chinese food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you should not take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Because I was working as well, so I, you know I think I was pretty tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better you cook simple food yourself and take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> The only thing I could eat was papaya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Papaya is very good, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I still have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him, give him, give him. No, that is the different. Oh, all right. We are just attempting a big planetarium in Māyāpur. We have asked government to acquire land, 350 acres. That is negotiation going on. We shall give a Vedic planetarium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Is that the one you were talking about? With all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the Fifth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> The planetarium will be 350 feet high and show the cosmology of the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The construction will be like your Washington capital, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> A big dome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Estimated eight <span class="Italic">crores</span> of rupees. Is there any <span class="Italic">dahi</span> preparation? Oh, that's all right. Now, there is fruit. You...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Very good. Fantastic. Maybe just a little bit of, but now I'm not.... Thanks. That's fine. No, okay, thanks, fine, that's enough, that's fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That watermelon, you can give. It is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Now let me finish all this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is that mango preparation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You like that preparation? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> We used to have this with milk at Hrsikesa. Every day they'd leave outside of the door. It's good. Do you, Mukunda, break even with all the costs, running cost? Do you do okay with all this food, fruit and stuff?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Oh, yes. More than even. We have about thirteen hundred life members in the Indian community. And then when they come on the weekends they bring food, they bring these hundred pound donations, money in the box.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> At one time you just had the <span class="Italic">Godhead</span> and incense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Yes, now it's all public support.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We don't sell incense anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> And the books we just sell for very little; we hardly make any money on them at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Are you reading sometimes my books? Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Mainly <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the main book. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Mukunda gave me the new books, but there's so much in, ah, there's just so much to read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I don't know how anybody could have written it, it's difficult enough to read all that amount.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes they are surprised how one man can write so many books, but it is Kṛṣṇa's grace. Otherwise not possible. Human being, it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> That one series of books I brought you, the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Hari-śauri? There is no sweet melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> And every single word is written by hand, five hundred years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are in the same house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Hm? Henley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Henley, yes. Very nice house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Hm, very nice. I work from the house. I have a studio, recording studio in the house. So I don't have to go to London anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have all arrangement there. That's very nice. How many acres?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It's about thirty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very good area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Do you get (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Yes, only five hundred pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Really? Amazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Five hundred pounds!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Yes, for four acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> That's quite cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Yes, we were really surprised. But if it hadn't been for that, we'd have had no cow pasture. Cows are out there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got one cow, many cows in Philadelphia. The milk bags, she gives hundred and two pounds daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Of milk? Who owns this? Who milks the cows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Some of the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got tanks for storing milk, tanks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All up-to-date refrigerator and everything. That extra milk they are selling. Similarly, in New Vrindaban we are getting one thousand pounds milk daily. One thousand pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> That's our place in West Virginia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> How many cows? Must be hundred of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the Philadelphia is more organized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Through the nozzles, milk carrying, always hot water is washing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's much better facility in that Pennsylvania place. New Vrindaban's kind of.... They built it up from scratch by themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Rustic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, rustic is the word. (laughter) Pennsylvania they bought this fabulous farm all made up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pradyumna, give him little, this one here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Oh, no, no. Please, no more. I'm really full. I won't have to eat for a few days. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sweets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sweet will help you digest. Don't give three-at least four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I won't be able to eat much more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three is given to the enemy. According to our Indian system, if you give somebody three, that means he is enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Oh, really? I always liked the number three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) You must give at least four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I like three, five, seven, nine. Those numbers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring some fruit. What are the three enemies? <span class="Italic">Kama, krodha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Lobha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Lust, anger, greed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three enemies-lusty desire, anger and greediness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes. But there's a lot of nice threes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Brahma, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. Three worlds, <span class="Italic">śaṅkha, martya, padma.</span> Trinity. These are nice things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> <span class="Italic">Tri-guṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tri-guṇa,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The three modes, they're not so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Well, they're all necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I met, I think, one of your master's other devotees, I forget his name. Gosvāmī, big, in Vṛndāvana, big, tall, with a staff, bald hair. Said you knew his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Puruṣottama?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Puruṣottama? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> In Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Oh, well, the one I met had a staff. Maybe it was a different one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Mādhava Mahārāja maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe Mādhava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He's big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's my Godbrother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes, but he didn't speak English. But all the people I was with said he spoke very good Sanskrit, had a good understanding of Sanskrit. But I couldn't understand anything that he, you know.... I just watched him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I think Puruṣottama Gosāi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's talking of Puruṣottama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Gosāi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's blackish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not fair complexion. Puruṣottama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I think he was fair, but he was very tall, very big, and you know, like this, huge size. You know that place where I stayed the night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That's his place, Puruṣottama Gosāi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He's not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> he is householder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He's married man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes, he had.... His son lived there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> But maybe he's taken, I don't know, I thought he had a <span class="Italic">daṇḍa,</span> one of those staffs. I saw the little temple in the garden, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, where they stay in bed. It's like a bed like this. You know the one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Nidhuvana Mandir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nidhuvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I saw that, where He's been out all night so He doesn't get up until ten o'clock in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not seen our temple since it is inaugurated? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This time you come. Many thousands people come to see daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I saw the photograph, looks really nice. It's big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Now they say it's the most beautiful modern temple in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen our.... There is any film of the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, but there's photographs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We have a nice photograph at the reception room downstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Actually it was half built.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Even the building you went into, there's more, the roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That courtyard is very beautiful. There is a <span class="Italic">tāmala</span> tree. That is a very valuable tree. The Bisanchand Seth asked me to cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What a nonsense, such a.... He has no idea. Now, on account of that tree, it looks so beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It is, it's very wonderful. The whole tree has flourished since the temple began.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We planned the whole temple around that tree. The whole plans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It's a big old tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Tree's just in the courtyard of the temple, so we left it there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Same color as Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">śyāma.</span> Like a fresh rain cloud color. So when Rādhārāṇī sees the tree, She thinks of Kṛṣṇa. So when we see the tree we think of Kṛṣṇa. And Śrīla Prabhupāda sits underneath the tree and watches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhārāṇī in separation was embracing that tree, <span class="Italic">tāmala</span> tree. And they say that in Vṛndāvana, only there are four <span class="Italic">tāmala</span> trees left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, they've said four or six. Very few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Is this tree still living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes, it's alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> My compliments to the chef. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Lemonade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I just took it out. I can get some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring little. So I am very much pleased that you take so much trouble to come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It's my pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, give a little for drinking. You want little more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Are you ever going to stop traveling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. I don't want, personally, but if Kṛṣṇa wants, that is everything. We have got more hundred and two centers, different parts of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Still six more to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter) We have got a very nice house in Detroit. If you sometimes go there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Whereabouts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Detroit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Ah, Detroit. They need one there. Crazy place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Heavy place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That house was constructed fifty years ago at the cost of six million dollars, and we have got it very cheap. Three hundred thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Was it a big house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A very big mansion on the riverside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Colonial house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not as big-four acres of land-but the building is very costly. One room will cost now three hundred thousand dollars. So nicely made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They estimated it would cost about fifteen million to build such a house now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes, they probably wouldn't even bother or be able to, at least. Is it an old house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Fifty years old. It's very solid, though, very good condition as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And on the house on bottom, there is river. Not directly, but an offshoot of river. People come, rowing. A very nice situation, and because it is black quarter, nobody was purchasing. So I said that "For us, what is black or white? Purchase it." So we got very cheap. At that time I paid them hundred and fifty thousand, and (indistinct). So we purchased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Did they find a temple in Hamburg? In Hamburg. I was there once, but they just had a little tiny house, and they were trying to get another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hamburg, I think closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They have a place in Frankfurt, where the devotees are.... Just outside Frankfurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> So they haven't got a place in Hamburg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, it's a heavy city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I was there one year when they were having fights. It's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Rockers. It's a heavy place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Rockers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> It is full of gangs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have got another palace, what is that village?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> South of Paris? That one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, south of Paris. It's near a place called Valancey. Very nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> French chateau.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> It's on about 250 acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Huge fields, beautiful place. Show you a picture of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes. So that's one of the goals now, one hundred and eight temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Should be able to do it this year, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Should have a hundred and eight this year, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Centers. One hundred and eight centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Temples and farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We want worker. Otherwise, Kṛṣṇa is giving us so many centers. In India I can get so many places, but how to manage? Simply taking from persons, and if I cannot manage nicely, that does not look well. Therefore I say first of all get men, then take donation. There is no harm. How many devotees were living here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's about a hundred, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then it is all right. And if there was no devotees, ten devotees, then how could we manage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We have about fifteen devotees that work full time on the grounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the difficulty sprinkling water that quarter? It is costly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We'll try to sprinkle more, but there's a lack of water pressure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, pressure, by pump.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> That's what we have, we had a little Honda pump, but you had to start it off. It's a gasoline engine, I think. And put one pipe into the lake and just pump out of the lake, and then you have a sprinkler on the other side. Makes a noise, though, that's the only thing. Makes a noise and gives off an exhaust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A pump for, say, one hour, two hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> You could use the water out of the lake, then nobody could really complain about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's how we'd have to do it, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> That probably wouldn't be enough, it wouldn't take the level down. How do you fill that up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> That's a natural watershed. This is the lowest place in the area in about four miles every direction. So we have all those underground water tables feeding it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is rain then there is no scarcity of water. The water comes here. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> But how, when you drain it, then how did you stop it from filling up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Well, it did fill up in the winter quite a bit, but then in the summer it went back down. It's filled up now-we had to use city water to get it started. But as soon as it rains it goes up about this far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's evaporated about six inches since</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> You don't have a well in your place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No, just, well, that (indistinct) pond. Originally the lakes all were filled just like this as well as flooding the drains, and when it rained off the house everything would go, and we have a big storage tank, and then there's ball cocks, and underneath that big bank of rhododendrons was like a room built there, which was a storage tank. Then any other water he must have used just from the mains. But these days, you know, they have meters on the mains, so you have to pay for every gallon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> What about getting those water diviners to come and find water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Well, you can find it I think anywhere if you just bore a hole. So what we did was just bore at the end of the lake. But you have to go down to the depth of the riverbed, and there there's not much water because the rain, it's all chalk and limestone, so the rains.... That's the problem with watering in the summer, if you put water...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From your house the river is near?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thames?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Yes. But then the Thames is here, and we're up on the hill, so we bored a hole right down to the three hundred feet, I think, three hundred and fifty feet, to the level of the river, and then a pump, we can pump that. But when it does rain or if you do water the ground, it's so chalky that it runs right through it. So it's hard to keep a lot of moisture in the water. But also at the same time all the rain water runs through, then it hits the rock level of the riverbed, there must be tons of water down there. We can pump out of there all day long for months on end, and nothing seems to dry up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Fantastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> You could even do it by hand if you were out of electricity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> The hole is..., the bore is actually only about this wide. You can have a little bucket. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You have to apply for permission, actually, to dig a well, but around here at least you have to get permission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> We did too. You have to put your name on the list, public notice in the local papers, and if somebody wants to complain about it, then they have a chance to. And once it's been up there for a few days or a week or something, and if nobody's made any formal complaint for any reason, like maybe they've got one and want to bore a hole, and you may be (indistinct) there, so then you just go ahead. Then it's all approved, and then your names goes on the list someplace in the county surveyor's office. So you do have to go through a, you know, a couple of months of waiting. Just to, say, bore a hole to replenish, and you have to just pay for the cost to bore a hole and the pump. To lay out electricity to where the pump is. The pump is, you know, just in the ground, you can't even see it. You know, by that weeping willow tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you want to take little rest, we can arrange for that. Resting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> Rest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you want to rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> You take a rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am taking rest now these twenty-four hours. I have no other business than to take rest. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Always resting at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real rest.</div>
<div class="Verse">kṛṣṇa tvādīya-pada-paṅkaja-pañjarāntam<br class="calibre2"/>adyaiva viśatu me mānasa-rāja-haṁsaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prāṇa-prayāṇa-samaye kapha-vāta-pittaiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kaṇṭhāvarodhana-vidhau smaranaṁ kutas te<br class="calibre2"/>[MM 33]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The <span class="Italic">Mukunda-māla-stotra...</span> There was a big emperor, Samrat(?), Kulaśekhara, emperor Kulaśekhara, he was a great devotee. So he wrote some poetry. Formerly, kings were so advanced, <span class="Italic">rajarṣi.</span> They are king, at the same time, saintly persons. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also it is said <span class="Italic">imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.2]-this science of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was learned by the <span class="Italic">rājarṣis.</span> People were happy therefore. The head, or the executive, they were all saintly persons. So this Kulasekhara, he writes in the beginning of his poetry, "Kṛṣṇa, O Kṛṣṇa..." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa tvādīya-pada-paṅkaja-pañjarāntam.</span> The <span class="Italic">paṅkaja</span> means lotus flower. So Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet is just like lotus flower. The lotus flower has stem down, and the swans, they take pleasure to go down the water and entangled by the stem. Have you seen their pleasure? Yes. That is their great sporting, to be entangled by the stem and come out, in this way, go deep, this is their sporting. So this Kulasekhara is praying, "My Lord Kṛṣṇa, let my swan of mind be entangled with the stem of Your lotus feet." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa tvādīya-pada-paṅkaja-pañjarāntam adyaiva:</span> "Immediately"-<span class="Italic">viśatu</span>-"let enter." Who? <span class="Italic">Adyaiva viśatu me,</span> "My," <span class="Italic">mānasa-rāja-haṁsaḥ,</span> "my mind, which is just like a swan." So why <span class="Italic">adyaiva,</span> immediately? He says that <span class="Italic">prāṇa-prayāṇa-samaye,</span> "At the time of death," <span class="Italic">prāṇa-prayāṇa-samaye kapha-vāta-pittaiḥ,</span> "when the physical condition of the body will be in disorder," <span class="Italic">kapha, pitta, vayu</span> will not be in order.... <span class="Italic">Prāṇa-prayāṇa-samaye kapha-vāta-pittaiḥ kaṇṭhāvarodha,</span> "At that time I shall not be able to speak.

<div class="Purp-para"> "At that time I may be not able to utter 'Kṛṣṇa' or think of You, and now I am healthy, let me finish this business." That means "Let me die immediately. Now I'm healthy, I'm quite fit." This is the ideal. <span class="Italic">Ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ [SB </span>2.1.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> At the time of death, if one remembers Kṛṣṇa, then his life is successful. Immediately he goes to Kṛṣṇa. Just like Ajamila. He chanted "Narayana," and immediately his path to Vaikuntha become clear. So this practice means, whatever we practice all through life, there is chance of coming that remembrance at the time of death, and then it is successful, life is success. If at the time of death one can remember Kṛṣṇa, then his whole life is successful. Our one student, Kārttikeya, his mother was very fortunate. So his mother had nothing to do with this Society, but the boy was attached, and she heard several times "Kṛṣṇa," that this boy is attached to Kṛṣṇa. At the time of her death, she asked her son, "Is your Kṛṣṇa here?" and died. Just see how fortunate she is. She simply uttered this word, "Is your Kṛṣṇa here?" then she died. Very fortunate. So on account of her son she got salvation. Otherwise, Kārttikeya told me that he went to see his mother, and the mother was going to ball dance, and the mother did not receive him well. "All right, you sit down. I'll come again." She was such lady. But by Kṛṣṇa's grace, at the time of death, she inquired her son, "Is your Kṛṣṇa here?" Very fortunate.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa varṇa-dvayī,</span> you have got that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I found that verse. Actually, Rancor found it. <span class="Italic">Tuṇḍe tāṇḍavinī ratim vitanute tuṇḍāvalī-ladbhaye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Pradyumna? You just note down this verse and give him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And the translation is "I do not know how much nectar the two syllables <span class="Italic">'kṛṣ-ṇa'</span> have produced. When the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is chanted, it appears to dance within the mouth. We then desire many, many mouths. When that name enters the holes of the ears, we desire many millions of years. And when the holy name dances in the courtyard of the heart, it conquers the activities of the mind, and therefore all the senses become inert." That was Rupa Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very nice poetry. Read it gain. <span class="Italic">Tuṇḍe tāṇḍavinī...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The English? I don't chant very well. Harikeśa Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you first of all recite. Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tuṇḍe tāṇḍavinī ratiṁ vitanute tuṇḍāvalī-ladbhaye<br class="calibre2"/>karṇa-kroḍa-kaḍambinī ghaṭayate karṇārbudebhyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>spṛhām cetaḥ-prāṅgaṇa-saṅginī vijayate sarvendriyāṇāṁ kṛtiṁ<br class="calibre2"/>no jāne janitā kiyadbhir amṛtaiḥ kṛṣṇeti varṇa-dvayī</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thing you can record and give him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'll make a copy of this tape and give it to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, you should recite very properly, and then it will recorded. Then it will be right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> This is Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, all different states they have got different alphabets, but the Sanskrit is the same. There is no change in Sanskrit. India's culture, all the provinces, they talk a little Sanskrit. If you chant this <span class="Italic">mantra</span> according to the Sanskrit tune, oh, your admirers will take it very nicely. (laughter) And that will be a great benefit to the mass of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> I don't know if they'd like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> They don't understand. Already they don't understand such a lot. Even if you say it in English. Even when you say things to them in English, they don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That word <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa,</span> if they hear, that will be sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> We were in Vṛndāvana, somebody, we were singing, singing in the morning, singing this "<span class="Italic">Jaya Kṛṣṇa.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> And he asked, this person said to me, "You should make it into a song in English." So I wrote English verses, and in each chorus it as "<span class="Italic">jaya kṛṣṇa, jaya kṛṣṇa, kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa, jaya kṛṣṇa, jaya śrī kṛṣṇa; jaya rādhe, jaya rādhe, rādhe, jaya rādhe, jaya śrī rādhe.</span>" I don't know, did you..., if you heard that song. It was on that "Extra Texture"-you know that one? "He who..." I wrote the English words. "He whose eyes have seen what our lives have been, and who we really are-it is He, <span class="Italic">jaya śrī kṛṣṇa.</span>" And then it has a chorus. "He whose sweetness flows to any one of those that cares to look His way, see His smile, <span class="Italic">jaya śrī rādhe,</span>" then the chorus again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> This is on George's new record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> No, it was last year. And "He who is complete, three worlds at His feet, cause of every star, it is He, <span class="Italic">jaya śrī kṛṣṇa.</span>" It's a nice song. But I took the old, the tune that we sang in Vṛndāvana, and just make slightly different, you know, with chords, chord patterns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in your next record, you can give this. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">George Harrison:</span> [break] ...this little girl, he had a baby girl and was trying to think of a name, so I told him to call it Dhara, you know? 'Cause from Rādhā-<span class="Italic">rādhārādhārādhā</span>-it becomes <span class="Italic">dhārā.</span> So he called his girl that name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's a story of Valmiki, you know that story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Maramaramaramaramaramara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Valmiki was a murderer, or a dacoit, thief. So he was met by Nārada Muni, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Valmiki.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And he was advised by Nārada Muni to please chant the holy name of the Lord and give up this thievery. So he wouldn't. So instead Nārada Muni said, "You chant <span class="Italic">mara.</span>" <span class="Italic">Mara</span> means death. So he agreed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Maramara, rāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Later on, this Valmiki, he wrote the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> after having chanting <span class="Italic">rāma, mara,</span> he became purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Transcendental trickery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
