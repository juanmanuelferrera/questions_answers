<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (indistinct)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New York is the dirtiest. New York. There you'll find so many of these papers scattered. In New York. Even the park, the most celebrated park, Central Park, they are all full of dirt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The city is going bankrupt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> New York City.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> America will never go bankrupt so far material prosperity is concerned. Already some people say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no guarantee, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, there is (Hindi, everyone laughs). I'm sorry. Your words. Very, very crafty people in business. Nobody can beat the Americans in business. They are monopolizing the world of business today. The prosperity of America is due to the, all the (indistinct). It is correct. (pause) This is Kali-yuga. People are so faithless, human race has become faithless. They have no faith in God, they no faith in themselves, and then their friends and other human beings also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no. Modern..., not faithless: animals. Yes. <span class="Italic">Dvīpāda paśu,</span> two-legged animals. Yes. They are animal, but two legs. That is the exact word used in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Two-legged animals. <span class="Italic">Dvīpāda, dvīpāda-paśu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think the human race should become all right by getting all these mark from God, all these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on. That is going...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This war, last, second war was so horrible, and the third will perhaps be finishing the whole cosmos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That war is always there. But still they remain two-legged animals. It requires education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sir, I often wonder that Jesus Christ was so wonderful, I mean brotherhood and all these things, and these, practically people following his creed are warring like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, who is following our <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Hm hm, I mean practically why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you blame them? We are also doing. Nobody is following. That is animalism. They have got direction, but they won't follow. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">Jaya! Jaya!</span> Mr. Sar, why don't you come and see how things are going on. You are expert in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Nicely sir. I see it every day. Very good concrete building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if there is any defect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> It is perfectly...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we want to finish this. If you have got any good contact on labor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Contact labor? Labor contact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (some short discussion) We want to finish as soon as possible and give another set of contract. Labor contract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes. I'll try to find out. (some discussion about contractors)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...is the form where the animal can take education and become a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now these human beings they get educated from animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is not education. This <span class="Italic">jara avidya,</span> material education, is no education. It doesn't require any education. This education for eating, sleeping, education, that is not education, that is cats and dogs they also know how to do it without education. Real education is <span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i></span>-this is education. So that is now given up throughout the whole world. Nobody is interested in Brahman; they are simply interested in sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because I think, sir, the method of education the world over is absolutely different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not education. The education for eating, sleeping, that is not education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The way we were educating, our forefathers are educating their children, by this method of sending them to a guru in an <span class="Italic">āśrama...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then they are prepared right from the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī āśrama</span> for the highest goal, till they become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Here he, he's neither this nor there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no education. Real education is not there. Just like Cānakya Paṇḍita, he was not a spiritual man, but he was a prime minister. Still, he gave the standard of becoming educated. He said,</div>
<div class="Verse">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat<br class="calibre2"/>ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Here is <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> What is he? <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu:</span> he sees every woman as mother, except his own wife. And <span class="Italic">para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat:</span> and other's property, possessions, just like garbage. And <span class="Italic">atmavat-sarva bhūteṣu:</span> and feeling for everyone as he himself is feeling the pains and pleasures. If one has attained this stage, then he is considered educated. He never says these degrees. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These degrees are artifacts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">upādhi.</span> Education is to become <span class="Italic">upādhi</span>-less. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> But they are increasing <span class="Italic">upādhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> People think so far as they are concerned that education means giving the knowledge of how to read and write. I think it is the knowledge and not the education. The education is something different, that trains up your mind how to think, how to, I mean, separate grain from the chaff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Education means ethical. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but I mean to say, you must know how to separate the grain from the chaff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins education, instruction. Immediately He puts forward that you are not this body. That is the beginning of education. Where is such education? Everyone is thinking, "You are this body." "You are Indian, you are American, you are Hindu, you are Muslim." What is education? <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says you are not this body. That is the beginning of education. And now education means be nationalist. Drive away and bark...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (something about passport in Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why passport? Even in our country, Mahātmā Gandhi was also infected: "Quit India." "Quit India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, he did not mean quit India. He meant "You quit your matter of ruling." I mean actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was the exact word, "Quit India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You know it more than me, sir, that in 1929 he told Britishers that "You rule India from the basis of they are ruling Canada." So he offered to give them ultimatum. Britishers did know real stuff of India, otherwise they would have acted better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not.... As soon as you think "He is my enemy and he is my friend," then there is no education. That's all. This is standard of education. <span class="Italic">Ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu.</span> That is education. <span class="Italic">Sama darśinaḥ. Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini śuni caiva</span> [Bg. 5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is education. That is.... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">nanu śocanti paṇḍitāḥ. Nanu śocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> "Ah, you are rascal." It is not the business of the <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> to think like that. He never thought that the Kauravas were the enemy. No. That is not the fact. It is duty to fight the just cause. That was His instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mr. Nehru said Kṛṣṇa was the greatest war-monger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) He was saying so. He thought himself to be very big man. He thought himself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone thinks. Everyone thinks. That is asuric position-"Who is like me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (quotes some Sanskrit) That is asuric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">bhakta...</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā.</span> There is no education; therefore Kṛṣṇa has spoken of these people as <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> "No, they are educated. They have passed so many examination"-<span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> This kind of education has no value because they are forgetting the real point of education. <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritaḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So what is <span class="Italic">āsurī,</span> would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āsurī</span> means godlessness. "There is no God; I am God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Believing in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. "There is no God. I am God." What is that beginning? <span class="Italic">Pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca na vidur āsura ajana</span> (sic)<i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.7], and? There is no creator? What is the exact word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Apratiṣṭham.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Apratiṣṭham.</span> There is no cause of this creation. <span class="Italic">Kāma-haitukam:</span> it has taken place just like a man becomes lusty by seeing a woman and he begets a child. This is the cause, this rascal desire. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kiṁ kāma-haitukam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) That is the <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya</span> philosophers. That is their theory. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> come in contact by chance, and there is creation. Not God created. Their theory is, the <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa,</span> they come in contact by chance, and there is creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sir, this <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya</span> philosophy also believes in <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> And <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says <span class="Italic">sa aik sata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya</span> philosophy by the original Kapila, that is on the basis of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> And this later <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya</span> philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Must be some another rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) Now you have learned! (everyone laughs very loudly)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am learning. (laughs raucously)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! There are two <span class="Italic">sāṅkhyas.</span> Kapila. One Kapila is..., therefore he is described everywhere as <span class="Italic">devahūti-putra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kapila, the basis of the yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, yoga is Patanjali. <span class="Italic">Aṣṭāṅga.</span> And yoga is also there in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya</span> is the goal by knowledge, and yoga is by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yoga.... Actually yoga means to keep the mind fixed up, <span class="Italic">yoga indriya samyama,</span> to control the mind and the senses. That is yoga. Then other activities. If your mind is not controlled, you are in disturbed condition, then you cannot perform it. So it is a process to control the mind. And if one is able to control the mind, then he becomes real yogi, and at that time, <span class="Italic">dhyānavasthita,</span> meditation. <span class="Italic">Dhyānavasthita tad gatena manasa paśyanti yaṁ yogi.</span> Then he sees the Paramātmā always. That is perfection of the.... (aside to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> have been spoken out by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> totally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is substance. Summary of all <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He says therefore, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (some muttering in back) <span class="Italic">Ha.</span> He said <span class="Italic">yogo apra...</span> yoga can be caught and lost also. But <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cannot be lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What is the any question of lost? How do you get disjoined with the God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Listen, if you are artificially joined, then you are dejoined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, no. Then it is not yoga at all. Then you stop, automatically (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Once then you say yoga then you are entering. You are not outside it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) There are so many types of yoga, sir, as you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> summarizes, <span class="Italic">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā [Bg. </span>6.47]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is real yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmana sa me yuktatamo mataḥ.</span> That is the highest yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yoga means <span class="Italic">karmendriya-dhāraṇām</span>. Where is the question of yoga...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. When the <span class="Italic">indriya-dhāraṇām</span> is not (indistinct) it becomes (Hindi). Then it is faith, then yoga is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">yoga indriya-śamanam.</span> The result of yoga is control-mind and senses, <span class="Italic">śama, dama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So many types of yoga, even <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is called a yoga. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yoga. Everything is yoga which links up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (talking of a passerby) He used to join, used to join with yoga as (indistinct) with youth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, we shall return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Seven o'clock. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> .... yoga. <span class="Italic">Viyoga, viyoga</span> means disconnected. Yoga and <span class="Italic">viyoga,</span> the opposite is <span class="Italic">viyoga.</span> So <span class="Italic">viyoga</span> is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Separation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhinnā me prakṛti aṣṭadhā [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are connected with this material energy, they are apparently <span class="Italic">viyoga.</span> So we have to attain for yoga. That means turn back again back to Godhead. That is yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He quoted that thing from <span class="Italic">Kathopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogo bhavateo.</span> Yoga can be caught and can be lost. Yoga can be caught and can be lost. So that type of yoga. Not this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is lost, when you are in materially, that is lost. And when you are spiritually joined, that is gained. Yoga and <span class="Italic">viyoga. Tasmād yogī bhavārjuna,</span> Kṛṣṇa says Arjuna to become yogi, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogi.</span></div>

And Prahlāda Mahārāja therefore says that these rascals, they do not know. <span class="Italic">Na te vidhuḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum.</span> These rascals, they do not know what is real self-interest. <span class="Italic">Svārtha-gatim.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are not soul conscious because they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are <span class="Italic">na te vidhuḥ.</span> They are working hard that "This is my interest." But actually that is not his interest.... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The interest of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is not in his interest because it is changing. Suppose a person comes to a foreign place, and he becomes only interested in where he is staying, and after a week he is driven away. Then what is interest? You are eternal; you must have eternal interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That education comes from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we say that there is no education. They do not know what is interest. They are making a small limitation, that "This is my country. My interest is to become a national. I will sacrifice my life for this, that, this..."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> One has to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, jñānam.</span> But they have no knowledge; therefore they are <span class="Italic">śūdra.

That is <span class="Italic">brahma-jña. Brahma jñānārthī brāhmaṇa.</span> So where is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>? All <span class="Italic">śūdras.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised that because all these rascals are filled up all over the world, "Each one of you become a guru." Yes. So many <span class="Italic">gurus</span> required. <span class="Italic">Āmāra ajñāya guru haya tāra ei deśa,</span> wherever you are living, you just try to deliver your family, your neighborhood, your friends.

So why shall I not say? It is not firing; it is telling the truth. (laughs with Patel) But I am not loser. I am, I do not make any compromise. All these my students ask, I never made any compromise.

And execute. That's all. Then he's perfect servant. He doesn't require any qualification. Simply if he's ready, the master will order: "I will do." That's all. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityaja mām ekam,</span> "Be ready always, what I say, direct." And Rūpa Goswami says, <span class="Italic">ānukūlyena-kṛṣṇānu-śilanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">. Ānukūlyena,</span> favorably.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you make tamasic <span class="Italic">dāna,</span> then you become implicated with his sinful activities. Suppose you want to kill somebody, and you're asking, "Can you give me a nice knife?" "What you will do?" "I shall kill that man." "All right, take it, <span class="Italic">dānam.</span> I am giving you in charity." So he will be implicated. In the court, if it is known that that man supplied the knife, "Arrest him. Bring him immediately."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So what do you think about this America has supplied a lot of grain free of charge to this country, and that grain is fed to the whole of this poor population, and they are not God believers?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sattvika dāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The government, Indian government, is in necessity. In necessity, "All right, give it to the government." Their duty is finished. But if the government is rascal, that is their responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But suppose you had given me a knife to mend the pencil, and I stab somebody with it. So, like that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but then the <span class="Italic">dāna</span> that you did was not tamasic. Still, it has ended in tamasic action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything. Just like the money. Money is not material. You can spend it for constructing a temple for Kṛṣṇa. Then it is not material; it is spiritual. Everything originally..., nothing is material. But when it is not used for Kṛṣṇa, that is material. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ tena.... tyaktena bhuñjithā [Īśo mantra 1].</span> If everything is belonging to Kṛṣṇa, how it can be material. He is spirit, so everything belongs to Him, so how it can be material? Material means when Kṛṣṇa's things are not used for Kṛṣṇa, for oneself, that is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that is sin also. Anything which is not...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Immediately. To spiritualize everything, Kṛṣṇa says therefore, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yaj juhosi yat tapasyasi dadāsi.... yat kuruṣva mad arpaṇam.</span> Then it is spiritual.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like government servant, soldiers, they are killing so many; they are not responsible, because he's doing for the government. Police beats you, but he cannot bring any charge against the police. Another man, if he little slaps, you can bring charge, immediately. That is <span class="Italic">tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya.</span> The police and military department, they are doing for the government.</div>

Then the question will be, "Who is nondevotee?" <span class="Italic">Asat-strī-saṅgī kṛṣṇa bhakta...</span> One who is too much attached to material enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Strī-saṅgī</span> is the basic point, and one who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he is <span class="Italic">asat-saṅga. Asat-saṅga-tyāgī...,</span> there are two lines. And the moralist, Cānakya Paṇḍita, he also said, <span class="Italic">kalau durajana samsagyam bhaja sādhu samārgama.</span> You give up something, you must take something. Otherwise you will not be able to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nothing can act independently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, simply negative is useless. These <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they simply teach negative-<span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> But they do not take to Brahman; they simply take the one side, <span class="Italic">jagan mithyā.</span> They take the.... <span class="Italic">Brahmā satyam,</span> take to Brahman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then the second half they are not taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They do not know how to remain in Brahman. No, they do not know; therefore we say rascal. You realize that you are Brahman; now your next business is to stay in Brahman. That they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Behave as Brahman. They don't behave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Either behave or stay, the same thing. Unless you become fire, you cannot stay in fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these people, they realize <span class="Italic">arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padam [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> By severe austerity and penances they rise to the Brahman platform, but from there they fall down. Why? <span class="Italic">Adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ.</span> Because <span class="Italic">brahmam</span> platform means to be engaged in devotional service. <span class="Italic">Brahma bhūyāya kalpate. Mām ca yo'vyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena</span> [Bg. 14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to stay on the <span class="Italic">Brahmam</span> platform, then you must render service to Kṛṣṇa. And if you simply realize that "I am Brahman," then you'll be misguided by <span class="Italic">māyā:</span> "Oh, you are the Supreme Lord. You are Bhagavān. What is the use of worshiping another Bhagavān? You are Bhagavān." <span class="Italic">māyā</span> says it in a different way. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> says that you are a rascal, but think that you are Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This <span class="Italic">ātmarāma</span> supposed to be tolerant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the rascals, under the dictation of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> they are thinking "I am God," that's all. They have no intelligence even, that "How I can be God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, even Śaṅkarācārya has taught the <span class="Italic">kuru-bhakti.</span> But these rascals who are following Śaṅkarācārya, they are not following correctly. He was doing <span class="Italic">bhakti, bhaja govindam</span> he has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govinda...</span> He has asked, <span class="Italic">mūḍha-mate.</span> One who is rascal, he does not worship Govinda. In this he says, "You rascal, <span class="Italic">nahi nahi rakṣati duḥkṛṅ karaṇe, prāpte sannite koro marame.</span> You have learned so much grammar, grammatical jugglery to interpret <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> in this way, that way. These things will not help you at the time of your death. You rascal, <span class="Italic">bhaja govindaṁ.</span>" <span class="Italic">Bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ mūḍha-mate.</span> "You rascal!" He says <span class="Italic">mūḍha!</span> (everyone laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think the modern philosophers are misinterpreting the Śaṅkarācārya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> They want to remain <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> That is their fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are not <span class="Italic">sama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkarācārya, because he had to deliver people from this <span class="Italic">nāstika</span> philosophy, <span class="Italic">bauddha,</span> so for the time being, he made some compromise. The bauddha says there is no God, and he said, "Yes, there is no God. You are God." So if he realizes himself <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> then he'll be engaged in devotional service, that was his purpose. Unless he says that, that "Yes, it is not the fact that there is no God. There is God, but that God you are."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the final argument is that if there is no God, who said there is no God? And that is God. That is what he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) So you know better than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. I did not know this, I read it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I know, what is his policy? His policy was to make this godless men to think of God, that "I am God." That is.... Let him be accustomed with the word God, then gradually he will understand. It is called <span class="Italic">ahaṅgrahopāsana. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> Therefore I shall worship myself. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅgrahopāsana Nikatena, jagatena, ekatena.</span> It is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, ekatena.</span> That "I am Brahma. So I shall worship myself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but he had also mentioned about <span class="Italic">bhuma puruṣa.</span> That there is really a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is, but this is one of the beginning stage, <span class="Italic">ekatena.</span> "I am one," monism. <span class="Italic">Ekatena tena bauddha visatum aham.</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That passage, <span class="Italic">ekatena bahutena bahuda visato mukham(?)</span> That passage comprises all of the philosophies of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Pantheism, monism, dualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And qualifies, I mean.... Somebody has very well commented on that particular <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> giving all the views of Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Jīva(?)<span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> and all the modern.... Somewhere I read, I don't know where, on that particular <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> After all these things, <span class="Italic">ācārya, ācārya para...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācāryopāsanam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) Without <span class="Italic">ācārya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.</span> One who has accepted <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> he knows, he knows. Now our these European and American boys are preaching in South India, big, big <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they have received them. Because they know that these boys know; latest letter. Hare Kṛṣṇa! (end)</div>
