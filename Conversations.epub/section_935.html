<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> n-a-m.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> n-a-m?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> j-ñ-a.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Is it hyphenated? <span class="Italic">Sa,</span> hyphen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have given you spelling. Or Pradyumna can give it to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is very artistic also, very nice, literature, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>And in bracket you can give "In Scientific Knowledge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> "In Scientific Knowledge." In English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. (in room) Make that attempt. Then they will know, "Yes America." So these pictures are available to be seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I think today they will, by this evening, they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I took about... Well, one boy is doing it for free of charge, he's producing ten of them just to get idea. If we want more, we can get more. I took about twenty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All detailed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Some detail, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. Yes, you can close. (door closes) One set to Gargamuni and one set to Saurabha and one set for me, three sets. And if you like, you can keep one set for you. The negative will be with you. What is the height altogether?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Actually, I don't know, I didn't get that. I can get that information also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, guessing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Oh, I don't know, two hundred fifty feet? Something like that. Three hundred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That's too big, three hundred. The Washington monument is five hundred fifty feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Maybe two hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Maybe a hundred seventy-five. We can check reference book easily. You'll find out today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we want to make a chart. Now from these gross elements, the five gross elements, we want to extend to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Earth, water, air, fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From there we want to include the, let's say this table, ninety-two..., what scientists call elements, this gold, silver, copper, all these elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is within earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we are thinking that not only earth, but the water, air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the earth, there is already water, air, ether, fire, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> From previous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Earth is the reservoir of all elements. As you go from earth to water, one is minus. From water, you go to fire, one is again minus. In this way, when you go up, ether, there is only one. And earth contains all the five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> All the five gross elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So actually we can use just from earth all these ninety-two elements, like silver, gold...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is in the earth. So many varieties of mixture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Now is there an atom for each? Is there a copper atom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we do not take care of atoms, we take gross estimation. Must be atomic differences. Just like gold and mercury, little atomic difference. And it is suggested that tin, copper, and mercury, proportionately mixed it will become gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Once you told me that in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now you can do that experiment. Then our poverty will be... (laughter) It is fact. There are many yogis, they prepare gold by drinking mercury. They drink mercury, overnight, next morning they pass urine and dip copper coins in it. And then after some time the copper coins put into the fire, it becomes gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's alchemist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, they do that. But it is a fact that copper and tin and mercury proportionately mixed will produce gold.</div>
<div class="Verse">yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti<br class="calibre2"/>kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena<br class="calibre2"/>dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This example is given by Sanātana Gosvāmī. As <span class="Italic">kaṁsa... Kaṁsa</span> is mixture of copper and tin, bell metal. When it is properly treated with mercury, it becomes gold. Similarly, a human being properly treated by initiation, he becomes a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This example has been given by Sanātana Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām. Nṛṇām,</span> he says, "of all human beings." He doesn't say a particular class or particular country. <span class="Italic">Śuddhyanti prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.</span> Everyone can be purified by the initiation process, by expert spiritual master. That is accepted in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> These elements, that science calls elements, gold and mercury, are these several other elements in the Vedic scriptures? Little information how they separate it, the technique they use...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that, that is not given. But they, all these metals, they are different forms of earth. You find in ores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they are all impure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, you have to purify, but they are in the group of earth. We have to purify. Gold is also purified. It is taken from the mine, it is not pure gold. You have to treat it, then pure gold comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But that treatment must involve a lot of process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be, but by treating you can get, that's all. The metallurgists, they know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. So actually the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> must have known these techniques, because otherwise they cannot get this gold so easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are gold mountains also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mount Sumeru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are gold mountains, silver mountains, iron mountains, copper road, everything is there. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is a new picture of Mars, just came in the Washington Post today. Here is what the scientists say the mountains are on Mars. Big crater they are talking about. This is a recent photo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? What do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Says it's a Grand Canyon. Just like in Arizona there's a canyon called Grand Canyon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So might be from Arizona? (laughter) Like Arizona, that means Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Just like Arizona, the same rocks you find in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is called Martian Grand Canyon, and an ocean meandering gorge ten times the size of Arizona's Grand Canyon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we can photograph it and make ten times, hundred times. Their business is in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is only the propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I agree. I think it was all like a movie set.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. They are not going. Arizona is there, only accept. Why they are taking Arizona? That means they are in Arizona. Just like one man was stealing from the room, and there were some sounds, and the master of the house said "Who is there? What is that sound?" The man said, "No, I am not stealing. No, no I am not stealing." It is like that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Throughout this article they make comparisons with earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is no man. Just see the foolishness. The same logic, "No, no, I am not stealing." Who asked that you are stealing? He asked for the sound, but he disclosed. It is like that. Why they are bringing Arizona?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you catch them red-handed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, that I can do. It is like that. Who asked them to speak of Arizona? You are speaking of Arizona. "No, no, I am not stealing." (laughter) It is like that. They could have mentioned other places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Arizona is convenient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are working in Arizona. The mind is there. Arizona-minded because they are working in Arizona, so they are disclosing mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they are claiming that this photograph was taken two hundred million miles away from the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, they can say anything, but they are doing everything in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> What is the point then, Prabhupāda? Just to take money and use it some other way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, just to cheat people that they are very big scientists, give them fat salary. That's all. But what people will benefit by this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They want to study whether there is life there or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is life, you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are not sure yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is life everywhere. We can say from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> There cannot be any place vacant. It is not possible. Must be life there. All planets are vacant, simply this planet is congested, overpopulation. What is this nonsense? What is the difference between this planet and other planets, chemically or physiologically?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say there are differences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Differences, that may be little, the difference between cat's body, dog's body, man's body, little difference must be there. But the elements are the same. At least, I'll not believe. No, I am not blind, but in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> every planet is congested. That is in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, actually we also have some information even in science that there must be life there in other planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I, he was of my age, perhaps you know his name, Dr. Shah? So he was my friend in Allahabad. So he said, "No there is life." He said, Dr. Menga Shah(?). There is no question of disbelieving, he said, and he is also big scientists, Dr. Menga Shah (?), Dr. Megha-kunda(?), they were all my customers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's in U.P.?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> U.P., Allahabad. The Jawaharlal Nehru, he was very big, big customer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There are in fact some reports in the last few years that there is some bacteria that can survive in the medium of ammonia-ammonia is alkaline solution. Normally life survives in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Life survives in fire, water, fire. That is our information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Also they proved that there are certain bacteria that can survive in about a 170 degrees. High temperature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why bacteria? Human beings. Otherwise, how Kṛṣṇa is speaking the sun-god? <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply the sun-god is alone living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the sun planet there are living entities. Their body is made of fire, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So it's better to say that when science says, scientists say there is no life in other planets, we can conclude that the senses or the forms that we have, or the elements that we have different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are different. Just like in the water, superficially we don't see any living being. But inside you go, there are many millions of living entities. They took photograph. What is the meaning of photograph from such a distance? If you take photograph of the sea, what you will find? It is vacant. So the rascals are taking photograph, and I have to believe it. Photograph, what is the meaning of photograph? There is no meaning. Take the photograph of the sea, if I know what is there. Then go deep into the water, you'll find millions and trillions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> There are also living entities living in the air that we can't see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can't see so many things. What is the value of your eyes? Why do you believe so much your eyes? You cannot see even your eyelids, so close. Still, you are blind. When there is some particle, you cannot see. You have to struggle how to get out this particle. If you see, then take it. So what is the value of your eyes? Why do you believe so much? <span class="Italic">Adhyakṣa,</span> they are called <span class="Italic">adhyakṣa, o</span>nly believe in direct perception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him come. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Getting French visa was done, and tomorrow I pick up your passport and apply for Iran visa. Then just one more, Italy, remains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do they speak about seeing? What is the value of your seeing? I have seen the Atlantic Ocean, that means I have seen everything? This is ludicrous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They may simply speculate from a distance, that "Here is the surface," like here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Real business is speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Here it says, here, this is some great, here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is "I am not stealing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Twelve hundred miles above the surface. Now they want to speculate what is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who asked him that who is stealing? But he said "I am not stealing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is perfect, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he brings Arizona? Who asked him? That means that their business in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They have exposed themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascals, how they are cheating people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Such a big hoax. They have spent billions of dollars for such a hoax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you consider whether I am right or wrong. The moon planet is also Arizona. (laughs) All their business asset is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So one of the things we want to do is expose this cheating. Should we expose this kind of thing directly like this, or should we indirectly deal with it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you do scientifically. I give you the hint. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If we say that, they will be mad at the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give psychology. Say "Who asked him about Arizona? Why he is speaking Arizona?" That means they are in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So. Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it all right to include that, these ninety-two chemical elements as finer, er, finer form of earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mixture of so many things. But actually, that is the fact. Just like iron, gold, everything you find. Just like earth, but you have to purify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So earth is a mixture of all these different elements?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So we can call this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different quality of earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Like subcategory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually, in water also, all these, most of these earth materials are there, because it dissolves in water. Water is so many salts and elements, in a dissolved form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I told you, that in the earth all other five elements are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So water precedes earth in the creation. Water comes first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, ether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I mean water comes before earth. Earth is last, and water is just before. So that we find earth in water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water it dries up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's saying you can find earth in water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That's the point you made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am stating, that when water dries up, we find deposits of earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes, because it precedes, and earth is being created from water, so you'll find earth in water originally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But still water is one element less than earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, earth is full of all elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What he is saying is back to front then. If earth has all the elements in it, then the other one says you go successively back, should have one less. So why is it water has earth in it when earth is the last one to be produced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not visible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Oh, it's not manifest</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, not manifest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So earth is in a nonmanifest state in the water, and when you analyze water sometimes you can analyze and produce little particles of earth. Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Everything is there. Not prominent, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So the main characteristic then is the water that is prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the skin, you cannot find water, but there is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So earth is prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you cut the skin, the blood will come. What is the blood? That is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> That is mineral water, it has minerals in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be, but it is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually, the composition of that particular element is predominant. When we say water, say there are some minerals, but the mineral percentage-wise is very less, but the percentage of water of more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> There is no pure water. Can there be pure water, completely pure water? If we analyze, we will find pure water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing can be pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Not in this material world. They say that they distill it, but just like they say fire is pure, but fire is not pure. There are living entities living in the fire. They have gross, grossly defined...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sterilization has no meaning. The living entity will stay. Otherwise, how it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ</span>? Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You were saying yesterday that in all state of matter there is always some living condition to be found. Even in a body that is supposed to be dead, there is life coming from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually when the body dies, we say that it decomposes, actually that decomposition is done by small microbes. These microbes at this big body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They become prominent, that's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Light. Fire means heat and light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What is magnetism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Magnetism also another action of the fire. We used to do that. Rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Electricity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Friction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it would, get one fine paper, you'll get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hairs will stand on end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So magnetism means another action of the fire. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We talk sometimes things very complicated, Śrīla Prabhupāda, but Prabhupāda explains it very simply. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I am not scientist. (laughter) Just like I captured immediately, common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In one of the articles in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> I think Dharmādhyakṣa, he uses different words for these five elements. So we are going to use these elements in our book also, so we wonder, he says for fire "radiant energy" instead of fire. I think it may sound little more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They think this is so simplistic, you know, mythological-type breakdown, oversimplification. So he used different words, fire he said "radiant energy," water he said "liquidity." What did he say for earth? "Solid matter" he said for earth, and air, "gas." And what did he say for ether? "Space." So we thought, we were wondering if these were acceptable terms to use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I, actually I discussed this point last time, but still I want to make it clear. The difference between life and matter again...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Life and matter, is, we already explained very clearly. There is no symptom of matter in life. Everything is detailed. <span class="Italic">Nainaṁ chindanti śastrāṇi.</span> Negative way. "It is not this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But to feel it, to see it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot bring it to any material platform. Everything is denied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Now to make a simile or comparison, we found from our experience in science that matter itself is rather very simple. It is composed of simple patterns and simple forms and structures. But now when this matter is touched by life or matter in association with life, is actually very complex in terms of molecules. It comes to big molecules, and the molecules not only big. It's very complex, highly complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can understand, just the one grain of poison, potassium cyanide. You touch on your tongue, immediately whole body becomes poisoned. How the molecules spread immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How does it react? Potassium cyanide? It blocks the oxygen path? That's what science says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, the poison action immediately spreads all over the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Otherwise, why is it happening like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is also material. Now how much powerful is spirit soul, you can just imagine. If one grain of matter has got so much potency, how much potency has got the spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But then somebody may ask that why that cyanide..., cyanide is just material. But now in the living body the spirit is there, but how is spirit affected by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit is unable to live. The condition changes. Poison means the condition changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So cyanide is more powerful than the spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Powerful, this is different element. Powerful, it is, certainly, because it is moving the whole thing. Powerful, that particular body is destroyed. But the spirit soul, there are so many, otherwise how the germs are coming? It is not powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When cyanide is introduced the body becomes unsuitable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For a particular soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Now my point, coming to this complex form, now matter it is understood easily in terms of science, when matter is associated with life, then comparing this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the matter works. Otherwise it has no working capacity. <span class="Italic">Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat</span> [Bg. 7.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> The material world is working on account of the presence of the spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From here, from this experience, we are extending that the spiritual world is, spirit itself is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's different from material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has nothing to do with the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is this valid to conclude that spirit, spiritual world, or life is very complex?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not complex, it is simply spirit. In the material world it is complex. In the spiritual world, it is simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Is it all right? Is it understood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Spirit means completely different from matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> The whole idea is that the matter, where it's not touched by spirit, it's not very complicated. When there's life, then you have such a complication like a body. The human body is very complicated because life is there. Without life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just like a machine, it can be complicated. But as soon as you put the plug, <span class="Italic">gada-gada-gada-gada </span>comes. But the electricity is not complicated, the machine is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So it doesn't work unless there is some....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without electricity it does not work. But the machine is complicated, not the electricity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> One thing is that the machine, in this example, gets complicated or it becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Complicated means it is made in different parts with matter, that's all. But it cannot work without the electric power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So the conclusion is that matter, when touched by life or spirit, actually it becomes complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not complicated, it is already complicated. It works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, matter itself is not complicated. Matter itself is not complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, complicated. When they are combined together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Even if it is complicated, this matter itself touched by life is more complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like electricity. Electricity, when it is connected with the machine, it works. The machine is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it could be said that the machine is actually independent of the electricity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how it is independent? Without electricity it has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has no value, but it's still existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Existing, that is valuable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But machine is touched by a person. So that makes a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is an example, that here is electricity, power, and here is machine. The machine is complicated. The electricity is not complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if there's no electricity, then there's no need for a complicated machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see it is complicated. Even a typewriter machine, it is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then it's only complicated because it needs to be so so that it can take the energy for running it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, without electric, without energy, it cannot work, but the thing itself is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can I ask one question? If life is based on the desires of the living entities, and as you were mentioning that the material energy forms so many complex combinations, the material body is so complex, does that mean that the living entity is very much entangled?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you analyze your body, so many complications. But without life it is all dead matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, that is why we are concluding that matter, when it is associated with life, it is very complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Without matter, it is complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Without life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Without life it's more complex, matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the same, the matter is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Same body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Well in a sense, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no sense, try to understand. The body is complicated. But in spite of all this, it is useless unless there is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> All right, so then in an embryo stage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any stage, it is, the whole thing is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you are saying that the soul is actually by nature very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least compared to the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The soul is not complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> I believe what Svarūpa Dāmodara Prabhu is saying is that matter, each element studied by itself, has a simple structure, but when the body is formed with the soul, then it becomes apparently more complex; the chemical reactions become more complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> As a matter of growth even. Because life is present, then this small pea grows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means that soul is not complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, not the soul. But that the presence of the soul causes growth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the dictaphone. The dictaphone is complicated, but my finger is not complicated. Finger is simple. I simply push, and it works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So, I'm comparing two matters in two different states. Now matter as such and the matter with life. Now taking that life is simple, now still there is a basic difference between matter not touched by life and this matter touched by life. And matter which is not touched by life is still simpler than this matter which is touched by life. Now taking that life is simple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are speaking like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's what we see in science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This machine is the same without electricity or no electric. But with electricity it works, and without electricity it is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But isn't a complicated body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is complicated already. When it is touched with electric power it works. And when it is not touched with electricity... The electricity is not complicated, this thing itself is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But isn't the complexity of the body due to trying to accommodate the desires of the spirit soul? Such a complicated body is there because the spirit soul desires to do something. So the complexity is a product of the desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you want to do something, different machine, but the power is the same. You want to, we use a dictaphone or a typewriter, you want to use a, so many, so many... The complication is of the matter, but the electricity is the same. Either this machine or that machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In mathematics...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't bring mathematics, try to understand. You have got different machine for different purposes. But without electricity they are useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So the cause is very simple, but the effect is complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not effect. It has nothing to do. If you want to work for a certain purpose, you require such and such machine. So different purposes, different machines. But the power is the same. It is a simple thing. Why don't you understand? You push the electric power for this heater and same electric power for this cooler. This is the difference of the machine. The power is the same. Either it is acting as cooler or heater. The refrigerator is used, the same electric power. And the heater is used, same electric power. It is a question of difference of the machine. Electricity is the same. The matter is complicated. Spirit is not complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Just like in a body that is growing and getting bigger, that's because the spirit soul is present, and there's action going on because the spirit soul is there. So in that sense a body may become bigger and more complex because the spirit soul is present in that body. That is what we were trying to say, that this matter can become even more complex, if we can use that word, or variegated, because the presence of the spirit soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have to take help of the spirit soul to work the matter. Otherwise matter is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually matter becomes more complicated when it is in association with life. That is actually what we want to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> We were speaking not of the spirit soul, we're saying designed by God. That's the kind of life we were referring to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just like the material energy in its unmanifested state, when it's <span class="Italic">pradhāna,</span> there's no living entity present. But when the living entity is put into the material energy by God, then the whole complex system of workings in the material world come into being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> What we're trying to show is that such complex activity cannot go on without the presence of life. And with life there, spirit soul, movements are going to go in this material world. That's our point. Isn't that the point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. One thing also, in the spiritual world, it is full of variegatedness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is spiritual variety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Spiritual variety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That doesn't mean that it is complex, Śrīla Prabhupāda, yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no complexity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> One point, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that matter as it is, it has not even a specific form or pattern as compared with matter associated with life. When matter is associated with life it has specific groups of forms meant for a definite purpose and function. Now this is lacking when matter is left as it is. For example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, matter is utilized for the purpose of spirit soul. Otherwise matter has no independent existence. The whole thing is matter, but it is formed according to the desire of the spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So if matter is inferior to the spirit soul, then isn't it correct to say that the spirit soul is more complex or sophisticated than matter? If matter is inferior?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit soul is living. Naturally he has got desires. That is not complexity. That is a symptom of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Matter has no desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So matter seems, we say, more complex, but still is inferior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is made complex to serve some purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It keeps the living entity forgetful of Kṛṣṇa. It makes <span class="Italic">māyā</span> for the living entity; he forgets Kṛṣṇa with all the complexities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Physically, everything is being done by heat and light. So fire is heat and light. The fire is not complex, heat and light but with heat and light everything is going on. You have physical subject matter of study, heat and light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because everything is being conducted by heat and light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So the living entity's desire has become very complex due to his association with material nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not desire. He desires, and the matter helps. In the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That desire is simple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Desire is simple, that is his... Otherwise, without desire, how he is living? You make minus desire, then how it is living? That is only symptom of his living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You have said on your original record that the living entity is trying to enjoy material nature but is becoming more and more entangled in her complexities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Becoming entangled in the machine. Because he has forgotten his spiritual identity. He thinks "With this machine I can help myself." That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In a sense, it is also true that in the material world, especially material scientists, they make things more complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The contamination of material desires. But when one develops spiritual desire, then he becomes more simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma-bandha.</span> That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ anyatra karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9],</span> to become entangled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So for a <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> if you ask what is the purpose of life it is a very complicated question. For a devotee, it is a very simple question with a simple answer. It is very complicated, they will answer, "Oh, this is very difficult, we cannot discuss this in this class, this is too complex." That is the answer we got all our lives until we came to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Then you answered very simply-Kṛṣṇa. (devotee offer obeisances, door opens) Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Thank you for explaining these... (inaudible) (end)</div>
