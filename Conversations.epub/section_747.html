<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their civilization begins from monkey, and our civilization begins from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> From <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Brahma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> From Brahmā actually when he learned the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those four or five, five or four <span class="Italic">ślokas,</span> original of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> I want to learn from you. I read all the commentary-you have written commentary for four pages-but I think I am little <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> to understand it. (laughing) So I'll learn directly if you can teach me. I am now critically studying your, this thing, commentary on this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Once I read it, but now I am doing a critical study of it. Both of Sanskrit as well as your comments. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...divided by separate words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is written in purport too much (Sanskrit). The combination of this word is so difficult...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...recommended to study <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> from <span class="Italic">bhāgavata,</span> not by grammar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. But unless, I mean, I like Sanskrit myself, so I try to learn Sanskrit; I can read other, more Sanskrit books. So it is a sort of a study with me, as well as a knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> So I am trying to be more critical about it. But that way I have read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> in Gujarati, even in Hindi (indistinct) Gorhakpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> is (indistinct) from <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> It is very easy. Extremely easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! (to passerby)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Some of the, some people try to poke at us also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, because we, we chant God's name, out of fun they also say. But we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That we should not take it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one chants Hare Kṛṣṇa jokingly, that is also good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's it. Yesterday morning you came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I thought you were coming tonight. Because you, your letter has come that you reach on the (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? God says "Let there be creation," and there was creation. Why three months?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ah, that is, we are not... (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says "Let there be creation"; there was creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was the will of God, so this is also the will of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here you see, God says, "You come here," immediately you come. "You go there," immediately you go there. (Dr. Patel laughs loudly) You cannot bring the water by your scientific process, immediately. But when God says "Immediately"-within a second. (sound of waves in background) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am going to give you a small piece of news. My, that small daughter, she also took first-class, first distinction name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">bolo</span>(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She also stood first. My son also stood first and got the gold medal. She also got the same, by your grace!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) By Kṛṣṇa's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is unique perfomance in Bombay, that no doctor's two children have got first like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. All of them, M.D.?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> M.D. Very distinguished, first class. I was very much pleased... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...one is animal. So animal means ferocious. <span class="Italic">Dharmeṇa yena pasave samānaḥ.</span> They're as good as animal. You cannot expect any good behavior from animals. This is going on. They want to keep the whole population animal, and they're making big, big plans-United Nations, this, that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is a problem. It's committed from the poor nations of the world, this United Nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no education for making people a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Karl Marx, Hagel and Engels and those people have got this nonsensical idea that interaction of matter itself produces what we call consciousness. It is not the consciousness which I mean agrees with the matter. The very first basis on which this rascaldom is, I mean the basis is this: revolting against the tenets of Hindu teaching. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hindu-Muslim teaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I mean <span class="Italic">sanātana dharma</span> of this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sanātana dharma,</span> there is no teaching; it is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, that's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This concoction has come out from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, everywhere. In your country also there are so many parties...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Karl Marx...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Karl Marx maybe. Even your Gandhi-ism, that is also concoction. Gandhi invented nonviolence; it is also concoction. It is impossible. Everyone is doing this-something manufacturing. That is not <span class="Italic">sanātana dharma. Sanātana dharma</span> is never manufactured. It is already there. You have to accept it, that's all. Otherwise everyone is manufacturing some conncoction. This is going on. Kṛṣṇa is teaching, "Fight." And Gandhi is teaching from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> nonviolence. Just see! Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The will of God is the real thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. His will is supreme. Whatever He says, that's all. As soon as you manufacture, everything is spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is fractured by man instead of manufacturing. Fractured, broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānas te'pisa-tantryam uru-damni baddhaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. Pisa tantrya,</span> under the laws of God or nature, everyone is tied, hands and legs, and he's thinking independently, "I can do that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But slowly and slowly, sir, the modern science is trying to prove that <span class="Italic">sanātana dharma,</span> the existence of God everywhere. Which in our times, if we respect scientists for their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They are trying to prove" means so long they are rascals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are rascals. I quite agree with you. You have caught my rascals. (both laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you say "progressing," that means they are rascals. Unless one is rascal, what is the meaning of progress? Hm? Rascal requires progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Whether they do progress or regress we don't know, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that progress means still rascals. After ten years they'll make no... This is progress. So they have no standard knowledge, and that is very much palatable, modern progress. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sincerely by all these six, six, I mean <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> I mean what you call <span class="Italic">darśanals</span>(?), our forefathers have realized God, by all the six methods of <span class="Italic">darśanas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, why your forefathers? Everyone's forefather can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. Other civilized people's forefathers. (laughs) The Āryan race. <span class="Italic">Nyāya vaiśeṣika</span> also has told the same thing. This, such <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> I mean <span class="Italic">darśanas,</span> are all from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> They are all from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are not strictly <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> They are partial. Just like <span class="Italic">mimāṁsa.</span> They say that you do good work and you get the result. That is godlessness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma-mimāṁsa, karma-kāṇḍīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But a <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍī</span> is one of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "There is no need of God. You do your duty."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And God will do His duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "God is obliged to give you the award." That is their philosophy. We can practically see: suppose two men working very hard, are they getting the same result?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, that is their <span class="Italic">karma bandhana...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! (greeting a few people) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Your explanation of this is so very wonderful about the all <span class="Italic">muktas</span> and <span class="Italic">baddha jīvas</span> in the beginning, I mean the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> that even people, whether to remain <span class="Italic">mukta</span> or <span class="Italic">baddha.</span> And then when they became <span class="Italic">baddha,</span> they were overtaken by the lower <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And then this is the whole cosmos. So gravely I have understood this, just this is my second reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhuliyā jīve bhagavān akore kari pasate māyā ta're japatiyā kare.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think this one commentary is Jīva Goswami's. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jīva... Not Jīva Goswami. There are... I consult so many others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This commentary is Rūpa Goswami or Jīva Goswami? Jīva Goswami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got Viśvanātha Cakravartī also. Śrīdhara Swami, Birarāghava, Vijayadvaja. Hare Kṛṣṇa! (to passerby who loudly greets and has Hindi exchange)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This man is seventy years old. (more exchange of greetings) He is sixty-eight, sixty-nine years. He will be eighty years, (laughing) he wants to remain young that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Healthy, he's quite healthy. (Hindi conversation with other man) We repeat simply Kṛṣṇa's statement. That is our... Our mission is "Kṛṣṇa's standard"-<span class="Italic">yare dekha tare kaha kṛṣṇa upadeśa.</span> This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Don't manufacture, rascaldom. Simply repeat what Kṛṣṇa has said. And it is simple. And as soon as you try to manufacture, it becomes difficult. How Caitanya Mahāprabhu has made things so easy.</div>
<div class="Verse">amara ajnaya guru haya tare ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/> yare dekha, tare kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">That's all. How simple it is. You, every one of us, we take this missionary activities of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we see immediately the face of the country will change. Every gentleman, every sane man, may speak to his family, to his community, to his nation, to his friend, what Kṛṣṇa has said. Then see the result. But they're all manufacturing, conncocting. Becoming big scholars. The more you deviate from Kṛṣṇa's instructions, you become a scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean the industrial revolution has really produced a sort of a turmoil in the social set-up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because the machine has produced good, and the benefit has been taken over by the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ugra, ugra.</span> This has been described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">ugra karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ugra karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instead of making life simplified, they have made it a turmoil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then the whole society has been so entangled in this things. Independently (indistinct). In this way this industrialization, raising of the wants of men, and then production for the fulfilling of their wants. Only men engaged all the twenty-four hours in this fulfillment of the wants. All the machines are grinding for that. Production of the goods, not for the good... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Karl Marx, why not others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Karl Marx is the grandfather of all of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who is concocting, he is an <span class="Italic">āsura.</span> Hm? <span class="Italic">Na vidur āsura ajana</span> (sic). <span class="Italic">Pravitti ca nivṛtti ca na vidur āsura ajana</span> (sic).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Sanskrit) That is what they want. If they are competing with each other from tomorrow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> [break] No. Why Karl Marx? Your Vivekananda says <span class="Italic">yata mat tata patha:</span> whatever you manufacture, that is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is because you are struck by the utter poverty of the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was temporary, you see. Because here Karl Marx wanted it permanent, and...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...of the life. I talk of the maintenance of the body. To maintain the body Karl Marx put up this theory and, I mean, spoiled the whole thing-whole society and social set-up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi to a passerby) Everyone is manufacturing; that is my point. Either Karl Marx or this one or that one, everyone is manufacturing. No one is taking the instruction. And our mission is "Take instruction of Kṛṣṇa." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We don't manufacture like nonsense. What you'll manufacture? You are imperfect, your senses are imperfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are manufacturing only for the body, but all these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing you can manufacture, even in the body. You are medical practitioner, hundreds of men you see, different types of body. Is it not? You cannot say that this is the standard." <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgasya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu.</span> The actual disease is the contamination of the <span class="Italic">guṇa.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another ignorance. That is another ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These fellows... That is what I said. That they are ignorant because they are only doing anything for the body and not for the soul.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We tolerate everything. (more Hindi) The whole civilization, the modern civilization, is wholly at fault. Unfortunate. And that is the schools we are sending our children to, and these are the public schools.</div>
