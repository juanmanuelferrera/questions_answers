<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, they're not coconut palms. Just regular palm trees. They have some kernel or something, palm kernel. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...killed the Gardhabhāsura in the palm forest. The fruit is so tasteful but the cowherds boy could not enter the forest on account of this demon.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Dhenukāsura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dhenuka... Not Dhenukāsura. Gardhabhāsura. Dhenukāsura also, they come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That was that ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ass, ass, yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Here there are many date palms, very high producer of dates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. In the desert there are so nice fruit.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He provides. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Bahulāśva? I have read that your program. What is that? College of Vedic Science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the actual program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That was not completed, Prabhupāda. That's just a description of the courses. Yet we have to add a biography about Your Divine Grace, description of the disciplic succession, the activities of ISKCON, and how the college relates to ISKCON. That was simply an explanation of what courses would be given and how they would be structured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. [break] How it will be conducted? The idea is very nice. Who has analyzed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Who has...? Dharmādhyakṣa has done the analytical breakdown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, analysis is done nice, of the study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we want your direction on how to actually do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually our, that you have already mentioned, that "Example is better than precept." Our whole process is following the example of predecessors, nothing independent. So that principle should be followed. We do not accept any precept who is free from the predecessors. Do you follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the secret of devotional service: nothing to do independent. Then it will be all right. [break] ...the particular, specific qualification of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. How they are doing? They have got so many other institutions. So what is the result? The Graduate Theological Union... So I saw so many names. What they are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Well, that's why they want us to join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we cannot join like that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Oh, no. On our own standards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We will be independent of that group. They will not dictate anything to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let him come. I shall talk with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Dr. Judah now is in a theological convention in Boston, and he'll be getting back on Tuesday. So he said he'll come down then immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Regulative principle is the groundwork foundation of everything. Academic career has nothing to do with it. [break] <span class="Italic">...bhaktasya kuto mahad guṇā.</span> Anyone who is not factual devotee, his good qualification, academic qualification, has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Many of the students at the Graduate Theological Union, they might want to come to our college to take just one or two courses. Would it be all right for them to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone is welcome. But they must see what is our ideal. Then one day they will also come. So our ideal should be always there, not that we make some compromise. Then it will not be effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> In the catalogue we say that to get a degree one must be following the regulative principles, that that is as much an important requirement as the study, academic study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is very important thing. Otherwise, just like in India, there are caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> but they have no ideal, and therefore it is not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Two <span class="Italic">āratiks</span> a day, sixteen rounds-these would be also course requirements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> In the study of theology, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is a section called phenomenology, and phenomenology means the study of the actual practices. So actually, they already have this, but they don't actually practice themselves in their schools. But in our schools we would demand practice. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...could also learn what is Deity worship, how it should be performed. They'd have to learn about chanting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> business is <span class="Italic">paṭhan pāṭhan yajan yājan danaḥ pratigrahaḥ. Brāhmaṇa</span> means he is learned himself. He is a very erudite scholar. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> first qualification. And he makes others also scholars, not that he remains himself a scholar. This is called <span class="Italic">paṭhan pāṭhan.</span> Then <span class="Italic">yajan yājan. Yajan</span> means he worships the Deity, and he teaches others how to worship. <span class="Italic">Danaḥ pratigrahaḥ.</span> He accepts charity from others, contribution, and he gives it to others. That we have mentioned, I think. What he gets in the day, he gives in the night. So these are six principles to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Otherwise, if he gets the degree and he smokes, he does not follow, he does not act... Because <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa said, "The four divisions are according to quality and work." Whether he is qualified, that will be proved by his work, not that he has taken the degree, and now he is smoking. That is going on. Academic means this. They get the degrees and after that they do all nonsense. That is academic. But this Vedic culture is not like that. He must act. Then it will be all right. [break] ...the western culture, the idea is "Never mind whatever his private character. We don't mind. He has passed Ph.D, so let him become teacher." This is western culture. "By privately, he may be rascal. It doesn't matter." That is not <span class="Italic">brahminical</span> culture. There is no "private" or "public." <span class="Italic">Antar bahiḥ. Antar</span> means internally, and <span class="Italic">bahiḥ</span> means external. We... That chant, that <span class="Italic">ācamana mantra?</span></div>
<div class="Verse">apavitraḥ pavitro vā<br class="calibre2"/>sarvāvasthaṁ gato 'pi vā<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa bahyābhyāntara-śuciḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Bahya</span> means external, and <span class="Italic">abhyāntara</span> means internal, not duplicity. That <span class="Italic">bahya,</span> externally something, and internally something, that will not be successful. <span class="Italic">Bahyābhyāntaraṁ śuciḥ. Śuciḥ</span> means purified, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And who is not purified, he is <span class="Italic">muciḥ.</span> [break] We have to present an ideal institution, not that we make compromise with everybody. That is not our business. We don't want stars. We want moon. What is the use of millions of stars? Get one moon. That is sufficient. [break] ...not expect everyone to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is not possible. Because the three qualities are working, you cannot make all the population on the modes of goodness. That is not possible. There must be people in passion and ignorance. Otherwise, why Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ,</span> four division? He could have done one kind of men. But all of them can be utilized in Kṛṣṇa consciousness if they are guided properly. <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> One can get perfection, even becoming a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> provided he is properly guided, not that only the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> can become Kṛṣṇa conscious. No. The <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> also can become, provided he is guided by the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> [break] At the present moment the whole human society is full of <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> So you have to train real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> [break] ...how respectfully received that Sudāmā Vipra, not that because he was a caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. He was so respectful to the brahminical culture. Many places it is described. Therefore His another name is <span class="Italic">namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca, jagad-hitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya.</span> In the Kali-yuga the so-called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> means having a two cents thread. Not that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> <span class="Italic">Vipratve sūtram eva ca.</span> "To become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> just have a thread, sacred thread, and then do all nonsense." That kind of is not required. That is Kali-yuga <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa:</span> "I have got the sacred thread. I have become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Now I can do all nonsense. Never mind." That will not help. [break] ...giving sacred thread on the <span class="Italic">Pāñcarātriki-vidhi,</span> the same principle. There is a little spot, fire. Fan it. The process of fanning. But the fanning is stopped; then small spot of fire also extinguished. It will have no effect because the small fire cannot do anything. It must be blazing fire. So our this process... We are accepting from the most fallen condition. Because he has little spark of fire-he wants to get Kṛṣṇa consciousness-so our process is: "Fan it." And then it must be blazing fire. But if you say that "Now that small fire is sufficient," that will not act. It must be blazing fire. A small fire is the potency. But potency should be brought to... Just like wood. There is fire. Everyone knows. But that will not serve your purpose. Fuel wood, unless there is fire... So there is fire, but it has to be increased. The wood... First of all set fire. Then there will be smoke. The smoke is also not fire. Smoke is another condition, symptom of fire, but smoke is not fire. The smoke must come into blazing fire. Then it can act.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The fanning, that is the devotional practices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> If that stops...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That verse is from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That verse about how wood is better than raw earth and fire is better than wood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Fire is better than smoke. Smoke is better than wood. Wood means <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa.</span> And smoke means <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa,</span> "Now it is coming." And fire means <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> So you have to go still above. That is called <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva-guṇa.</span> Here, simply blazing fire, it may also extinguish, but the platform where it is never extinguished, that is spiritual platform. That is spiritual. That is not material. Not only fire, but ever-blazing fire. That is spiritual platform. You cannot stop even, "Oh, here is now fire." It must be ever-blazing fire. Then it will act. But that is said when there is no chance of extinction. <span class="Italic">Nitya-yukta upāsate.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā, nitya-yukta,</span> ever-existing, eternal. That is wanted. Sometimes our devotees fall down because he has not come to that platform, ever-existing. Therefore the fire extinguished. That is possible, but everyone should be very, very careful that the fire may not be extinguished. Then again <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> There are two things: Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> If Kṛṣṇa fire is extinguished, then <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> ignorance, darkness. Two things.</div>
<div class="Verse">kṛṣṇa-bhuliyā-jīva bhoga-vāñchā kare<br class="calibre2"/>pāśate māyāra tare jāpaṭiyā dhare</div>
<div class="After-Verse">As soon as you forget Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is there, "Yes, please come here." Finished. There is no two, er, three. <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> Kṛṣṇa. If you are not in Kṛṣṇa, then you are in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And if you are in Kṛṣṇa, there is no <span class="Italic">māyā.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I hope so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) That's all right. So we have to set such institution that <span class="Italic">māyāra nāhi adhikāra,</span> no more jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We must keep very high standards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is also, vegetable.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Oh yes, Swamiji. Listening, part of the conversation I heard. [break] ...these college courses and units, and I realize that to teach a religious course which is a Vedic culture first needs devotion, second needs knowledge. And I need both of them. I lack both of them. And this is... But still, I can support this kind of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was explaining. Because you have a little desire to know, so that we have to take, a small fire, and we have to fan it. Then it will come, blazing fire. Kali-yuga means actually there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but whenever there is a little tendency of becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> we take it, accept. Otherwise there is no question of pushing on this movement. Wherever there is little chance, we take advantage. That is our process. [break] Initiation means just to see, "Here is a little chance. He is coming forward. Take it, accept him, and fan it." This is initiation, not that "Now I am initiated, I become perfect." [break] Theological Union, when it was started.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They haven't produced any pure devotees. Actually, Dr. Judah says that we will add a lot of life to that union because all these other groups are dried up.</div>

The father is the spiritual master, and the mother is Vedic knowledge. First birth is ordinary father and mother. That even cats and dogs gets. Everyone gets father and mother. Without father and mother, there is no question of birth. That <span class="Italic">janma</span> is <span class="Italic">śūdra janma.</span> Then, when he gets second birth by the spiritual father, then he becomes a <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> twice-born.

The lion is a big animal, and he is afraid of by the small animals, jackals, cats and dogs. So out of fear, they are giving vote. But giving vote to whom? To an animal. So how they can be happy? A small animal is giving vote to the big animal. But suppose a big animal, a lion, he is very powerful. Does it mean he is human being? He is animal. So the small animals may be afraid of that big animal, but the human being knows that he is animal. That's all. He doesn't care for this animal. The animal may be very strong, but that does not mean he will be given any credit of human being. No. That is not possible. So in this animal civilization there are many strong, big animals. So they are voted by the small animals, but we are not going to vote that he is very important figure. No. We immediately reject. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> "One who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is useless." That's all. We are not going to echo the small animals. That is not possible. We reject, "Oh, he is animal." That's all. So our test is whether one is Kṛṣṇa conscious. You can say that "If you are not a big animal, that does not mean that you are a big man." That is... We admit. But we have got our Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, "Here is a rascal." And so we say, "Here is a rascal." That's all. On the strength of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Anyone who does not submit to Kṛṣṇa, he is useless, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ, mūḍhaḥ, narādhamāḥ.</span> So why we shall give respect to the <span class="Italic">narādhamas, duṣkṛtinas, mūḍhās, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā?</span> We shall not give any. We shall respect only Kṛṣṇa conscious person.</div>
<div class="Verse">vaiṣṇava ṭhākura, tomāra kukura<br class="calibre2"/>bhūliya janaha more</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ṭhākura,</span> you just accept me as your dog," Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings. That is success wanted. "If you accept me as your dog, that is my success."</div>
<div class="Verse">vaiṣṇava thakura, tomāra kukura<br class="calibre2"/>bhūliya janaha more</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Our endeavor is just to become a dog of a Vaiṣṇava, not to become an animal like lion. We remain a dog, but of a Vaiṣṇava. And we refuse to become a big animal like lion. This is our philosophy. Another song is Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's, <span class="Italic">janmaobi jadi icchā to hara, kīṭa-janma hau jaha das bhakta tuṅhara:</span> "I do not know what is my next life. That depends on Your consideration. But if you think that I must take another birth or another many births, it doesn't matter. Only I request You that You make me an insignificant ant in the house of a devotee." <span class="Italic">Kīṭa-janma hau jaha das tuṅhara.</span> This is Vaiṣṇava aspiration, that If become an ant under the protection of a Vaiṣṇava, that is also successful. And I don't want to become a Brahmā who is not a devotee." So this Vaiṣṇava philosophy is very accurate. Therefore this life of a Vaiṣṇava begins with surrender, not the challenge. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Vaiṣṇava. Christ also said that "Kingdom of God is for the humble and meek." Is it not? He never said it is for the lion and elephant. The material disease means we have challenged Kṛṣṇa, God, "Oh, what is God? We can live independently." And that is material scientist. They are trying to prove, "There is no God. We can create everything in the laboratory." And that is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Yeah, there are many, many atheist. I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their whole propaganda is atheism. Therefore we are not very favorably disposed, the so-called scientists. Their whole propaganda is how to prove there is no God. That is their only aim. I mean, people say that: Oh, now nobody is going to talk of God. Talk of science." They say like that. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Dr. Radhakrishnan said, "Religion won't be accepted unless it can be accepted in terms of science."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, religion is not science? We are following blindly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No, we have our own science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No own science. This is science. They are following blindly, nonsense, the Radhakrishnan and company. We are following... Therefore our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara has said, "Kṛṣṇa, the greatest scientist." We are following the greatest scientist. They are rascals. They are following the false scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They have never seen the atom, but they believe in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atom, atom not question of seeing. You can count all the atoms throughout the universe; still, you cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. You may be so great scientist that you can count each and every atom within the universe, but still, you shall remain unable to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Now here is sand. You can say, "There are so many sands." And this is only a small beach, but you can say how many sands and atoms are there within the universe. You can become so qualified. But still, you are unqualified to understand Kṛṣṇa. Radhakrishnan, Dr. Radhakrishnan was a good man, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but he was victimized by the western culture. He got some money from Oxford University. Therefore he took the westerner-his father mother, that's all. That is his qualification. Whatever the westerners say, they will say, he will say, "Yes, this is science." Not only Dr. Radhakrishnan, all the big men of India, they thought like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Tagore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Tagore also got his position because he got the Nobel Prize from western world. Therefore he was so much obliged. All the big, big men, governors, etcetera, he would invite at his home. He was rich man, <span class="Italic">zamindar.</span> Not very rich but a descendant of rich. [break] ...became so enamored by the western people that there is a song, <span class="Italic">yo kūṭeko baralad galikiya uska tengri laya uṣka</span> mutton chop <span class="Italic">bānāiya:</span> "A dog, because he is killed by the governor, so we have made mutton chop out of it. Take it." (laughter) The dog became so exalted because he was killed by the viceroy." This is their philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Rabindranath Tagore and all these big people, they were not pure devotees, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're big lions, that's all. And they are praised by the small cats and dogs. (laughter) [break] ...Rabindranath Tagore's <span class="Italic">Gitanjali</span> he indirectly praises, "I love you," but he does not mention whom he loves. He does not know who is the lovable object. You have read his <span class="Italic">Gitanjali?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Is it not like...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Well, I respect him as a person or whatever, but he is not a devotee, and it is a rare occasion to hear a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But our principle is who is not a devotee, he is not respectable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He says in that Gitanjali that the most beautiful creation of God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That's <span class="Italic">tumi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is this? Everyone is seeing the beautiful, the most perfect creation of God, is a woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> That's lust or maybe passion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. So what is the difference between man and dog? The dog is also seeing another she-dog-the most beautiful creation of God. The ass is also seeing the she-ass-most beautiful creation. So what is the difference between ass and dog and this? And a devotee says,</div>
<div class="Verse">yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor<br class="calibre2"/>nava-nava-(rasa-)dhaman(y udyataṁ) <span class="Italic">rantum āsīt<br class="calibre2"/>tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame (smaryamāne)<br class="calibre2"/>bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanam</span> <span class="Italic">(ca)</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So long I have become devotee, since then, as soon as I think of sex, I spite on it." This is devotee. [break] ...whole world is going on simply by this perverted vision: the woman is very beautiful for the man and the man is very beautiful to the woman. This is the knot, <span class="Italic">hṛdaya-granthi.</span> Otherwise how they will work? Reciprocally, they are seeing beautiful. Sometimes the women like big, big beard. Yes, they like. And they keep. The Mohammedans, they say, "We keep beard. Women like it." They don't want this shaven headed. Huh? What is your experience? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Well, there is a lot more emphasis over here about sex and girls than it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere. Why do you say here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> In India... I come from a village, and they don't talk... Well, fathers, parents, elder brother, and priest... And it is very different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that does not mean the thought of woman is absent. They may be more civilized. They don't talk loosely. But that does not mean he is free from the woman's beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Yeah, they have it, but it is not that rampant. It is kind of suppressed a little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, they know. They are taught by the culture, "This is not good." But here they do not know that, that the thinking of woman is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think if you don't think of a woman, then that is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You're abnormal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> That's right. They think you are abnormal. That's right. Over there something like divorce and the crisis, one woman marrying ten husband or going around..., those kind of... I don't anybody in India who has been divorced. I don't know personally. So it's different level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, amongst the mass of people in India, still there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not vanished. Because by culture, by taking birth in India that is inherent. India is so great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> The one problem over there: it's very hard to find a pure devotee or real...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because their leaders have gone dead. The leaders are Jawaharlal Nehru and company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> They have destroyed. The Nehru family has destroyed India. He was atheist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even Gandhi, even Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Gandhi believed in God, but Nehru didn't believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he does not know that Kṛṣṇa is God. Everyone believes in God. That is another thing, but one must know who is God. That is advancement. Here also, the people say, "God, God is great." But as soon God comes, "Here I have come," they don't believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> These people are good <span class="Italic">chors,</span> and actually they can steal something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even Dr. Radhakrishnan he did not believe Kṛṣṇa. So this is the disease. God comes personally and says, "Here I am." They won't believe. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> Really, it is some kind of sanctifying to a person to come in contact with a real <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> In India I run into hundreds of <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> and I donate some money, but completely...
