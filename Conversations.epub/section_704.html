<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa (in car):</span> People have to be great fools not to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grateful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Therefore we say, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> That is the state, symptom. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as you see that one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Judgment is already there. [break] ...this lump, (laughter) lump of matter. It is our mental concoction that "This lump is bad; this lump is good." The whole thing is lump. There is no such discrimination, "this lump" or "that lump." [break] ...being a lover of God, nobody can smile, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Without being a lover of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtāḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Who can become a... Smiling means he is satisfied in every respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa is always smiling, isn't He?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Smeran bhangi-traya-paricitam.</span> Kṛṣṇa is always smiling and standing in curved position. That is jubilant. Why so near?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because the car makes so much noise that if I don't they'll never hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Smeran bhangi-traya-paricitam saci-drstir na drstim.</span> [break] ...shows that people are prosperous. They are not cheap buildings like America. [break] ...termite, always attacked by termite. They have no taste for good building. [break] And fuming? Fuming process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fumigation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, fumigation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> When the termites get into the wood they eat up the wood and they hide in nests underneath the house. So the way that they try to kill the termites is by gassing them. They cover their house with a tent, and then they gas, and it goes into the nests and kills all the termites. They are perfecting this art of killing. You said that in Calcutta in a very expensive cloth shop... Your father's brother used to have cloth shop?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That when there was rats and they would eat the cloth that he would simply put some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in the room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the rats would come and take. They wouldn't eat the cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like a man also. If he gets food, shelter, then he doesn't commit any criminal act. Man is also dangerous. Even if you give him food, shelter, he will do mischievous activities. That is man. But an animal will not do it. You can tame even a tiger by giving him food. He will never... If he sees that you are giving him food he'll never attack, the tiger also, feeling obliged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's <span class="Italic">duracara</span>? <span class="Italic">Duracara</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ferocious, but still, when he is given food by somebody, he feels obliged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> On one lecture tape you said that man is <span class="Italic">duracara,</span> very difficult to... When he's misbehaved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] (out of car) ...by chanting <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and herb. But a crooked man cannot be controlled any way. Therefore he is more dangerous than the snake. <span class="Italic">Sarpat krurataraḥ khalaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why is it that the man cannot be tamed and the unintelligent animal can be tamed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because man is more intelligent. He can misuse his independence and intelligence, whereas animal cannot do that. He is not so intelligent. He has... That is the defect of the modern civilization. They have been described as <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina. Duṣkṛtina</span> means he has got brain more intelligent than the animal, but the brain is being utilized for mischievous activities. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> Brain should be utilized for some benevolent work for the good of the living entities. But this brain, modern educated brain, is being misused for discovering something which is very dangerous to the human society. Therefore <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> And he is getting Nobel Prize because he has discovered this atomic weapon which is so dangerous, and he is glorified, "Oh, you have done so nice scientific discovery." What is that discovery? "That you can kill... Instead of one man with gun, you can kill one thousand men. Therefore you must be offered Nobel Prize." This is man's appreciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Better to walk this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> all rascals. <span class="Italic">Na mā duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ.</span> How you can understand that this man is mischievously meritorious? How you can understand? <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina</span> means mischievously meritorious. This man is meritorious, but he is using his merit for mischievous activities. That is called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> So how you can understand this man is mischievously meritorious? You can say, "How is that? A man is meritorious and at the same time he is mischievous?" There're so many organization, especially in Western country, big, big rogues' organization simply for cheating, simply for smuggling. They have got merit. Otherwise how they have organized such big, big organization? But what for? All mischievous activities, harassing government, harassing people. The merit is being used. There are many organizations in the Western country. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Many, many. All these realty business. Realty business, you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Realty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventy-five percent of them are mischievous. I have got experience. Seventy-five percent, they are simply mischievously planning-you have got five thousand or ten thousand dollar-to take it away, showing you that you are getting 200,000 worth of property. In this way they make implication, take your ten thousand dollar, and then finished. Many cases. Their only business is this. Big, big lawyer implicated. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> Go to a lawyer; immediately you are implicated. You see, this man is condemned, Nixon, and he is to pay the lawyer's bill by working hard, by writing a book and selling the good will to some company. He has to pay the lawyer's bill. He has no money. The lawyers, doctors, as soon as they get some opportunity, immediately captures you and finish-<span class="Italic">bas.</span> How to take away all your money. Because artificially they have enhanced the standard of living, they want money. So unless they do mischievous activity, by honest means they cannot get money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that they earn money by illegal methods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why is it that in the modern day good people, they don't come into public office? Good people. In previous ages there were <span class="Italic">rājarṣis,</span> great kings, very pious kings. Why is it that only rogues are aspiring today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the democracy. You will not get vote. As soon as you become honest man in the public office, nobody will be obedient to you, and it will be impossible for him to execute any... You see? The bank manager in Delhi-he was my friend-that "I am afraid of this union. If I press them to do something, they will immediately topsy-turvy the whole management." Bank manager said. "So I am afraid of the workers' union," he told me. So therefore good men, they do not go to this political post because they know they will not be able to do anything good. He will be surrounded by all rogues. Nobody will execute his order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the future in Kali-yuga looks very bleak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very, very black. <span class="Italic">Āchinna-dāra-draviṇ gacchanti giri-kānanam.</span> People, general people, will be so much disgusted that they will be obliged to give up family and home and go to the forest, being disappointed: "Now I cannot manage. Let me go away."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's predestined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, predestined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But that can all change in a minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that can be changed only by... Therefore we are... "Go <span class="Italic">giri-kānanam,</span> but take shelter of Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Vānaṁ gato yad harim āśrayet.</span> "Go, leave your, this so-called family, home, and go to the forest and take shelter of Kṛṣṇa." That is advised by Prahlāda Mahārāja. "That is the best thing in life. If you want to be free from anxiety, give up this so-called family life. Go to the forest and take shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa." That is Prahlāda Mahārāja's advice. Don't try to adjust it. It will not be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially in Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Especially in Kali-yuga. So we are offering them shelter that "In this age you are not accustomed to go to the forest. It will be more inconvenient. Come to our center and be Kṛṣṇa conscious and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Your problems will be solved." This is our mission. Everyone is faced with problem. Otherwise why there is majority of suicide? Everyone is faced with problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's best to go this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, somebody hitting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shilling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, they are playing golf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. How persistent life is this. His main body is cut into pieces; still, he's struggling to exist. He has got some attachment-"I shall live here, stand here for ten thousand years." This is <span class="Italic">māyā. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How can a man's intelligence be rectified? If intelligence is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana,</span> chant. Somehow or other, induce them to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Everything all right. By flattering, by soliciting, by giving him <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> by elevating him, that "You are the best man in the world"-in this way inducing him, "Please chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," then he will be rectified. This is Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. There is no other way. He is ruined, and the more the Kali-yuga advances, he becomes more and more ruined. All other attempts will failure. Don't you see in your country the LSD-addicted hippies? Government spends so much money to rectify them-failure. But as soon as they come to our camp, immediately success. How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> By this chanting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the amazement. That is the amazement of Professor Judah and all others, that "How it is happening? There is something in the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is good propaganda with the governments also. This is good way to get the governments to support our movement more and more, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government never objected to our movement. Never. I never met any objection from government side. Neither even Christian priestly side. I never met any objection. They understand that "He is doing something."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only from your Godbrothers. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You don't like the sunshine so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only at the time of massage. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...Vedic statement or is it just preference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is my personal. During winter it is pleasing, of course, sunshine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...walk this way. There's a ravine here. [break] Śrīla Prabhupāda, it always seems that there is some kind of inspiration for spiritual life there. Is that simply mental concoction, or is it actually a fact, the land itself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Land. It is the influence of the land. Just like Vṛndāvana. Whatever you may be, you stay here, you become spiritualized. Simply you stay there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it possible to reform a person against their will?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not possible. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...sign, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that someone is actually having change in heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the sign that someone is actually having change in heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By his action. [break] ...kasipu tried to make Prahlāda atheist. He failed. And Prahlāda tried to make his father theist. He failed. Don't you see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So unless one agrees you cannot turn him. It is not possible. Five-years'-old boy, staunch devotee, and the powerful Hiraṇyakaśipu, father, who is threatening with his life and so many ways he tried that "You become atheist, godless. Otherwise I shall kill you." He did not agree. And similarly, the son also solicited the father that "You have got so much power by the grace of God. Why you are becoming atheist?" Both of them could not turn to their side. Prahlāda remained Prahlāda, and Hiraṇyakaśipu remained Hiraṇyakaśipu. [break] ...can expect that without agreeing, conceding, one can be reformed. No, that is not possible. Impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not simply by rubber stamp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible. He must agree, "Yes." Therefore guru is required. Guru means, accept guru means, "Whatever you say, I will accept." That is guru. Otherwise friendly talk. Friendly talk will not do. To accept guru means "Now I accept you, guru, my instructor, without any argument," and that is acceptance. "Whatever you say, I shall do." That is agreement. Then he can be reformed. <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'ha śādhi mā prapannam:</span> "I surrender unto you. I become your disciple. Now you train me." Then he can be reformed. Otherwise not possible. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When we were at school we accept a teacher and he teaches us mathematics or something like this, but when it comes to spiritual life and we accept a guru, people criticize by saying, "Oh, you're not thinking for yourself anymore."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you have surrendered. You say, "Yes, we have surrendered. That is the way." <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> The first term is "surrender," <span class="Italic">praṇipāta.</span> Otherwise it is not possible. If one does not surrender, there is no question of reformation. He must voluntarily surrender: "Yes. Whatever you say, I shall do." Then things can be advanced. Otherwise not possible. (end)</div>
