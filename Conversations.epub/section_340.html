<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> He's coming Prabhupāda. He just pulled up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayahari:</span> Prabhupāda, this morning you talked about astrology in your lecture. Is this accepted in the Vedic scripture and by the gurus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Astrology means... That is also Vedic. <span class="Italic">Jyotir-veda. Jyotir-veda.</span> That is also part of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they learn these three things: astrology and medicine. These two things. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is supposed to go to every householder's place, and he will inform, "Today is such and such <span class="Italic">tithi.</span> The such and such thing should be done." And if required, if somebody inquires about, "Now I am going to that place. What will happen? Just find out the auspicious moment," so they will give him. Still it is current. It may be wrongly done or rightly, but the system is still there. Astrologer. The king should be always accompanied by a first-class astrologer. [break] ...there is a whole street, both sides simply astrology. [break] ...good astrologers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayahari:</span> Astrology is very popular in the western world. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is our scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, how are you? Thank you very much. Come on. How are you? Feeling all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> Fine, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I brought a friend, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from Calcutta. He was my class friend in Calcutta. He is from St. Xavier's College. He graduated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> Bengali. (Bengali conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) ...Mahatma Gandhi Road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Daniel, come here. Daniel Sardar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> Sujit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sujit, oh. (Bengali conversation regarding his being a student of science, chemistry and plastics engineering, and Śrīla Prabhupāda tells him that he attended Scottish Churches' College) [break] ...astrology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> What is my opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I am asking scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> First of all I did not believe astrology in the beginning. I thought it was a pseudo science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you may think, but what is the opinion of the scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, scientists would say that there is no background.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how it so happens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because they say something which cannot be proved by experimental science, that does not work, calling science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then how do you say that life is from matter? That cannot be proved by experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is why they are going to prove it. They are trying to prove it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then again, "going to prove." They cannot prove, they'll not not admit it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> See, astrology, I think, what he said is half true. Astrology is a science but it is not an exact science like mathematics and chemistry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, No, it is mathematics. Astrology is simply based on mathematics. Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> To calculate the planetary...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. The comet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> It is from astronomy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Astronomy, yes. Astrology is part of astronomy. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> It's part of the science. It has been accepted as part of the science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Astrological science is mostly speculative theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Astronomy also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sujit:</span> They are proving a lot of things. They are calculating when a certain star can be in certain positions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, that can be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our astrology is calculated by the position of the stars. By astronomy you calculate the position of the star, and they know, "If the star is in such and such position, the result will be like this." That is astrology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This looks like collecting some facts from some experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is calculated by the astral movement. It is a great science. People do not know it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So Wolfe Prabhu was telling me that "So we don't believe in astrology, but when Śrīla Prabhupāda says, then you believe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Wolfe, he was telling me that, because I was telling him that I did not believe in astrology. Then one day Śrīla Prabhupāda was talking on astrology. Then Wolfe said, "If Śrīla Prabhupāda said, then you believe. And if it is not said by Śrīla Prabhupāda, you don't believe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We believe in astrology. But because it is a difficult science, people do not understand it properly. That is another thing. In my practical life I see. In my horoscope, everything is written, what I am doing. Everything is written. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That would be called like genius. Sometimes. If somebody can predict what is going to happen in the future, can be, just like, taken...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, these astrologers can give everyone exact, the history of life, what is going to happen, what happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But it is true, though Śrīla Prabhupāda, in our family life, when we want to do something, they always go to a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Astrologer. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And then they... [break] (end)</div>
