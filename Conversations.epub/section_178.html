<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply we shall sell retail in our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> Let them sell to the bookstore. We shall not sell a single copy to the bookstore, or wholesaler. We shall simply sell in our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party. In this way arrange...[break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...weekend festivals from town to town?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Town to town. What do you think this idea Huh? Continue engagement. And as many men may join us, we can accommodate them. Every country. <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> I got this idea, one king, (indistinct), the grandson of Prthuraya, this Mahārāja Prithu, he performed so many <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> that on the surface of the earth, there were only <span class="Italic">kuśa</span> grass scattered. <span class="Italic">Yajña,</span> they require <span class="Italic">kuśa</span> grass. <span class="Italic">Kuśa</span> grass. So all over the world it was simply scattered, after <span class="Italic">yajñas,</span> I have given my comment in this. Similarly, we shall perform this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana yajña</span> all over the world, town to town, town to town. Now we have got GBC all over the world. Let them organize. What they'll do? Organize <span class="Italic">yajña</span> after <span class="Italic">yajña, yajña</span> after <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> So that as at the present moment even if we go somewhere, are known to: "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" They say. The whole world will say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." Either jokingly or serious, it doesn't matter. Let them joke, criticize them, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," still they will have the effect. Still they will have it. In the <span class="Italic">Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa</span> there is an instance that a Mussulman was attacked by, what is called? Boar having...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Tiger? Boar. A wild boar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A wild boar. So when the boar attacked him the Musselmans, when they do not like they say, <span class="Italic">"Haram. Haram."</span> Condemn means <span class="Italic">haram.</span> So when the boar attacked him he said <span class="Italic">haram. "Haram!" </span>But it acted, <span class="Italic">ha rāma,</span> and he got salvation. Do you follow what I say? A Mussulman said, <span class="Italic">'ha ram. Ha ram</span> He condemned. It is abominable. That is the meaning of Urdu, <span class="Italic">haram.</span> But at the time of death, when the boar attacked him, he said, <span class="Italic">"Haram."</span> So it acted <span class="Italic">ha rāma. Ha, he rāma.</span> It acted, chanting the name of Rāma, Hare Rāma. He meant something else, but it acted as beneficial as chanting <span class="Italic">He rāma.</span> So therefore this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> either you chant seriously, or those who are criticizing us, jokingly, the effect will be same. So anyway let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Do you follow? Even they do not take it seriously, if they imitate, joke, still they'll be benefited .</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Should these be straight <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> no... Should these be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, they... As we install our Deity and chanting, dancing, offering <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> This interests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Not electric guitars and all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Good. Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Electric guitar, if it is, they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa only, nothing else, then it is all right. But as far as possible, simply <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> and <span class="Italic">kartāl.</span> But if GBC thinks that it attracts more people so they give contribution, that is a different thing. Otherwise there is no need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> I think nothing can attract like <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas</span> and <span class="Italic">karatālas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is practical, we have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> When we put guitars, it waters it down. It doesn't have the same effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All GBC members should organize like that. Then everything will be all right. And sell books. Now you... What is the name? Maṇḍalībhadra, he is slow. So you translate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Okay. Because there are others, they are competent. I have others, they are competent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Simply you check that they are not writing nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh yes. That I can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. And print it and distribute. And another thing. If you can print yourself, it is all right, But if you want printing cost from the general book fund, then whatever you sell you deposit there. You deposit and take, deposit and take, deposit and take. Then when, even if you have no money you'll get money. And then you deposit. But if you spend it, then you cannot expect from the general book fund.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no. I'm already doing that with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jaya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Whatever they print for me, or whatever Bali prints for me, I pay him and I pay 100% mark-up so that there can be some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in this way organize and distribute literature, and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana yajña.</span> Then our mission will be successful. <span class="Italic">Accha,</span> here, they are coming, so we shall make a committee, London building fund committee. In that committee, Mr. Arnold and his wife... [break] ...nicely and organize responsibly. So that can be done provided they have got their own men. Why he's not training the Africans? He should train.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> He hasn't got very many Africans. I think only about two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then suspend that installation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> They haven't been making any devotees there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no... [break] ...and if we conquer our eating then we can conquer our sleeping also. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra vihārakādi vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**. [break] Don't make fuss. If you are serious, then it is all right. Otherwise, you are young men. If you again give up <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> or you try to marry, it will be scandalous for our society. Don't do that. If you are steady... But so far report is you are not very steady. Do you admit this or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> Yes. Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how you can take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?</span> It is a very great responsibility. [break] There is no need of taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> If you are sincere in preaching you can do in this dress. Where is the harm? Simply by changing, taking a rod, you'll not become God immediately. You have to work, steadily. What is there in <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?</span> Do you mean to say taking a rod one becomes <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> means you must be sacrificing everything for Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>6.1]<span class="Italic">. Sa sannyāsī,</span> he's <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Anāśritaḥ karma phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti.</span> You went to Israel but again came back. Why? What was the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> Well, there's no activity there Prabhupāda. I got attacked on the street. I got very sick and I was attacked on the street when I was on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you like to go to Africa? It is warm country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> Yes Prabhupāda. That would be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can go. You can go. And you know Deity... [break] ...and if it is sufficiently left, then she doesn't require further. Otherwise add something. But she'll take after the husband. My mother was doing. Yes. The remnants of foodstuff left by the husband will be taken by the wife. That means if the husband does not eat, she'll not eat. So those things are now dream only. (laughs) Impossible. Just like small child, If he follows the father, catching the hand of the father, she is always safe, he is always safe. Now your so-called independence has spoiled the social life. You know he was married. Where she is now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> Oh, she left. We haven't seen her since she left. I don't know where she is. Three years ago. When she left, Śrīla Prabhupāda, she took some drugs and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drug is killing the whole Western nation. You will be spoiled, you will be finished with this drug habit. You are already finished. America is finished. They cannot do anything anymore. Neither industrialists nor big scholars, neither big fighter. Anything. Simply spoiled. The only shelter is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Pāpi tāpi yata chilo harināme uddharilo.</span> They can be only saved by this process. They have no other... otherwise they are going to hell. All Americans, the so-called puffed up materialist. This is a fact. So if you want to do service to your country, introduce this Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the younger generation. They will be saved. You be saved and save your brothers. And otherwise this poison, this intoxication, heroin, cocaine, and LSD and this and marijuana, finished everything. But if you become steady in one life without deviating for <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then you make solution of all problems. That is the duty of human being . Instead of suffering this repeated birth and death, one life sacrifice. What is that sacrifice? What is inconvenience to live nicely, avoiding these four rascal habit, taking Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and reading all these nice books. Where is the difficulty? Nice life. First class life. Wherever you will go you will be respectable. Anyone will worship you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Materialistic life is so bothersome. All the time some trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in hog civilization. That's all. They are thinking that "We are very happy eating stool." But others know that what kind of happiness he is enjoying. Similarly these rascal <span class="Italic">karmis,</span> materialists, they are thinking by... What is called? Kini...What is called? Naked skirt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Miniskirt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Miniskirt, trying to show the private part and people will be attracted and she will be happy. This is regular prostitution. Regular prostitution. Still they are not getting husband. Even they walk naked... That will come. Say after fifty years it will come like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span>They are starting already some places, walking naked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the law is you cannot marry more than one wife. The rascal lawgiver. So many women, there must be... One husband, at the present moment, must marry at least one dozen wives, otherwise they're going to hell. At least, she will know that "I have got a husband." Maybe the husband of twelve wives, but they are anxious to have a husband. That facility should be given to them. They are anxious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> But they don't want to have any children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is next program. Why not? Now we are having our wives, so many children. Los Angeles full of children. So natural way should be accepted. They require husband. The law is, "No. You cannot have more, you cannot marry one wife." The girls have become prostitute. That's all right. "The girls are becoming prostitute. That's all right. But you cannot marry more than one." What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They have contraceptive pills even for young children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> One barrister, one of the top judges in England, a top man, top doctor, he said children should have sex life at fourteen. He said this in the newspaper two days ago. He said children at fourteen should be allowed to have sex life. He said this should be made legal. He's a top doctor or judge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Children should be allowed to have sex life at fourteen years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is psychological. They develop... Sex life, sex urge is there as soon as twelve years, thirteen years old, especially women. So therefore early marriage was sanctioned in India. Early marriage. Boy fifteen years, sixteen years, and girl twelve years. Not twelve years, ten years. I was married, my wife was eleven years. I was 22 years. She did not know what is sex, eleven years' girl. Because Indian girls, they have no such opportunity of mixing with others. But after the first menstruation, the husband is ready. This is the system, Indian system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So they are not spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. And the psychology is the girl, after first menstruation, she enjoys sex life with a boy, she will never forget that boy. Her love for that boy is fixed up for good. This is woman's psychology. And she is allowed to have many, oh, she will never be chaste woman. These are the psychology. So these rascals, Westerners, they do not know and they are becoming philosopher, scientist, and politician, and spoiling the whole world. They can be saved only by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. There is no other way. Otherwise they will lick up their skyscraper building and everything will go to hell. We have seen in New York, so many houses fall down. In New York. Yes. So many. Simply garbage. I have studied. Simply full of garbage. Nobody is going to take care. And the boys and girls loitering in the street as hippies. This is a very, very, bad sign. You see? No home, home neglected, no regular life. The whole nation will be spoiled. It is already spoiled. The poison is already there. Fire. Now it is increasing. Just like you set fire, it increases. So that fire is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And the Russians and the Chinese, they are training to take over. They are marching, practicing war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In Russia we noticed every day they're practicing for war, young people, marching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mechanical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. In China too, marching, ready to take over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> When we were in New York, one boy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there will be fight. That is the prediction of great politician. There will be war between these Communist and anti-Communist. There are two parties now. The anti-Communist will be defeated. The Communists will come out victorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We don't want to fight. None of our boys want to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They also do not want fight but they are forced. They do not want to fight. Because they're... <span class="Italic">Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> In the Kali-yuga everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> What he'll fight? Fighting is not the business of a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> It is meant for the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> And nobody is being trained as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Everyone is being trained as <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or utmost <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> how to make money. That's all. One class of men is being trained how to serve and get some money, another class is being trained how to make money by exploitation. That is capitalist and communist. The communists are the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> They are protesting that "You are exploiting us and getting money. It must stop." That is Communism. Is it not? And the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they are trying to exploit others. Some way or other bring money. So there are these capitalists and <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Therefore the whole social structure is lost. So we are trying to create some <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> And people if follow our instruction then whole social structure is again revived. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So we have got very serious mission. Don't be fickle. When you have come and sacrificed your life for the mission, don't be fickle. Be very steady and capture Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet tightly. You'll never be attacked by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Otherwise as soon as you give up Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is ready. Just like side by side there is sun... shadow and light. If you push little from light then go to shadow. This is already side by side <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and Kṛṣṇa. So as soon as you forget Kṛṣṇa-<span class="Italic">māyā.</span> As soon as you give up <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then Kṛṣṇa. (pause) So Pradyumna is transcribing everyday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. He doesn't work here. He works over at the library, British Museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Just down the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He takes them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I don't know. I guess he does. He's gone all day. Every day he's gone. He says it's too disturbing to work here, too crowded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think he's doing it by longhand, writing it out because he doesn't take a typewriter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make arrangement, whatever thoughts are coming I am giving you. <span class="Italic">Ārati</span> is finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In about two or three minutes. Five. You'll hear a conchshell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere this class must be there, morning evening class. Either it is festival or temple. If you go on simply festival, you don't require to start many centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Starting more centers is not necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We have the big cities covered. If people want to go and join us they can go to the big city and join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because opening center means so much responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So much. Land...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So better open. Deity will be there. Just like Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja is doing. Install the deity for one week. You know everything. You have done in Calcutta, Bombay and other. Same thing. You were in Allahabad also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, I was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Allahabad, Gorakhpur. So same thing. And for persons spiritually inclined, for them this traveling is very good. Traveling means with this occupation. It is very good. You'll be more popular and there will be no difficulty, mind will be steady.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It takes away our attachment for everything materially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Gosvāmīs, they did not stay underneath a tree for more than one night. So you decide; then you do the needful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> When should we arrange for Śivānanda's fire ceremony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We should have initiation too, first initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Do it all the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. So we'll consult Pradyumna and find a good time, calendar, on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any day. (end)</div>
