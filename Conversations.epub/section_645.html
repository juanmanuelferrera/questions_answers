<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (sound of bird chirping) ...take the fruits and singing morning. They are happier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When we tell people that they may take their next birth as an animal, they say that is all right because the animals are happier than the humans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But because you are rascal, you do not know, you can become more happier, go back to home, back to Godhead. That you do not know. (Sounds of birds singing) Just see how. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the bird that was singing. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...there? A small bird!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's one expression in Anerica, "Free as a bird." People think that the birds are more free than they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Also "The birds and the bees." Culminate (?) in sex life. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Balboa Park. He was a Spanish explorer. He's supposed to be the first one to see the Pacific Ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He was the first white man to discover California, I think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yeah. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First man to see the Pacific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Only four hundred years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> First white man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> The Indians were there, of course. The Red Indians were already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> In California.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone was there, but they do not know. (chuckles) The Pacific and Atlantic Ocean is mentioned in Kalidāsa Kavi's book, <span class="Italic">Kumāra-sambhava. Toya-nidhim avagahya sthitaḥ pṛthivyām iva māna-daṇḍaḥ.</span> They are all mentioned, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean. These fools do not know anything. And they say, therefore, "First man to come," as if before him there was no man. Just see. "There was no man. There was no civilization," these rascals' version. What is that bridge? Is that bridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's a bridge that goes to one island. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...explain; therefore they bring this theory of chance. But we don't find any such chance in practical life. "There was a fool and he became high-court judge." Is there any? "There was a fool. He became a high-court judge." Is there any evidence like that? "There was ape. It became human, human being." I am simply surprised how this kind of argument is accepted by other fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And if you don't accept it, then they fail you in the examination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If you don't accept and repeat it, then you become failed in the examination. Then you can't get a diploma. Then you cannot get a good job. So they force you to repeat it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Field. All of a sudden it became by chance a garden and beautiful, everything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> El Cid Conquedor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He was a famous Spanish soldier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He fought the Muslims when they invaded Spain. He is a famous Spanish man who fought against the Muslims when they invaded. From Africa, they crossed over the sea and invaded Spain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Moors. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This has got some meaning. What is this matchbox? There is earth, there is sands (sense?), there is comfort. So we shall go this way or...? [break] It is all vacant? [break] Big demonstration of cow fighting, bull fighting, and kill them. Such a Christian is trying to convert others as Christians! Just see the fun. Christ said, "Thou shall not kill," and they are sporting with the life of bull, and they are Christian. We have to believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Isn't that somewhat in the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> spirit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonsense spirit. Rascal spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> But sometimes those people get killed when they're fighting the bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But your arrangement is to kill the bull. By chance or by God's desire you become killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's a very popular sport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they are Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I think before the bullfighter goes to the ring, he first goes to the church and prays for blessings that he will be able to do very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And everyone gets drunk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They also have those cock fights, you know, those chicken fights. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...begin war with their own children. This is also war. The child wants to come out, and they are fighting, advanced. (end)</div>
