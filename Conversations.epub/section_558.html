<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixteen hundred thousand. And what is their calculation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> 250,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Miles from the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 459,000?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> 250,000 miles from the earth. They say it is very near the earth and that the sun is very far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...circumstances, it is now doubtful whether they are going to the moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In the newspaper yesterday there was an article about New York City. The city government is going bankrupt because they... They have asked the President for 1,500 million dollars in emergency aid. Because of crime and dirtiness and noise, all the rich people are leaving New York, and they can't get any taxes from the poor people. So they don't have money to pay to run the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have seen. New York is very dilapidated, many quarters. And especially Second Avenue, those are very dirty. The... On the Fifth Avenue, that Central Park is also very dirty. This civilization will collapse. It cannot be run on. Fourth-class men, I tell. Because it is conducted by the fourth-class men. Ask that gentleman why they are asking. Are they not fourth-class men? They could not manage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That man last night admitted. He said, "Now I must leave and do my fourth-class activities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is fourth class. This is the proof. Fourth-class men administering... Just like misadministration not immediately detected. After some time, when the case is unmanageable, it is detected. Therefore fourth-class men. Simply these Western people, they know how to earn money by hook and crook. So, so long the money is there it is covered, the fourth-class men. And when the money is finished, they are exposed, fourth-class men. They're simply covered by money. No social structure, no spiritual understanding, no character, nothing of the sort. Still India, so fallen, you... 95% people, living, husband and wife, very peacefully. And in the Western countries after six months' marriage, divorce. Are they not fourth class? Even the husband and wife cannot continue peaceful life, what to speak of others. Now this rascal Jawaharlal Nehru has introduced divorce in the Hindu society. Otherwise in the Hindu society separation between husband and wife is not even dreamt of. That, it cannot be. However there may be quarrelsome, but there is no question of separation. Husband and wife, they fight, everywhere. I have seen. My father and mother was fighting. I fought. (laughter) But there is no question of separation. Separation, they never think. Neither the husband can think of, nor the wife can think of. Even in the life of Gandhi there was fight between husband and wife, and the Gandhi one day drove his wife, "Get out from my home." So she was put into the street, and she began to cry, "Where shall I go?" And then Gandhi ans..., "Come on." Yes. And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, <span class="Italic">bambhārambhe laghu-kriyā.</span> The husband and wife may fight. It becomes a very serious thing, but don't take of it as serious. This is Hindu philosophy. Husband and wife quarrel should not be taken as very serious. They fight and again they live peacefully. Why this divorce? The divorce mean it kills the whole family life. The children goes away; the father goes away; the mother goes away. I have seen so many cases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Just like that girl who came two days ago, that Indian girl. Her parents were separated. Now she is living thousands of miles away with some boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are this part of Indian, the Fiji Indians. They have learned the art of divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They are very Western, westernized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, how can the position be reconciled if in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one of the two, the husband or the wife, wants to enjoy sense gratification, but the other does not? Should there be separation then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... They should be trained up. Sense enjoyment means not advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As soon as one is advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his sense enjoyment spirit will be reduced. That is the test. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> The test is, how you are advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the proportionate diminishing of sense enjoyment. That is the test. Just like cure of the disease means diminishing the fever, temperature. This is the test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What if that fever is not being diminished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he should try to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> instead of sixteen rounds, sixty-four rounds. That is the way. Sixteen round is the minimum. Otherwise Haridāsa Ṭhākura was 300,000. So you have to increase. That is the only remedy. If one has got determination, he will make progress without any trouble. That determination is very difficult, that determination, "I must be Kṛṣṇa conscious fully." That determination. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> So they have asked to the central government, federal government, help?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In New York? Yes, they asked from the President, President Ford.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is federal government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Federal government, yes. And President Ford said no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, he said no. He said, "If I give New York money then every city will come for money..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> "...when they have some trouble." He said, "You made the trouble. Now you work it out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's good answer. "You fourth-class man, you have created the situation. Now you save the situation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They used to borrow money from the banks every year, the city government of New York. They used to borrow money from the banks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bank has refused?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, they won't loan any more money because they know the tax money won't come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see the position. The bank is refusing loan to the municipal corporation, city corporation. They have no credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> So that means the city will increase their taxes on the public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if the public is moving from the city, where is the source of taxation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's the big problem. All the rich people are leaving because they're getting so much tax and so many other problems. And big business also is leaving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where they are leaving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just to the suburbs, outside the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Also they move their headquarters to other cities, newer cities. Just like in Dallas, that area. Atlanta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This artificial way of life will lead to such disasters. It is a most artificial way of life. It is not natural way. This bus goes this way-I see every day vacant, no passenger. And still, they have to run as scheduled. They cannot stop it. That means so much wastage. Not only bus, I have seen aeroplane. From Nairobi to London, you have seen? We were five passengers or four passengers. No passengers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Four or three, maybe three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have seen? Yes. Such a big plane, consuming so much petrol, vacant passenger. No except ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Many times we have had that experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That is what is happening with these big planes. They're building these big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> 747's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Can't remember the name. You mean the supersonic ones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yeah, the big jets, and no one can... There's not enough people to fly in them. Therefore they have to finish them. They have to scrap their big jets. They're not of any use because there's not enough people to fly. They're coming to the end of their technological research. Also in the cars they cannot... There's one car, the Volkswagen. They cannot refine the body any more, so now they're simply making the same car each year without any change in the design, because they've reached the perfection of their design and they're not making any more advancement. They're coming to a halt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they will come to a halt to their sex desire? They have designed so many ways sex desire. The... Who was telling me that some beach, all naked women are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, yes. In Australia also. They reserve a certain beach for naked bathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is also sex desire. When it will come to end? Most artificial civilization. And the man who came, he is meant for solving the problems, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. Usually those type of persons, they just study the problems, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the study? Anyone can study. Just like we are giving: "It is a most artificial civilization."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He's drawing a big salary for studying. He's getting a big research salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> And he's teaching others how to study the problems, but there's no solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They have no solution actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The solution is there. They won't take it. Solution is there, that everyone produce your own food. There is so much land; utilize it. The solution is there. No. They want to sit down on the table, chair, in a very nice compartment, and making solution. They won't go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He was saying that your solution was too simple. He said that people will not accept it because it is too simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his ignorance. They will say it is primitive. That is the only solution. According to the Vedic system, you cannot use anything which you cannot produce. Suppose this we are using, but according the Vedic system we should not use it because I cannot produce it. Then the whole solution is there. Nobody will manufacture this because there will be no customer. If I refuse this use of this machine, thinking that "I cannot produce it; I should not use it," then where is the customer? The so-called industry will automatically stop, and he has to go to the village outlying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Some of the orthodox hippies have this philosophy, and they reject all machines and things that they cannot make themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural. That is natural. It is good. But they are not led by good leader. Otherwise next alternative is this, that you have to give up this artificial way of civilization. Now this land is vacant. We can produce so much food grains if it is utilized. Fruits, flower, vegetables, grains-we can produce. This land is very good land for producing potato, watermelon, this. Very good land. But who is doing that? This is the suitable land for producing watermelon. And watermelon is such a nice thing, and potato. You boil potato and take watermelon, you have full nourishment are supplied. Very innocent and simple food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In one science magazine they have published recently there's an article by a man who says we must eat meat because the plants don't have any fatty tissues for making brain tissue, so they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal. So your brain is causing disaster; still you are developing brain? (laughter) Your brain is causing bankruptcy, and still you want to develop this rubbish brain? Begging money, "You give us money so that we can maintain"? And what is the use of this brain? Burn this brain. Advise him that "You better burn your brain so that you may not create any more disaster." To keep his brain, one animal must be sacrificed. And the brain work is this, that they are creating disaster. What is the use of this brain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says that the brain of man is bigger because man has been eating meat for so long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another rascal. That is the difficulty. The world is full of rascals and demons. And they are leaders. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> "A blind man is leading other blind men."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Instead of using the land to grow potatoes and watermelons, they're simply using it to build more offices for tables and chairs to study the situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. (pause) Life will be more more dangerous in this Kali-yuga. People will starve. And they... It is already began. The hippies are going to the forest. This will be the whole world situation. Everything will be chaotic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But if they actually go to the forest, then that will be one step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is disappointment. It is simply disappoint... That is not solution. But people will do that. When the one is mad he doesn't know what to do-"Let me go to the forest." <span class="Italic">Achinna dāra-draviṇaṁ gacchanti giri-kānanam,</span> it is said. <span class="Italic">Giri</span> means mountain, and <span class="Italic">kānanam</span> means forest. Giving up their hearth and home... They are already giving up the home, wife, children, and going away. Everybody doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Actually, in so many cases the hippies, they went to the forest, and because there was no standard of spiritual life there, they became discouraged also. They ran into the same problems in the forest that they had in the cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So therefore many of these communities that they started back in, about ten years ago, 1960's, they have all folded up because there was nothing to hold them together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no engagement. Therefore we are proposing that eat nicely, live nicely, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the engagement. But they have no such engagement. How they will live? <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> Every living entity wants some pleasure, but this pleasure is finished. Therefore <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Now they seek... Let them seek out pleasure from Brahmān. So that they do not know. Now the situation is then no monies. Then they will tax. Those who are living, they will be disturbed by taxation. They have no other means. <span class="Italic">Kara-piditaḥ. Kara</span> means tax, and <span class="Italic">pidita</span> means disturbed. They will be like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> And they will also be forced out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Such a huge city, if there is no money, they will tax those who are living there more and more. That is the only alternative. If you want actually peaceful life, then produce your own necessities of life and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and read these books. This is the only solution. There is no other solution. What is the use of running fifty miles by car to go to one's office and sit down in the office and make plan how to exploit others? This way? This is the business:" Make some plan, bluff people, advertisement, and money will come." This is their business. They are not giving anything, simply bluffing. Just like crossword. They are engaged in making solution. You know that, crossword?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The crossword? You mean the puzzle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the whole day they are making solution. This is their means of earning money. I have seen it. (pause) (chuckles) He has taken that word very seriously, "fourth-class men." The whole civilization is condemned and producing fourth-class men. And that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The intelligent man will have to admit it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> With all the universities and high-class schools they're simply producing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fourth-class men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are discussing in the university homosex. They are advanced. Advancement of education. Just see. They are not even fourth-class men; they are animals, producing so many animals, that's all, dogs and hogs. [break] ...in the beginning <span class="Italic">śamaḥ. Śamaḥ, damaḥ</span>-first two business. Control the sense and keep the mind undisturbed. That is the beginning. Now they are so much sexually disturbed, they're discussing about the profit of homosex. Where is first-class men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They say that homosex keeps the balance of things because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, fourth-class man can say anything wrong, bad, but we are not going to hear of it. A fourth-class man's philosophy, we will have to waste our time to hear them-that's not good. They are not even fourth class; they are animal class. Fourth class has got some position, but they are <span class="Italic">narādhama,</span> the lowest of the mankind. So what is their philosophy, and who is going to spoil his time to hear about their philosophy? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In that verse it says, <span class="Italic">jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyam.</span> What is the difference between <span class="Italic">jñānam</span> and <span class="Italic">vijñānam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānam</span> means theoretical, <span class="Italic">vijñānam</span> means practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana</span> movement is <span class="Italic">vijñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) [break] He is in goodness but sometimes he is attacked by the other two base qualities, passion and ignorance. Then he falls down. Where there is chance of being contaminated, that is not pure goodness. Pure goodness is never contaminated. That is (unclear).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> So pure goodness actually means those eight qualities mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> but without any contamination of the lower qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the material world, goodness is prone to be contaminated. In the spiritual world, the other two qualities, they are not existing. So there is no question of contamination. Here all men are covered by these two base qualities, all men and animal, everyone, passion and ignorance. Therefore, first of all, they have to be brought to the platform of goodness. And if they can keep goodness uncontaminated, they are transferred to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just like you say. Some of the devotees, they fall down although they're striving to be in the mode of goodness. If they're sincere, they still fall down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are sincere, how they can fall down? They are not sincere; therefore they fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Madhudviṣa Swami was telling us once that sincerity must be combined with spiritual strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spiritual strength means sincerity and sincerity means spiritual strength. If I promise before the fire, before the Deity, before my spiritual master that "I shall observe the rules and regulation," and if I don't follow, then where is my sincerity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But the devotees, they're trying to be in the mode of goodness. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, the trying... Then why do you take initiation and promise? You are trying. First of all, you be fixed up. Why do you cheat Kṛṣṇa, the spiritual master, the fire? If you are not fixed up, you should not take initiation. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Arjuna asks...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can fall down unconsciously. But if you fall consciously, that is cheating. I do not want. I am trying to keep myself steady, but still, if I fall, that is excused. But if you purposely... Just like the Christian atonement. They go to the church and admit, "Yes, I have done these sinful activities, so I pay you something. Excuse it." That is not sincerity. And again, next week, he does the same thing. That is not sincerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> What would an example of unconscious falldown be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unconscious falldown, that... Suppose I am prone to... I was very much fond of smoking, but I have given up. So in a society there is smoking, so I become induced. He offers me cigarette, and unconsciously I smoke. Then I must repent, "Oh, what I have done?" That is excused. But if I secretly smoke and outwardly I show I am a devotee, then what is this? This is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that sometimes the living entities are compelled to act because of lust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Even unwillingly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Unwillingly, when it is done, that is excused. And willingly, when it is done, it is cheating. That in your America there was a Moral Rearmament Movement. So it flourished for some days. Their process was admit, admission of sinful activities, that Christian method. "So I will admit. That's all. Again I do. 'Yes, I have done this.' Then my all reaction is gone. Then again I do it." That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, kuñjara-śaucavat,</span> the elephant, elephant's cleanliness. Elephants cleanse very nicely in the water, and as soon as come on the land, they will take dust and throw, immediately. So what is the use of cleansing? <span class="Italic">Kuñjara-śaucavat.</span> You cleanse; again you become unclean. Then what is the use of cleaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Many devotees wish... Now they have become devotees and have had so much bad training, they wish that they could have gone to Gurukula so they would not be so mistrained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, one boy in Sydney, he has been a devotee for a few years, three or four years, but now he has fallen away because of lusty association, I suppose, or bad association. So is this unwilling or willing, because he has become attracted to women again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is one of the defects, our society, that women are there, and one falls victim of these women. And it is not possible to keep the society strictly for men. That is also not possible. But actually no woman should live in the temple. That is the...</div>
