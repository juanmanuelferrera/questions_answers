<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (reading:) "...Kṛṣṇa can be described, not (indistinct) Him, his mind becomes totally associated with Him. His Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in his discourse at the (indistinct) Sunday, said there was no rigid rules and regulations for chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <i class="calibre3">mantra</i>, nor does it require formal education. While uttering the name of Sri Kṛṣṇa one should focus the mind on the image and form of the Lord, His auspicious activities, His delightful sport, and His role as <i class="calibre3">Gītā-ācārya</i>. Lord Caitanya, during His visit to a temple in South India, found a man scanning the pages of the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> without seeming to read the verses, and inquiring, the same found that the person was illiterate and yet he was turning the pages of the <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> at the request of his master because as he did so, he had a vision of Sri Kṛṣṇa expounding spiritual knowledge to Arjuna on the Kurukṣetra battlefield. Thereupon Caitanya embraced him in all admiration for his devotion, sincere faith, and guidance of the spiritual master as necessary for God realization.'' They give very nice article. You have seen it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No. (pause) He doesn't give the receipt number. He says... [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...all the educated men. <i class="calibre3">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ</i> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]. If the, who is called, elite society appreciate, then ordinary people will also appreciate. Before my Guru Maharaja, I mean, Bhaktisiddhānta's..., Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, Lord Caitanya's cult was considered by the higher class as it is the business of the low-class men. Even Vivekananda remarked that "It is the religion of sex,'' because they saw that the <i class="calibre3">sahajiyās</i>, they discussed this <i class="calibre3">rāsa-līlā</i> and have illicit connection with woman. So therefore they took it as the religion of sex. Vivekananda. But now...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are the remark. And now we have to establish this, that this is the only way to reach God. You have to become scholar, philosopher, worker, practical behavior. And that is the fact. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says <i class="calibre3">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</i> [Bg. 18.66]<i class="calibre3">?</i> You have to prove it. And <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> says, <i class="calibre3">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavaḥ</i>: "Except surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, anything, that is simply cheating,'' cheating, <i class="calibre3">kaitavaḥ</i>. Cheating religion. This is challenged by God, "Cheating religion." We have to save people from the cheating type of religion, cheating type of religion, cheating type of <i class="calibre3">dharma</i>. It is so important movement. So this is very good thought of high-court judges. He has stated also, just before that, <i class="calibre3">vicāra</i>. You marked?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Caitanyera dayāra kathā karaha vicāra</i>. <i class="calibre3">Vicāra</i> means statement. Just try to understand the mercy of Lord Caitanya, and give your judgement. This is not a sentimental, as people take it as a sentimental. Most scientific, logical. So how they like that slides?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Very much. I think we may have a brief slide show tonight also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have got all the slides?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We have many slides of paintings, of different activities... [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...have no attachment. These are all nonsense. You cannot be (indistinct). A living being, to become desireless, how you can? I am living. I am not a dead body. Desire should be to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Attachment should be for Him. That's all. You have to change. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You have now attachment for sense gratification, desire for sense gratification. This has to be changed. Purification of desire, purification of attachment. <i class="calibre3">Tat paratvena nirmalam</i> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. Eyes, because it is diseased, you don't pluck out. This is nonsense. Cure the eyes of the disease, then you will see things right. The Māyāvādī philosophy is pluck out the eyes. Buddha philosophy is make it zero. That is also same thing, plucking out. Our philosophy is "No. Cure it.'' That is the difference. It is very simple. Which one is better? Just like a man is suffering from disease, fever, and doctor gives him medicine. He dies. Then the patient's guardian says, "Sir, he is dead now. You have given some medicine, he is dead.'' "That's all right, fever is gone. Fever is gone. Never mind he is dead.'' (laughter) These rascal philosophy statement is like that. Make zero. Make imperson. Then the difficulties of personality... Because they have got very bad experience of personality here. He had to become minister, he has become king and this and that, householder, all botheration. So make imperson. That's all. Negation. Personality is giving us trouble, so make imperson. God must be imperson, because as soon as we have person, there is trouble. They have got experience. (indistinct) as soon as they (indistinct), make it zero, then there is no pains and pleasure. The body, because Buddha philosophy does not give any idea of soul-bodily concept. The body is combination of matter, so dismantle this combination. Just like you have got a skyscraper building, so you have to pay tax. Break it, make it zero, so no tax. This is philosophy. Do you follow? You have got a very big building, so you have to pay tax. To save tax, break the building. No more taxes. No more pains and pleasure. No more anxiety. That is Buddha philosophy. That means these philosophers are called fools and rascal, less intelligent. Would you like this advice, that you have got a big building, just like in London there is a big building, and he has got a policy anyway that he does not allow any tenant. Largest building in London, to save tax. But his point is different. In Bengali there is adage that (Bengali), that a man's utensils were stolen by a thief, so he became very angry, that "A thief has taken all my utensil. All right, I shall not purchase utensil. I shall take food on the floor. I shall take food on the floor. No more utensils. I shall not keep plates and utensils any more. I shall take food on the floor.'' This is philosophy. [break] We don't believe in so-called nonviolence, nonattachment, zero. No. We believe in everything, but if there is required violence, fight, "Yes, come on.'' Yes. Arjuna. No consideration, "The other side my grandfather, my father, or this or that. Kṛṣṇa wants this fight to kill them all.'' <i class="calibre3">Gopīs</i>, at dead of night they went to Kṛṣṇa: "Kṛṣṇa wants us. Oh, we don't care for all this social convention. Kick out. Let us go.'' Prahlāda Maharaja, Nṛsiṁhadeva killing his father, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is taking pleasure in killing my father. That is all right. (laughter) That I don't protest.'' He could have said, "My dear Lord, please do not kill my father.'' Immediately he would have been saved from that. (phone rings)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Could be Puri Maharaja.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go, go, go. So that is our point. Bali Maharaja, he saw that his so-called Śukrācārya, caste Goswāmī, is checking him to offer anything to Vāmanadeva. "Oh, I don't like you. I reject you. I don't want a spiritual master like you, who is checking me for offering to Kṛṣṇa.'' This is a <i class="calibre3">mahājana</i>. Prahlāda Maharaja became <i class="calibre3">mahājana</i>. <i class="calibre3">Gopīs</i> became the topmost devotee. Why? For Kṛṣṇa. They neglected any social convention, this, that. "No. Kṛṣṇa must be satisfied.'' That is the most... That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. [break] (telephone conversation in Hindi with Puri Maharaja) [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So we, we should get tickets today...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we will get tickets.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...for leaving on...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On seventeenth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...seventeenth?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. We shall pay for his expenditure.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And Nityānanda?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Did he say anything about that Nit...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Nityānanda is coming today.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have asked (indistinct), you should also go. So now on the seventeenth we must start.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make arrangements like that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Some party can go tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Rest on seventeenth. And we will see if there is airline connection.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If airline is not possible, we will go by train or... [break] ...preach like this.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> <i class="calibre3">Haribol.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> <i class="calibre3">Jaya</i>. It was very good meeting (?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That for the fifty years they are here, nobody can find. Gaudīya Maṭha is known as Indian temple. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No preaching.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He's making publicity up there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He can take all these placards. Yes. We have got remaining placards?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only point is, "Make it zero. And so long you are living, enjoy as you like, because afterwards you are going to be zero. There is no responsibility. So you gratify your senses to the fullest extent.'' That's all. Just like, I do not know, I have never hanged, but anyone who is going to be hanged, he is offered that "Whatever you want, you can enjoy.'' Is that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...fact?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So their philosophy, "You are going to be hanged. Now you can enjoy whatever you like.'' So this philosophy, that because the Māyāvādī philosophy is impersonal, zero, therefore people don't care for sin. "Enjoy life. You shall finish."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There's the story of a man who is being hanged and they said, "You can have whatever you want.'' So he said, "Whatever I want?'' So they said, "Yes.'' So he says, "I want ten more years life."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't say whatever you want. You enjoy. Gratify your senses as much as you like.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Prabhupāda? What class of impersonalists are worshiping the <i class="calibre3">Puruṣa-sūkta</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hum?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> What class of impersonalists are worshiping the universal form?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, universal form is not impersonal. That is personal. That is also manifestation of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> But you say that... In one of your purports you are saying that the impersonalists are worshiping the universal form.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are advised.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ah, advised to worship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> They are advised to worship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is advised to... There is no worship for impersonalists, there is no...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Oh. (end)</div>
