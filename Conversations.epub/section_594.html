<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Morning walk, L.A., June 22nd. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...palace, fifty-five rooms. Each room is big size with a marble fireplace and the floors are marble and there's a marble winding staircase and several big rooms. And it's got its own chapel, very beautiful. And then the land is very beautiful, 250 acres, as far as you can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is worth taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It seems to be. The price seems to be about the right price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So down payment has been made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, it's already... It's now in our name. It's been transferred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when they are moving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Some devotees have already moved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. It is vacant, vacant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It was vacant, yes. Well, the old owner, he is keeping one room in the building for the time being. The man who sold it to us, he's a very..., Sort of a pious gentleman. He's doing humanitarian work. He's a war hero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> War hero?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. In the last war. (Prabhupāda laughs) So he is also helping us. He has a big factory next to the land and he's letting us use it for the incense business. So he's doing some good service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that factory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He employs these alcoholics and derelicts in different kinds of work, making things. And he was keeping these people living in this palace, but now he's built another place next door where he keeps them and he has them employed. It's sort of an Alcoholics Anonymous group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and they will be rectified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, that's a best thing. Bhagavān hopes eventually to convert them. Anyway, it's a very beautiful place. Especially this time of year, it's very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long it takes to go there from Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> About two and a half hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Two and a half hours? And what is the nearest town?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's near Lyons, Orleans, Orleans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. How far it is from our palace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> About half an hour, I think. It is between several big towns. And it's very centrally located for <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> all over France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, we can go here and there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yeah. They're going to use that as the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> base for our traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> all over France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Parties will go out for a few weeks and then come back. So it's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the climate now? It is cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's nice during the day and a little cold at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Europe is always cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Europe is always cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Always cold. But this palace is in a fairly warm zone. It's got some sort of breeze coming from the Mediterranean Sea, I think. Anyway, it keeps it a little warmer than most places. And it does not snow very much during the winter, they say. Besides the palace, there are some other buildings also. One place they are going to use for a <span class="Italic">gośāla,</span> and one place for a Gurukula. And then several householder houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the land for farming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, at least half the land is good for farming. It's level and there's a good water supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is some river?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, there's no river, but there's a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Waterfall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...pond there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...fifty devotees in Paris now. So that temple there is very crowded. Impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, why not some of them moved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, that's their plan. [break] ...enough for several hundred devotees very easily. [break] They're letting us through in the mornings for nothing now, I think, unless this man is going to nip us. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was in <span class="Italic">maṅgala āratik.</span> I don't know where he is now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmānanda is not come? Nobody knows why? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> He was in <span class="Italic">maṅgala āratik.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was not dancing very much, though. So maybe he was not... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-ballabha:</span> Here comes Brahmānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he comes? (laughing) He is running. Oh, another car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This not like Juhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...Mahārāja feeling separation of māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has constructed Māyāpur. This is very good. <span class="Italic">Āsaktis tad-vasati-sthale.</span> If one becomes attracted in the place of Kṛṣṇa-place of Kṛṣṇa everywhere-especially where His <span class="Italic">līlā</span> was performed... So Brahmānanda, why late today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I was in the temple, chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I didn't think you would come so early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is early?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, earlier than yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't think. What is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ten minutes to six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yesterday you left about 5:40 and today you left exactly at 5:30. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I came just after you left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think your watch is slow. (laughter) [break] ...actual time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's 5:51.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is my?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Your's is about one minute faster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is your?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> 5:53.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fast. [break] ...in my childhood, I remember, I went to see football match in the Maidan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Calcutta Maidan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So when I was returning-of course, I was walking-throughout the whole... At that time our house was that Mullik's house. So from Maidan to Mahatma Gandhi Road I came. And all the watches throughout the road, the same time. Means every watch was, every clock was wrong. But I was going, so I, suppose I saw 5:10 here, then few steps away, 5:10, 5:10, 5:10, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Not any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> In Calcutta it's not that way any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very strict in time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No, every clock is hours off. (laughter) From each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hours? (laughs)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Atonement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whenever we meet the Christians, they always say that "It doesn't matter because Jesus came to save us from our sins. So now it doesn't matter because we're saved."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then Jesus is a fool, and he has taken contract to suffer, and these people are free to commit sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Jesus actually said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are so clever that they can make God's son also fool. Over-clever.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Worship of demigods. They also say, "Putting any god in front of the one Supreme God." Worshiping matter. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Berkeley there's this one demon, so-called Christian, and every day he comes out and he stands behind us with a big sign that "You will not achieve anything by your <span class="Italic">mantras</span> and meditation." And he calls us idol worshipers. And now he writing these big signs, "Don't chant Hare Kṛṣṇa with them." He chanting... He's writing, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," and he's telling... (laughter)</div>

The father of the H-bomb, the man who developed the H-bomb, he retired a week ago, and he said he was very sad that the young people were becoming disgusted with science nowadays, and all the young scientists, they are not as good as the old scientists. They have no desire any more really.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there was a survey of these psychologists, young psychologists, and they asked them whether or not they would like to do research. And the vast majority of the psychologists said no, they don't want to do any research. They don't like to do research because it's all a joke. They don't prove anything. They figure it's a waste of time. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam:</span>" You cannot become a philosopher unless you disagree with other philosopher." <span class="Italic">Nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam.</span> [break] ...something drown?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> They did that to get insurance money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...they are becoming disappointed in science, philosophy, amusement. That is good sign. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...we go to colleges, the young people that are working on Ph.D.'s, they are very... (laughs) They say, "We're doing all this research but you can't prove a thing." I ask them, "Well, this experiment, you know, what will it prove?" He says, "Well, it indicates this, it indicates that, but really doesn't prove anything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) It proves only that he's a fool. That is the only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> I talked to a very nice Indian gentleman. He's a life member. He's a young Ph.D. in chemistry, Dr. Bhatt. He dedicated his Ph.D. thesis to Kṛṣṇa.</div>

He said, "Maybe in twenty years they'll find some way to use the research that I am working on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has dedicated to Kṛṣṇa, very good. [break] ...also dedicated, our Dr. S..., yes, to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> I was very surprised. I was at his home, and I opened it up, and it said "Dedicated to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Scientist." He quoted <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Wolfe also believes in Kṛṣṇa very strongly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You had a talk with him yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said "I believe in Kṛṣṇa unconditionally."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He was very impressed with the bus. He was seeing Rādhā-Dāmodara bus. He was very impressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So whenever a devotee visits him, he is very pleased to see the devotees come and visit him also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, so what is the anxiety? We can take charge of their family. How old he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He's about sixty-five. He's just getting ready to retire. He's retiring this year.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We spoke with him that when we incorporate Berkeley temple as a university, he can be affiliated with that, and he thought that would be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So let him help that our center be affiliated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes. We were thinking if it was, if it pleased Your Divine Grace, maybe he could teach one class in his book, and we can have some students come there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That would be all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> There's this one psychologist. He comes every week to study Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he plays some of the <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> tapes in his office. And there's twenty doctors in his office, and he plays it so all the doctors can hear. And they all come in and ask him, "What is that wonderful music?" He says, "Oh, this is from the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement." He says, "No, that can't be from the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. They just chant and dance on the street the same thing." He says, "No, no, no, this is the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement." They are very, very pleased. He gives all his patients <span class="Italic">mantra</span> cards and tells them, "You should go to the temple. This will really help you." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nudie beach?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...on one side</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> At one time they made it legal to be nude here, and then later on, they repealed the law again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Venice? It is still nude, Venice Beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Is it still? Really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You can either come wearing clothes or not wearing clothes to this beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lucky we come early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Just like the monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh, it was in Laguna that they repealed it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why, then, the lavatory they have made distinction for woman and for men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now in the colleges there's no more distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Co-educational bathrooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One bathroom. One residence, one bathroom...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The boys and girls live in the same residence on the same floors and use the same bathrooms. Practically there is no restriction on the association. They're not married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Congress just passed a law that the health education, means the gym, gymnastic classes... Every day there's physical education class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Must be co-educational. They must be. They passed a law like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Soon they'll get so disgusted with this association, they'll all want to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> When we noticed that this amusement pier was torn down, I didn't think that it meant that they were less interested in amusement, but they have become more degraded in their approach. The amusement pier... They come here instead to be naked on the beach for their amusement. Or they stay home and use intoxicants mostly. That is increasing. [break] ...like a prostitute house. And almost every place they are, not even one part of the city anymore, but you see them everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The woman gives massage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. Always advertising, "Beautiful young girls to massage you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> This is open prostitution now. They advertise very, very, very badly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We had a hearing in Berkeley for our temple, whether or not we could live there, and some neighbors were saying that "These Hare Kṛṣṇa people are no good because they don't have any sex life and don't take any intoxication."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> "They hate sex, they hate women, they hate drugs..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They said, "They are too pure. They will make this whole place... They'll take over this whole place."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "They'll convert the whole neighborhood."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> "They're trying to subvert and infiltrate our philosophy into their neighborhood."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are coming to know what we are. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> (in distance) Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mexican Woman:</span> Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The Mexican people are always a little appreciative. They naturally believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them invitations. Today is Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes, Cit-sukhānanda is speaking with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have no card? Love feast card? Give them, that "come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagannātha-suta:</span> Jayatīrtha has one. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is our enemy, it means Hare Kṛṣṇa is acting upon him. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Like Kaṁsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (chuckles) <span class="Italic">Kāmāt bhayāt krodhāt.</span> Either for lust desires or out of fear, out of anger, some way or other, if one is attached to Kṛṣṇa, his life will be nice. So enemy means <span class="Italic">krodhāt,</span> being angry upon us. "These Hare Kṛṣṇa people does like that." So he is angry. But that will also be effective. <span class="Italic">Krodhāt.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa is so merciful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> One day in London a woman came to try to drag her daughter from the temple. She came into the temple room with her shoes on, and one devotee... She would not remove her shoes, so the devotee pulled off her shoes and she fell down. It was almost like she bowed down. She became so angry, she was shouting in front of the Deities, and I dragged her out and had to wrestle her out of the temple, literally wrestling with her to get her out the door. And she came back in with a policeman, and she pretended to have a fainting spell because we had beaten her so badly, she said. And so she said, "Get me some water," but we didn't have any water, so we have her some milk <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and she drank it without thinking what it was. And so in so many ways-she saw the Deities, she had <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and then she left again, and all this, completely out of anger, but her anger was so strong that she got a lot of association because of it. She was so energetic, I think she could become a devotee some day. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...in America from India. They are so much impressed, Śrīla Prabhupāda. But the most impressive thing for these life members is to come to America and see our institutions. They have letters of introduction. They don't want to live in the temple generally, but they come to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The other, that member, the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Different men. I know. I made these men life members in Bombay, and I happened to be in Washington D.C. when they came there. And they attend the <span class="Italic">āratis,</span> you know. It's very nice. They are very, very impressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> When Kartikeya Mahadevia came to America some time back, he remarked to me that he had come to see all the sights like the Grand Canyon and like that, but primarily he seemed, now he was just simply going from temple to temple because the temples were nice. Nothing else was so nice as he expected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Some life members came to San Francisco, and we picked them up in this Mercedes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's him, that same man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> And they were so impressed that we had such a nice car for greeting the life members. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They talked about that. It's the same man I met in Washington D.C., Mr. Poddar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Mr. Poddar, yes. They said, "Oh, this is the life member car."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One gentleman came to see me in Hawaii. He's also life member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Ramesh Lahoti.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Mr. Lahoti. Yeah, actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he knows you very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Actually, that plan to have a tour is a very good plan if it can be arranged. Because if they get convinced here by seeing this, then, when they go there, they'll speak so highly to so many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that they think that we're bluffing to some extent, but when they come here, they see actually it's not just the pictures that we are showing, but there's something substantial behind the picture. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...the colleges and high schools now that the teachers appreciate the philosophy much more than the students. They have more brain substance, and it's even a possibility many of them will actually become devotees if they have more association because devotees are practically the only intelligent people that they ever get to talk to. Even the other members of the faculty, they are not so intelligent to talk to them. But we went to see one philosopher. He's written seventeen books and he's a distinguished professor of philosophy. We talked to him for three hours, a very famous... His books are used all over the country. He said, "My philosophy is closest to this Hare Kṛṣṇa philosophy, after you've explained it to me." He will be coming back. He's going on tour. He's retiring. We're also going to try to get him to come to Berkeley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Is that the one at Pomona College?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> No, this is another one at U.S.C., University of Southern California.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So some professors wanted to see me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. In fact, one is coming over this afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Today two are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Actually at the University of Southern California around three or four members of the religion department want to come, including the chairman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them come. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...yesterday that Indian gentleman, Dr. Singh? He had become very doubtful when you told him they didn't go to the moon. He was saying, "Do you think they really didn't go?" (laughter) He never thought of that before, that they might have just made a show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If we believe in our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> they have not gone. It is above the sun planet, 1,600,000 miles above. How they can go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, at night, when we see in the sky that moon, that is the same moon that is above the sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes? So their miscalculations are due to their imperfect senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I told Mādhava dāsa in Atlanta that you had said that the sun is actually closer than the moon, and he immediately was able to prove that that is correct. He sat down and he, "Oh..." He was able to prove something by the way they are measuring... They are measuring the distance incorrectly in terms of bending light rays and straight light rays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Sometimes the moon comes in front of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the front?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Between the sun and the earth the moon comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagannātha-suta:</span> Lunar eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Eclipse is different, not according to their theory. That planet is called Rahu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Ah yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not the moon. That's Rahu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So Rahu covers sometimes the sun and sometimes the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This Rahu planet's invisible? We cannot see this with our eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why you believe your eyes so much? (laughter) Nonsense eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> There's this psychology book, and he says that the light spectrum is this long, and that we can see this much of the spectrum of energy. Very nice, this book makes many points that agree with Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So, Prabhupāda, you say that these astronauts have gone to the Rahu planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they might. That is also very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> I was trying to arrange a meeting between Your Divine Grace and this astronaut, Dr. Mitchell, and also this other famous scientist, Werner von Braun. But they are on the east coast at this time, so they couldn't come. But they both wrote nice letters that they would like to meet you if they could be in California at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> This von Braun is a big rocket scientist from the old days. He designed the V-2 missile in Germany during World War II, and then he designed the American missiles during the space program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What benefit he has done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, he's recently said... He retired, and he said now he thinks the only purpose of life is to research about God, to find out about God. He's very famous, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good. They have finished already science. Now if they do not come to God, then they are finished. They have nothing to say any more. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> That is Vedānta. Now they have finished all their so-called talent. Now they have to come to <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā,</span> inquiry about the Supreme. That is their concern now. Now they have cheated public and bluffed them, they are going to this, going to this, but they are all failures. Now they are anxious how to keep their position. That is the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They get lots of money for their position, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because if they are not employed by government with big, big salaries, who will care for them, scientists? Hundreds of scientists may wander or walk in the street. Who will recognize him unless he has got money? I have seen in India. So many scientists are loitering in the street without any employment. Who cares for them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> They will have to go on welfare, Prabhupāda, pretty soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But a saintly person, even he has no money, people care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. [break] ...Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">vidvat tvaṁ ca nṛpatvaṁ ca naiva tulyam kadācana:</span> "A rich man, or a king, and a learned man, learned <span class="Italic">vidvān,</span> they should not be compared. There is no comparison." Why? <span class="Italic">Sva-deśe pūjyate rājā.</span> "A rich man or a king may be worshiped in his kingdom," <span class="Italic">vidvān sarvatra pūjyate,</span> "and if a man is learned, he will be worshiped everywhere." Therefore, he says, "Never compare with rich man with learned man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Therefore it's very important that all the devotees study your books so they become learned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. <span class="Italic">Anarthopasamaṁ sākṣād [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the learning only, to keep them saved from this illusory material energy. [break] ...means knowledge, and this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> is the essence cream of <span class="Italic">Vedas. Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ [SB 1.1.3]. Nigama</span> means <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and this is the <span class="Italic">galitaṁ phalaṁ,</span> ripened fruit of the tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's one professor... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...drags the home. [break] ...living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No. Maybe he is. I think in, he was in Switzerland or some place. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...make research about God. Somebody told me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah. Dr. Werner von Braun. That has been his conclusion now, at the end of his career. He is interested in meditation and self-realization. (end)</div>
