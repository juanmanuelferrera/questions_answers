<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Professor Olivier<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>October 10, 1975, Durban</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, we didn't get the... We didn't get time to discuss some of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> ...the points that you raised, and I came in in the middle of a discourse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know who were those gentlemen. They are your teaching staff, that Mr. Chadda(?) and others? They were introduced as <span class="Ital/div">Ārya-samājīs.</span> They belong to the teaching staff, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> No. The <span class="Ital/div">Ārya-patha-nidi-sabhā,</span> which is an organization which was started about a hundred years ago by Swami Dayananda in India, with a motto of <span class="Ital/div">bhavantu viśvam āryam:</span> "Let us make all men noble through search after truth," and that started in South Africa about fifty years ago. And one of the leading gentlemen in the organization today was the one sitting on the extreme left-hand side, Mr. Chautay. They are celebrating their fiftieth anniversary here in South Africa with a week's program, and they invited these two <span class="Ital/div">ācāryas</span> over from India. One is from Delhi. I don't know where the other one is from. They invited them over to grace their celebrations. So they have been having a week of celebrations starting in the City Hall last Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> This Sunday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> The Sunday that's just passed, yes, they started there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I have a program in the car. Perhaps I could give you the program and you could have a look. All kinds of interesting topics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> For interesting topic, the gentleman, he was introducing himself, "I am God." So what topics we can have with them? (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that "I am God." I do not know what kind of topics they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, the one was the regeneration of the Hindu spirit. I don't know what is meant by that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not belong to the Hindu. They are described in the <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out, <span class="Ital/div">veda-vāda-ratā pārtha nānyad astīti vādinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I have read through the <span class="Ital/div">Gītā,</span> of course, but you see... And I have thereafter referred to certain paragraphs. But it is a book of profound depth, and unless you spend a lot of time going into details, much of it gets lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got this? <span class="Ital/div">Veda-vāda-ratāḥ?</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, here it is.</div>
<div class="Verse">yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>pravadanty avipaścitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>veda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>nānyad astīti vādinaḥ</div>
<div class="Verse">kamātmānaḥ svarga-parā<br class="calibre2"/>janma-karma-phala-pradām<br class="calibre2"/>kriyā-viśeṣa bahulāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>bhogaiśvarya-gatiṁ prati</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the <span class="Ital/div">Vedas,</span> which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Purport: People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the <span class="Ital/div">karma-kāṇḍa</span> portion of the <span class="Ital/div">Vedas.</span> They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the <span class="Ital/div">Vedas</span> many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the <span class="Ital/div">jyotiṣṭoma</span> sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof. In the <span class="Ital/div">karma-kāṇḍa</span> section of the <span class="Ital/div">Vedas</span> it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the <span class="Ital/div">somarasa</span> beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have <span class="Ital/div">somarasa</span> to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called <span class="Ital/div">nandana-kanana,</span> in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of <span class="Ital/div">somarasa</span> wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual. Therefore there are those who are purely attached to material temporary happiness as lords of the material world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, so we are left in this twentieth century, this last part of the century, with a new global search for, or the truth of the spirit. We, of course, in the Western world are not familiar with the <span class="Ital/div">Gītā</span> and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> But our problem is basically, I think, the one that you raised, was how do we make... How do we make a reality, a scientific reality? And I think you were quite right. I think people, very few people, get the point that you were trying to make there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the beginning of <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> scientific reality. Therefore I raised that question. But nobody could reply properly. They thought it a kind of Hindu conception. No. That is not Hindu conception. That is the basic principle of living condition. We are changing body, and there are so many varieties of body. We may enter in any one of them after death. That is the real problem. <span class="Ital/div">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Ital/div">.</span> Nature's work is going on. This body is a machine. This machine, just like a car, has been offered to us by material nature, by the order of God, Kṛṣṇa. And we are moving, transmigration. So the real purpose of life is to stop this migration, transmigration, perpetually from one body to another, one body to another, and revive our original, spiritual position so that we can live eternally, blissful life of knowledge. That is the aim of life. The whole Vedic conception is based on this principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> How do you...? This...your concept of reincarnation, how do you reconcile reincarnation with this attempt to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> So long you'll have desire for material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> This is what is normally in the Hindu religion, you know, which it is not so, of course, in the Christian religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of religion. This is the, I mean to say, our position, real position. Religion develops. Religion is a kind of faith. That develops according to time, circumstances, people. But reality is this, that we are spirit soul. We are now conditioned by the laws of material nature, and we are carried away by the laws of material nature and transmigrating from one body to another, sometimes happy, sometimes distressed, or sometimes heavenly planet, sometimes lower planet. This is going on. And human life is meant for stopping this process of transmigration and revive our original consciousness, and go back to home, back to Godhead, and live eternally, blissful life of knowledge. This is the whole scheme of Vedic literature. And <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the synopsis how to attain this life. Therefore, the teachings of <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins to understand the constitutional position of the soul. Then other things. First of all we have to understand what we are, whether I am this body or something else. This is the first understanding. So I was trying to explain this, but that Mr. Chadda, he would bring that "You want to introduce Hindu conception." It is not Hindu conception. It is the scientific conception. I am a child for some time. Then I become a boy for some time. Then I become a young man, some time. Then I become old man. In this way I am changing body. This is not Hindu conception or Vedic conception. This is a fact. But he would not hear that. He would simply say, "You are trying to push Hindu conception of..." And what is this Hindu conception? It is equally applicable to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier: </span>Hm, true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda: </span>Scientific basis. That is explained in the <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra...</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Find out this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Ital/div"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Ital/div">]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Purport: Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth-either material or spiritual-there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhīṣma nor for Droṇa, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one's work in life. So Bhīṣma and Droṇa, being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So in either case, there was no cause of lamentation. Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature-both material and spiritual-is called a <span class="Ital/div">dhīra</span> or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The Māyāvādī theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable. As confirmed in the <span class="Ital/div">Gītā,</span> the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally, <span class="Ital/div">sanātana,</span> and are called <span class="Ital/div">kṣara;</span> that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same-fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Paramātmā, who is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy, <span class="Ital/div">māyā,</span> then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other being the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of <span class="Ital/div">māyā,</span> no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul deluded by <span class="Ital/div">māyā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> So in the <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> everything is explained very scientifically, not, I mean to say, a sentimental explanation, no. Logically, scientifically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> The problem as I see it, of course, is how to get modern man to make this study in depth that is contained or outlined in this book. Especially when you are caught up in an educational system that denies a place to this very concept or even the philosophy of it, it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> The modern education, they do not accept soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Part of it in theory perhaps, and at the junior stage. But as they...as we advance, there is either a complete neutrality or a...just a simple rejection of these truths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not accept soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> They accept the soul, I think so, but they do not care to analyze what it means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And it is without analyzing this, what is the education? First of all this should be analyzed, what is the distinction between a dead body and a living body. That must be analyzed. Otherwise what is the education? We are dealing with this body. The body is always dead. Just like a motorcar with driver and without driver. The car is always a lump of matter. Similarly, this body, with the soul and without the soul, is a lump of matter. Therefore the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Not worth very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Not worth very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I think about...around fifty-six cents or something. Somebody worked it out the other day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But if one cannot distinguish between the car and the driver of the car, then he remains just like a child. A child may think that the car is running automatically, but that is foolishness. There is a driver. The child may not know, but when the child is grown-up, educated, still he does not know, then what is the meaning of his education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Now, this is the whole range of education in, well, as far as I am aware, in the whole of the Western world, and it covers primary and secondary and tertiary education. There is no place for an in-depth study of...well, of the soul and of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> I talked with one big professor in Moscow. Perhaps you may know him. His name is Professor Kotovsky. He is the leader of Indology in Moscow. So I had a talk with him for about an hour. That talk was published in some paper. He says, "Swamiji, after this body is annihilated, everything is finished." So I was surprised. And he is holding a very responsible post, Indology, and known to be very good scholar. He was good scholar, but he also does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, we have started a course, or we have a course here at our own university in Indology. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda: Here?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah. It is a scholar from Vienna that we have got to teach this course for us. But what he teaches and what kind of basic philosophy, I wouldn't know. There are about thirty or forty students. So in essence, they ought to start by making at least a detailed study, as I see it, of the <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as a basis for their whole philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not appoint somebody to teach <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is?</span> That is essential. And we have got step by step, so many books, fifty books, simply to understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Uh huh. You mean from the beginning right through the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You can make them pass the entrance examination, the graduate examination, the postgraduate examination by studying these books. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, this is apparently what one needs. This is perhaps what one needs, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> And our books are being appreciated, Europe, America, by big, big professors, universities. They are giving us standing order, even in Oxford University. What is that, Oxford University?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I was just in London a while back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that letter is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know if I have the one from Oxford. This is from Harvard. We just received this telegram from Los Angeles, Prabhupāda. "Amazing success from your library party-one hundred and fifty-two standing orders sold in just seventeen days of September in New England. Thirteen standing orders at Harvard. These books are very much being appreciated in America."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> These are for the sets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, a standing order of books even which haven't been published yet. Prabhupāda is translating on his dictaphone each night, throughout the hours of the night. And now about fifty books so far, many more to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> The total number of books will be about eighty. Out of that, we have published about fifty. So the balance they are giving standing order, "As soon as published, you give..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the United States... These are many letters we have, just some of them, from different professors who are actually using Prabhupāda's books, professors from respectable universities such as Harvard, Yale, Duke. Professor Dimmock, who is the leading scholar of southeastern languages at the University of Chicago, he very much appreciates Prabhupāda's books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written one foreword.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So these books are being accepted as the authority, at least in America and England, so far as studies of Indian culture are concerned, philosophy, sociology. And you can see the beautiful presentation. Each Sanskrit is there, transliteration so that anyone can chant, word-for-word Sanskrit to English translation, translation in English, and then the purport, a commentary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> That's right. This is a good edition. Good edition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Professor Dimmock, he says that there are many, many translations of <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and he says that "By bringing us a new and living interpretation of a text already known to many, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda has increased our understanding manyfold." So although it's been prevalent in America... I know that when I was studying Humanities in college in the University of Florida, <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was required. And we read one edition, but it was very much limited. Until we come in contact with <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> the understanding is very much limited. But it's not a sectarian approach. It's purely scientific and realistic. There are many such reviews.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, this is a good letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of our different books, just offhand. These are some of the colleges as of several months ago who placed standing orders for our books. Now, the professors, as we go from college to college in America, in the universities, they are using our books as textbooks, standard textbooks. They are seeing that the cost of the book is not the real criterion. The criterion is the quality of the teaching. Someone may be attracted by the cover... (break) ...transliteration is pronounced, different words, glossary for words which may not be so well understood by the neophyte, references. And for the different pictures, plate numbers and explanation. It's a complete edition. Nothing has ever been seen like this in the Western world. So there's great authority behind it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah. This... Our university has almost an obligation to make a study in depth of all of these points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> And after studying <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> thoroughly, then begins further, higher study-<span class="Ital/div">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> the same principles. Show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same format is used. There is color illustrations, introduction, and Sanskrit transliteration, word for word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Now, would this be... Would this be a... Where would this come in, a book like this, in the study course?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is the postgraduate study of <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> yes. The <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> teaches the general...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is entrance, and then this is graduate. And <span class="Ital/div">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> postgraduate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Our great problem is at the undergraduate level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Well, there is the <span class="Ital/div">Nectar of Devotion</span> and the <span class="Ital/div">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Ital/div">Nectar of Devotion</span> and the <span class="Ital/div">Śrī Īśopaniṣad.</span> These books are actually being used in undergraduate courses. These are some of the recommendations, see, offered as an undergraduate course. Mostly... This book is very, very interesting, this, "the complete science of <span class="Ital/div">bhakti-yoga.</span>" This explains scientifically the science of devotional service to God. That devotional service which is not practiced with reference to the Vedic literatures is simply a disturbance, just as if some chemist walked into an English laboratory or some foreign language laboratory and tried to do something, and he had no knowledge. So the same way, we should try to understand the science of devotional service from the authorities, so that it's not just...it doesn't become simply a disturbance in society. People lose faith in God that way. <span class="Ital/div">Śrī Īśopaniṣad</span> also has the same format once again. The Sanskrit, transliteration, word for word. This is a very nice entrance book into Vedic understanding. This is the most important of the <span class="Ital/div">Upaniṣads.</span> Many other books we have like that, paperbacks and hardbound. This is being used in many universities in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple University, it is a study book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Temple University?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. In Philadelphia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yes, I have been there. There is an Islamic professor there, Professor of Islamics, Farooki. He was also here at the university lecturing in Islam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is University of Minnesota. This is a book review of the <span class="Ital/div">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> He says, "I know of no better introduction to the vast literature of <span class="Ital/div">kṛṣṇa-bhakti</span> than Swami Bhaktivedanta's paraphrase of Canto Ten of the <span class="Ital/div">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Purāṇa.</span> Translators inevitably have to commute between felicity and fidelity. In this edition, Bhaktivedanta resolves the dilemma by presenting a purport of each chapter which is both readable and substantial." No one can argue with the authority of these literatures, it's a fact, because Śrīla Prabhupāda has not manufactured anything from his own mind. It's simply being presented, the Vedic literatures, as they are, in such a way that we in the Western countries, we can understand very clearly without any hesitation what is being said in each verse and each chapter. In other words, Prabhupāda is not presenting in order to confuse or to juggle words, but to actually give people understanding. That is why it's been accepted so readily. We have many such literatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yes, it's... That other letter you showed me, the first one, is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's from Utaḥ State University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah, sociology. It's a good letter. It would be a good letter to have a copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I can make copies of some of these letters and bring them by. Will you be in your office on Monday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I have a meeting in the morning, but my secretary...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I can leave it there. And all of these books are readily available here in stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Are they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We have thousands and thousands of books here in South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> In South Africa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. Very, very reasonable prices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Your Sanskrit professor, he has seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The Sanskrit professor has noted that he would like to take the whole set of books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> What's his name, this professor, Zanenberg?(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One of the devotees spoke to him, but he wanted that I should go back and see him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is? Call him, that devotee who saw him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Was this an Indian gentleman or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Bhargava:</span> Yes, it was an Indian gentleman. I saw him, but I didn't speak to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Which professor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Bhargava:</span> I don't know his name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Probably Mishra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Bhargava:</span> I don't know his name. I saw he was an Indian gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yes. We want to... I mean, I can do very little at the university. My attempts have been to try and stress that the only...the only permanent element in education is the spiritual, and how to effect this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> These are the books. That is a fact. So you saw the Sanskrit professor there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> What is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> He's not a professor. He's a lecturer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Mr. Mishra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Mishra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> Mishra. He's a lecturer. He has this special class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> That's right, yes. He does Sanskrit for us. He's from Mauritius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> And he was interested in getting a whole standing order of books. And I said I could supply the books, but it will be a while before we got every single one from America, including the Bengali books, etc. We have to order them specially because South Africa doesn't have a good communication with America as far as transporting large quantities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we shall supply from here. You haven't got to bother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We have good stock now. We have in stock over a thousand of all these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> We've sold so many that we have to reorder. It won't be much problem getting by air freight. We just put them on the plane and we get them here quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall take responsibility for supplying the books from here, in this center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> But now, what must you...what can you do if your, one of the professor who is in charge of Indology, like the one in Moscow, he teaches Indology but he does not believe the basis of what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> What must you do then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore in America many of our students, they are teaching courses at the university. I for one, I have a B.Sc. in chemistry. I'm actually a graduate in chemistry. I had a four-year scholarship to medical school and some of the other devotees are also graduates, and they are actually teaching in the universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want some of our student to teach, he can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I think one must make a start somewhere, either by getting specialist lectures or lecturers at least to start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We could always assist in some way in an objective presentation so that the students don't feel that they're being biased in any way. This is the idea of science. Let them draw their own conclusions. Just simply present the facts and let them come to their own conclusion. The main idea, though, is the authenticity. There's no use in studying something if it's simply mental speculation, which, of course, the Vedic scriptures mean that. They've been passed down for so many thousands of years intact, and the most important thing is to get a chance to read the originals in our own language, English, or Afrikaans, whatever it may be. We're also translating into Afrikaans the <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Is that so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Some of the girls are very, very proficient and they're doing this now, and we hope that within a year or so's time we'll have a polished copy to print. We're working in this direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> If this line of activity is taken seriously, sometimes I may come and teach them. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is a very nice opportunity because you have all Indian students and they are eager, eager to know. They want to know. And they want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> And they should be helped to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> They should be helped, yes. They should be helped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the purpose of education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Apart from anything else, our Indian, our Hindu community here in South Africa seems to be very loose from any fixed idea of what constitutes Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> And especially the young people, they are therefore living in a complete vacuum. For various reasons they do not want to accept...and I come back to the word <span class="Ital/div">religion</span> again because this is what they have about, or see around them. They cannot identify themselves with the Christian religion. They cannot identify themselves with the Islamic religion. They are largely ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> So they should be shown the right path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> They should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the right path, original, authentic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> There were not very many great scholars in South Africa amongst our Indian community, you know. They came out by and large as workers on the sugar plantations. A few were Christian missionaries, a few were jewelers and tailors and so on. And then for the last hundred years they were occupied in resisting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Political struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Political struggles or resisting this transportation back to India, and they were fighting to make a living, you know, finding their own place in the country. And it's only, as I see that in the future as I've been telling them that we are privileged to have them here in this country with this background, and they mustn't cut themselves away from it and drift in a vacuum. They must give meaning to the essence of their own beliefs and faith. But they do not know to whom to turn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> You see, now, they turn...the senior ones turn perhaps to the <span class="Ital/div">ācāryas</span> that you saw there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The youth are not attracted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> They're not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...because they don't have the answers. The youth want to know exactly. In other words, if a youth asks a question and you can't answer it, he doesn't want to hear from you anymore. But we can answer all questions on the basis of these literatures without any tinge of mental speculation. Scientific, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Then basically they and myself and others want to know how do we get this spirit into our own hearts and how does this then issue out into everyday living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is all explained in the <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā, how to live peacefully in this world and go back to home, back to Godhead. This is the whole thing is explained very nicely.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not that everyone will become a monk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not everyone will become a jeweler or a teacher. But all different occupations must be there in society. Simply they have to somehow or another become God-centered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah. Well, this is the point, you see. Man only lives because God allows him to live. God has given him breath to live, and he's got to breathe God and speak God and live God now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> How to get him to voluntarily make this experiment, because this is what you were saying. Any scientific development rests on experimentation. The challenge to experiment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> ...is there. God does not deny anybody the privilege of experimenting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> And especially the youth at university, as I have always indicated and I tell them every year that they've got to experiment with the spirit to the same extent that they experiment in their laboratories with pieces of animal tissues or grass or what it is that they've got to analyze. But the real tragedy is that we have wandered away so far from the spirit and from the spiritual laboratory...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> ...that we don't know where to start. I was telling them the other day that when the Americans sent their first man to the moon, they had a laboratory of about four thousand men at the controls. The one was doing this and the other one was doing that, but this was a huge human laboratory. That is only while they experiment, and then by that... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> He is my student. He practices like him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah, but now would he have what is normally in the Western world called a theological degree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> He has...theological degree, he has studied all these books. This is theological. But there is no such thing at the present moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah. I can see your problem. But now our problem on this side is, of course, that you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just as in America, I remember at the university...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can give an experiment. We don't charge anything. You see how he teaches. Then if you like, you can appoint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> He would have to be acceptable to the Hindu community because it would be for them only, not for the Christians or for the Muslims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, the Hindu community accepts our movement. Every program we have, we have at least...we've seen at City Hall we had full house, last night (?) full house, and they very much appreciate our movement in particular. They come to us with many questions. So any representative of our movement is pure in his activities and his understanding of the philosophy is comprehensive, so they have no objection. But they see practically that the big men in the Hindu community here, in Johannesburg and Durban...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> You can ask the Hindu community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will testify to our character. They accept. They accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> You see, the...South Africa has had to import its priests, its Hindu priests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even the young girls who join our movement, they cover their heads. And the Hindu ladies are so impressed that they practice such chastity, even to the extent always covering their head as a sign of chastity. They very much appreciate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Perhaps I can give you one or a couple of application forms that you could post to one or two people if they're interested to apply. But this would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> The Hindu community, I think they will accept us. I don't think they will deny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> But this would be a wonderful opportunity to bring the essence of Hinduism because from what I gather here from what you have said, this is not only the essence of religion from here but it is also the essence of Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The essence of Hinduism is <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah. Therefore, one would like to see that the foundation of any course which is given here in Hinduism is a pure foundation, unadulterated. Therefore, based on the <span class="Ital/div">Gītā</span> and the Upanisads and the Veda, all the Vedic literature, because that's all that's available. But the trouble is, you see, as it is, whether it is Christianity or whether it is...I don't want to speak about Islam because I don't know enough about them, but there is always the danger that you will get intellectual expositions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, this is the idea of presenting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> ...without the faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...presenting as it is. In other words, let them draw their own conclusions. In other words, it's not simply that you're trying to flatter some people that they know so much if they don't know. You're trying to educate, which means uplift. So simply we present the principles that are here and let the people become elevated, educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, are your book lists in here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> And you've got another copy of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, you can keep this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Are the prices in here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, the prices...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, price is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I can give you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, price is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The American prices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter. Price is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some of them are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> In case we want to order them for our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can order here. You can get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of these books we have available at this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> These are introductory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think in the beginning <span class="Ital/div">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Well, thank you very much, sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> ...for sacrificing the afternoon for me like this, and God bless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you, yes, for your...(chuckles)...thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So shall I come by your office Monday with some copies and then (?). I myself, I have to go with Srila Prabhupada to Johannesburg on Tuesday morning, and right after the programs there are finished I'll come back to Durban and pursue this further with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Yeah, let's see what we can...we can discuss. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Thank you very kindly. Thank you for coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> Now, you mustn't take so many (?) that it will make one egoistic. Good night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (?) You know, we have our Back to Godhead magazine published (?) copies per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> What do you call it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prof. Olivier:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para">(voices fade as they walk away down hallway)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Devotee:</span> He was a nice man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Ital/div">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice man. Therefore, I called.</div>
