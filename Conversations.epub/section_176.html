<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>London, August 10, 1971</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> There's already a big church on it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> That may be better, because there's more space there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We haven't seen it yet. We haven't gone inside yet.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I'll try and make arrangements to go and have a look at that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And also that other one around the corner.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> The (indistinct) chapel? That's a very large building. But you can't go outwards(?). You can't go up. And there's no other facility.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Near Oxford. A very large building, but it's, it's in a bad state of repair.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We'll concentrate on the other ones.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> (indistinct) best as far as the land's concerned. It's situated in the biggest area of space.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I have to try to find out when George is coming back.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> George can give his..., what is called?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Endorsement.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Endorsement?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What is called? Reaction, or...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> His qualities?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The show, what is called?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Concert.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Concert show.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better he can raise funds from New York, but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, most of the money that they get from these concerts is not on the concert itself but on the record album and the movie that comes from it, the film.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> And the royalties.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Royalties from making a record of music and the film of the show.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uh-huh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Just like Bangladesh. They raised about a million dollars from the concert and nineteen million from the record album and film. So those two don't require any special place. They could be anywhere.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Better here though, because George has never made any public appearances...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Actually I think it would be just as big here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes. If the result, if people knew, if it was...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He's never made a public appearance. Only one in America.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Everyone from all over Europe will be coming to see him, without a doubt... In Europe there's about 350 million people, almost 400 million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Actually he made two statements that, well, they practically promised to do this. He said in Los Angeles when he saw the Deities: "Oh, we must have a place like this in London.'' And then in New York, because I said, "Well, we don't want to be on your show here. We volunteer. You promised...,'' I said, "You promised us to be on the show in New York, and he said, "I know I promised, and I must fulfill my word, I gave you my word, but I'm just asking you if you will not be on this show, and later I'll have another special concert for Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So remind him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about these Hindu communities?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, that we can do during this time you're here. We can organize it. We can at least inspire them to help us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Are they willing to cooperate with us or not? Because they have already opened some Hindu temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There's not so much cooperation from them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They want their own local temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> They come here and they stay for <i class="calibre3">ārotik</i>, they take a little <i class="calibre3">prasāda</i>, they give some money, then go.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They, the Indians know how to organize those things better that we do. They know how to collect money from individual Indians in their neighborhood, one, two pounds at a time. They can do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> We went out to an Indian concert one night at Southall.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> This was..., we were very welcome, made very welcome indeed. And they had like a very small television, and they had pictures of the Deities there, and Hare Kṛṣṇa, (indistinct) about the chanting, and they loved it. I should mention there must have been about five hundred people in that hall.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> There's no Hindu temples on the West End, West End.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> There's one in (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, there is?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Sikh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Sikh, yeah. But I mean Hindu temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> I don't think the leaders, the leaders of these communities, they're not so willing to raise funds on our behalf.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> I don't think the leaders of the Hindu communities, they're not so willing to raise money on our behalf. They'll do it for their own functions, and their own temple requirements, but not on our behalf. And it's a weak...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I'm thinking of the way Sadha Jivat Lal(?) raised so many <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of rupees, by selling, organizing, highly organized...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If they will, they can.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he says they're not willing. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I don't think they're willing at this stage, my lord, because there's been so little done for them, and I feel, and I...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, we're having Jagannātha parade, Prabhupāda is speaking...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Yes, but in their own communities, we, I suggested a long time ago that in fact there should be an appeal, start off with an appeal in the local papers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The priestly class, they will make propaganda against us: "Oh, they are <i class="calibre3">mlecchas</i>, they are Europeans, they are Americans. What they can do? It is not good.'' Because India, the caste system is very strong. So I am giving the Europeans and Americans the opportunities to become <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i>, they are not satisfied.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Also they say that here in our temple they don't let anyone else speak, so why should we..., they, why should we let them speak? This is what they say. Because we don't allow them to come, you know, and talk on Hinduism, so they say, "Why should we ask, let them do it here, in our community?"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Still, they're asking us to supply them <i class="calibre3">pūjārīs.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">:Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They're asking us to supply them <i class="calibre3">pūjārīs. </i>Out of all their community, not one man will volunteer to be the <i class="calibre3">pūjārī.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">:Prabhupāda:</span> They're asking us for <i class="calibre3">pūjārī?</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not take charge?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> At the Hindu center, didn't they ask, a couple, "Come and live there, be <i class="calibre3">pūjārī,</i>'' and...? I was hearing that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we cannot become <i class="calibre3">pūjārī...</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Under their, under their direction. That's the trouble.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So they have, they have already installed a Deity. They have a Deity of Vasudeva in the Hindu Center, but He's not dressed. He's standing with <i class="calibre3">cakra</i>, but He's not, He's not clothed very nicely, and the room is not decorated very nicely at all. He's just standing there. And they asked for a <i class="calibre3">pūjārī</i> to come and look after. But they..., you see what they're thinking, they're thinking, "Oh, we're pious. We're pious for acquiring Deity.'' You see? "Deity is only for the lower class people, so they can see, or they will be reminded that God is here. But we already know that God is here.'' So they turn and sit with their back to the Deity and they talk like this, and the Deity is here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They, as Dhanañjaya said, that are not willing to cooperate with us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, I'm not so sure. They used to be when I was here, and I think if you have a <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata-saptāha</i>, if the weather stays, and the weather's any good... I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata-saptāha</i>, if they are willing to cooperate with <i class="calibre3">our</i> <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata-saptāha.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, that's what I mean.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some, some priest come from India, and they cooperate with me. But if they have a feeling of noncooperation with us, then what is the use of <i class="calibre3">paṇḍitas</i> and <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata-saptāha?</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Saturday night you'll be speaking in the Hindu Center?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> On the fifteenth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Saturday, next Saturday night. So that will be a good indication. We'll know after then, if they cooperated, if they'll come. I think there'll be a big crowd.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Actually, you see, it's the younger Indian families also. They're English. They're not Indian. They're more English than Indian. Their children, they don't speak Hindi, and they're playing just like Western children. So they're, when they see us, when we, when devotees go there, to the communities, they're so eager to take the books 'cause they can read them and they can relate with, with Kṛṣṇa consciousness somehow. Because they go every Sunday to their meetings there, and they hear the priest, and it's all boring. It's for the older, for the old. It's sentimental. That's all. So the older people, they're coming, and they're listening to the readings of the <i class="calibre3">Rāmāyaṇa</i> and so many other things. And the young people, they know, "Oh, these, these European people and American people, they must be doing something genuine. Otherwise why are they sacrificing so much?''</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how to attract the Indian younger people?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But then again, they're influenced...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They've asked us in that Hindu Center to teach classes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They've asked us to teach classes also in that center.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you do that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Not many people come, though. But we could attract them to come. Advertise and attract.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> See, that..., their main function is on a Sunday, and the last time Your Divine Grace came there, last year, that's where they hold their meetings, in that hall. But it's full of so much nonsense. They have pictures of Vivekananda...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you call that Dr. Shah?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Dr. Shah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot help us?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I don't know. We're still not sure about him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that one Mr. Ahujya came?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Uh-huh. There are many men here who respect us, who would help us...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wanted me to go to his house.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ahh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From that Auckland.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, he's from Auckland.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he visited there...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, that's right, I know him. I have his card, yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got his card?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you call him just now?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, I have his... I think I have his phone number and everything too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So call him so he can come here just now. He was talking seriously about "You please come immediately."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I have his Delhi address too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now suppose the estimate is 250,000 pounds. So how much the bank may advance?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I don't think the bank, in this state of, of, umm, the one at King Street, Hammersmith...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> The one at Kings Street, Hammersmith. I don't really think the bank will advance you anything. Umm, you see you've got nothing to mortgage.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> This is the first thing. You see, when we're talking of Kingsway Hall, you know, the big one, before, well here you had a bank on the site, and they were rather anxious to keep their premises, and consequently they would have loaned us money to retain their site. Any of these four that we're dealing with at the moment, there are no other banks or building societies on the site. This is what I think is, is absolutely imperative, that within the...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The bank will not be prepared to advance in such property?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Well, they may well do, but it would only be... One couldn't guarantee that they would be expected to. But the bank manager, where the account of this temple is kept, they may be tempted to loan a half or three quarters of it, if they think that the thing is a good... I mean, this site at Kings Street, Hammersmith, for instance, if we don't buy it, then the suggestion is that within the very foreseeable future the place will be pulled down to build a large hotel, which means to say that the site is very valuable. On this score, the bank may well be tempted to loan you some money, just on the site alone, (indistinct) the premises. They would be interested.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then means that a church turned out a new building. So that is a big stake.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Mr. Dwyer was very anxious that the Dawson Place should have been purchased, or some house of a similar nature, because these can be used.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (re: Mr. Ahujya) He'll be calling up in a few minutes. He's just gone out. She said she would tell him. He has an Indian Handicrafts house.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose we can arrange for the money, somehow or other, half. Half a million required?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> For, for the new premises.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One fourth million if we can arrange. So is it possible to arrange for the other one fourth million from the bank?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I think that if you're putting up a quarter of it, a quarter of a million, then I think there's every certainty of the bank loaning you the other quarter. I think this is quite a definite circumstance.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> See, because what they do is they loan the money on the strength of the value of the property. If the value of the property is 500,000 pounds, then they'll be quite...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you try for this property?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I will need the help of this Mr. (indistinct). I can try to raise that one fourth million, and one fourth million if the bank advances, then we can negotiate immediately.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It would be nice if the Indians could help.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do some practical proposal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far George is concerned, now it is more or less Utopian.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You can't count on him at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...if he was willing, he would have done long ago, but he is not very serious.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, I've never asked him for it, to do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is this asking? When he visited our Los Angeles temple, he appreciated and he said, "Why not a temple like this in London?"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well he's..., I..., He's been waiting for me to come here and talk to him here about it. I haven't...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is difficult to meet him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, he's just out of station now. As soon as he's in station I'll get him, I'll meet him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you call him in New York?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I don't know where he is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you are getting.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I don't know where he is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they can say, his men here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> His men here won't say. They don't know themselves usually. Only his wife or one other, two persons know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So his wife is here?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They're all with him. His manager, Terry, is there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Bob Dylan would know where he is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, but Dylan changes his number about every two weeks. I have his old number from a year ago. I'm sure it's not the same.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he agrees, he can in one night, he can.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, I have one number in New York who would know where he is. Al Abramovitz(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I wonder whether this large records firm in New Oxford Street...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Warner Brothers?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> No, no. Record. James something or other. James...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, right over here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Yes, in New Oxford Street.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> They're agents for practically every...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, the, one of the, man who works there, big man, is also with George now. They might know where he is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> ...something to do with that particular firm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Derrick Taylor.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Kenny Records.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Kenny, Kenny Records. Well, there are several record agents. They might know...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> The whole building is taken up, and it all comes under the roof of James something or other, or agencies.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Now in New Oxford Street, you can see it very easily. There's a Midland Bank, takes up the ground floor.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's right over here, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, so long I am here, let us try some tangible, not simply proposal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Now we've seen how nice places we can get, so we have to work on these other angles: the Indian community and George.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> The bank</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And the bank. There's... What about Mr. Gopal? Did you see him? He's very wealthy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, but he helps by donating material things. Not material things, but he likes to give things rather than...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No, he's never been tactfully approached for anything else. He used to like us. He'd come around all the time. He lost his son, so he adopted us, like that. He used to give us presents, money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The most he's given is carpets.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Carpets. He was giving carpets. The purple carpet in the temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> The carpet in the temple cost how many hundreds of pounds?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Three hundred pounds. And the material for the Rathayātrā cart. All the material.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He lives in Stretton.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Near Stretton.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Do you have his phone number? I'll call him, call him. He's, I'm sure he..., we could count on him to give something for...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So take their consult, what price they want.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There's also Nandalal Chabria, Mr. Chabria's son, he's here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He's not very wealthy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, he's not wealthy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Chabria is here?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. His son.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Nandalal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nandalal?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is his father's name?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Rāma, Ramachand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Ramachand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There's Mr. Padma(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Those men might help do legwork, but they're not wealthy in themselves.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you raise one fourth million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Okay. (begins laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Mr. Arnold will help for the bank one fourth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I don't think I can get my bank to loan it, my lord, but certainly we'll go and see the bank... (laughter by devotees)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we'll pay gradually to the bank. Then we can immediately...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> You see, the tragedy is, my lord, they haven't got one account in this temple in my bank.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Then why don't we go and take an account in his bank?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Mr. Arnold's in the Midland Bank.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not open all the accounts there? Or ask the present bank that we are proposing this. Otherwise Midland Bank is a famous bank, it is nice bank.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Well I suggest that they, they should go to the National Westminster and tell them that you'll want this loan for...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they agreed, National Westminster.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To agree to pay on account of this Kingsway.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Oh, no. That was Lloyd's that agreed then, because they were trying to save their premises. They knew perfectly well that if it went to someone else then the whole premises, sooner or later, would be torn down.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So he's, he promised them perpetual lease.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At what price it was being sold?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Two and a half million pounds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Two and a half, which is exactly the price that I told them to put the bid in for. I went over...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two and a half million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What Dāyananda didn't tell us is that the bank was prepared to finance the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> The whole thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Well the bank and the building society.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> One building society and one bank combinedly would have financed the whole thing, but he sent us a letter that said only two-thirds, they would finance two-thirds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is not very intelligent. A missed opportunity.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> See, I went to the Midland Bank, to various departments, and I found out almost to within a penny what exactly what it would raise. Of course, some of the people that put in the bids it happened were Midland Bank customers. I know I shouldn't have done it, but I did it, and I...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The bank was prepared to finance it, and he missed that opportunity?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, and he didn't even tell us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> The bank was only going to loan two-thirds. Then the building society next door was going to help, and also the National Westminster was prepared to help, I'm quite sure. But of course, I think...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was not tactfully done.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not intelligent.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He didn't tell us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Had he told us a hundred percent financing...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> I pleaded with him to send you a letter. Of course you told him that to only put in a bid for a million and a half, and I pleaded with him to send you a letter that said no, step the bid up to two and a half million. Because quite honestly, I feel that the place was so vast, and most of it was let-places like Decca Recordings, Kodak, things like this-that most of the repayments to the banks would have been met quite easily.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I asked him also to consult some expert.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, somehow or other...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was two and a half million, and it is half million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Perhaps it's better if we go step by step.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Someday we'll go up into the big place. There will always be a big place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But there was not even a thousand pounds here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There wasn't even a thousand... At the time, there was not one, even one thousand pounds in the temple fund, and they were going for a two and a half, one and a half million deal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The bank was prepared to finance. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> You see, I sort of schooled Dāyananda and told him to go over and have words with the bank manager, promising that, you know, if they helped us to fund this building, then we would guarantee them tenure, and instead of paying interest back on the, on the loan, we, for bids, we would give them a guaranteed tenure, or peppercorn rent, but we would pay the original loan back, so that there was no charge at all, it was just...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, <i class="calibre3">na tasya śocananarthi. </i>Don't lament which is gone. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Yes, thank you, thank you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Don't cry over spilt milk.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Sanskrit, <i class="calibre3">na tasya śocananarthi.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Actually, for a place in the center of London like this, it's nice to have offices and a small chapel and maybe a bookstore, but we would not be able to recruit many people to come on a residential basis, being in the center of the city. But in a place a little bit further out, like in a student neighborhood, everybody comes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What? Student neighborhood?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes, they'll come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, why not negotiate that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Daily they'll come and then gradually become devotees.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, among the young men there is hankering after this sort of an institution. Everyone asks me, "Why the younger generation is attracted to this movement?'' so many reporters. So somehow or other, I reply, "The young men, they're receptive, they can understand the value, whereas the old fools cannot.'' (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> Well, my wife and I, we can. We're old.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) You are excepted. You are excepted. Sometimes old men are called old fools. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Mr. Arnold:</span> My wife is twice..., she's older that I am, and she's made me return because sometimes I've lost my temper with, over, you know, various things that happen...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is that you are liberal to understand things as they are. But generally, old men, they are sophisticated. They do not like to accept anything new: "Go away.'' Or they are not serious about religion. That is another thing. Actually..., as I see that old, older section, they have been habituated in a different way, so they do not want to change (indistinct). That is the difference. So "Here is a nice thing; you should accept it.'' They are not inclined in that way. All stereotyped. Just like you have said last night, I told Lord Zet... (end)</div>
