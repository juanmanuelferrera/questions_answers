<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That there is no brain behind this creation. How foolish they are. There is no brain in this artistic work. And how wonderfully, because it is automatically coming, artist. Anything, you take flower. So, without brain how this thing can happen? But these rascals they do not understand. They say nature. What is this nature? Nature is an instrument, but the brain is God. Just like you paint a flower with the brush. The brush is not the creator of that painting, you are creating. Similarly, it appears that it is happening naturally. Nature is only brush, but the brain is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yet no two are the same, are they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They are not the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Varieties. Everything is variety. Everything is variety, full of varieties. We find the same species of rose. Still, you'll find varieties. In human, twin brothers you will find still varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And in Goloka Vṛndāvana, are there still varieties? Are there still varieties in Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Goloka Vṛndāvana, are there still varieties he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. There are varieties. <span class="Italic">Ānanda, ānanda,</span> pleasure means varieties. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. Without varieties, just like we prepare from grains, sugar, ghee, hundreds of varieties. If you simply give grain, ghee and sugar, it will not be enjoyable. But the same thing, you prepare in varieties and give you a plate, oh, you'll say, "Oh, so nice thing." The ingredients are the same. Grains, ghee and sugar, that's all. Similarly, this material world, the ingredients are the same. Namely five gross elements and three subtle elements, finer. Earth, water, air, fire, sky. These are gross elements. And mind, intelligence, ego these are finer elements. Combined together this material world has come. The brain behind is a living entity. Just like we are using these ingredients, these five elements: earth, water, air, fire, sky, making this building, making this table, making this chair, vase, so many things, harmonium, pictures, book. So the ingredients are the same, but my brain is working in different varieties. My brain or your brain. Human brain. Similarly this material cosmic manifestation is full of varieties. The brain behind it is Kṛṣṇa. That is stated, you have read our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I've taken a look.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a verse. Find out:</div>
<div class="Verse">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sūyate sa-carācaram<br class="calibre2"/>hetunānena kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>jagad viparivartate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.10]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sūyate sa-carācaram<br class="calibre2"/>hetunānena kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>jagad viparivartate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.10]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature. Kṛṣṇa also states in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>that of all the living entities in different forms and species, "I am the Father." The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the <span class="Italic">smṛti: </span>when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is modern science materialism, Prabhupāda? Is it materialism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> All, all materialism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just dealing with earth, water, air, fire, sky. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And in this time, modern science, you know, physics, chemistry, mathematics; is this all materialism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> All materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And inside these people doing this work, is it Kṛṣṇa? Or what is it makes them do the work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The soul is a living being. So nature is supplying material and he's molding in different forms. Just like earth is not man's creation. Earth is God's creation, or it is product of God's energy. But we are using this earth and molding in different forms, different pots, different dolls. So ingredients are supplied by God. Nature means God's energy. We simply handle them. We cannot produce anything, we transform only. Just like this iron, we cannot produce iron. It is gotten from the mine, iron bar. Now we have transformed into different forms. Because we have got creative energy like God, not very great, in very minute quantity. So as God has created by His intelligence, the whole universe-we are creating this table, this pillow, this harmonium-that's all. What you are finding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> I was just looking at that verse again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Verse">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sūyate sa-carācaram<br class="calibre2"/>hetunānena kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>jagad viparivartate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.10]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the perfect information of everything. One has to study carefully, that's all. It is perfect information. And you can accept it with your good logic. Not that blindly you accept. Now just like Kṛṣṇa says: "The material elements are My energy." Now you can consider, you can argue, you can make argument, you'll come to the conclusion. Just like material elements, water, the vast water. The ocean, Atlantic Ocean, vast water. So it is created by God's energy. How can you explain with your argument? Because it is said there, Kṛṣṇa says, that "This is My energy." Now, if you accept it, it is all right. But if you have got hesitation, what is your reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Because one man says one thing and one man says another thing. So many people have different things to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, personally. Suppose I ask you. What is your, you want to ask me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You have, that letter has a return address from Maṇḍalībhadra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is here. Now the water... Just like from your body, water is produced, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Transformed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transformed or whatever, but you see urine is coming, perspiration is coming. So these different waters are produced by your energy within the body. So why not from God's energy the vast water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, truly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But why should he give us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because God is unlimited, He has got unlimited energy. have got limited energy. I can pass urine, say one pound, I can have perspiration say, one ounce but if God likes He can produce unlimited water. Why this one Atlantic Ocean? Many millions of Atlantic Oceans He can produce. Water produced from His body. So where is the difficulty to understand? When Kṛṣṇa says that the elements... Other matters are growing. Just like the hair. Now, today, I have shaved. Three days after, again it will grow. So I have got my energy within by which I'm constantly growing. But, hair is a material thing. So anything you take, it grows from the Supreme. It is very easy to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hmm. And ah, this inside, it grows because of Kṛṣṇa does it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is growing on account of Kṛṣṇa. Your body, inside or outside, it is made of these five elements: earth, water, air, fire, like that. It is nothing but combination of these five elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is the water inside the same as the water in the ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's the same water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You... Have you tasted ever perspiration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perspiration, have you tasted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Tasted it, yes, salt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salt, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ocean, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But one ocean is not the same as another eh? My business is mathematics. It's not very transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are teacher?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, not anymore. It's not very transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He's asking if his business is transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if it is used for Kṛṣṇa, then it is transcendental. If it is used for your sense gratification, then it is material. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. And how do you know whether you're using it for Kṛṣṇa or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That requires training from the Kṛṣṇa's representative, guru. Just like these boys are being trained up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So it requires little training. Just like you are mathematician. To make another student mathematician, you have to train him. You have to teach him how to calculate two plus two equal to four. It will never be five. If somebody says, "No, my calculation is two plus two equal to five." Will it be accepted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I'm afraid sometimes it can be true. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it can be true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One plus one can equal three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One plus one can equal three sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there mathematical calculation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I know that it's ah... I mean things reproduce. Life is not so fixed, not so rigid. But one does have to be trained, it's true. Training is, some people can understand and some people cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is difference of understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The fact is true. But if I cannot understand, that is my misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. And if I can't understand what this is the end of the... So yes, it's the same. I think this is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is fact. But if somebody cannot understand, it is his misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. And another time, another place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> As you say, there are many oceans. The Christians say, "In my father's house are many mansions." A Chair. (indistinct) Good enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> This has come a long way from the Barrier Reef, the Pacific. These shells. The shells.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> From the Pacific. From the Barrier Reef, Australia. You know the Barrier Reef?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, that's where they come from, the Barrier Reef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen the reef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Oh, yes. I would like to see that. The sea is wonderful, isn't it? You like the sea they tell me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Very green, clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Always a different color though. Always a little different isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, reef I have seen. It is about, not less than two hundred feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Really? They say under the water is beautiful, the light, and the color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They go under the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They go, yes, under the water, in skin-diving. The coral, coral? Grows coral doesn't it? They say it's all, very beautiful. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Well, thank you, Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">jaya.</span></div>
