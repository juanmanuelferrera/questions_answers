<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I came to offer my obeisances to you. I became a life member as a result of Gopāla Kṛṣṇa's talking to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, sir, here. I came to offer you obeisances in Brooklyn temple, and I asked you a special permission as my Gurudeva, which you gladly gave me, to teach <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> in Poughkeepsie, where I am. Since then I have been trying to do your work sincerely in Poughkeepsie.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Poughkeepsie. Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It is hundred miles north of New York. I work there. I am an engineer, and I have been trying to spread Kṛṣṇa conscious movement of yours, trying to teach from your <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> to the Indian community, and I have been slowly trying to get American people also involved. And, as I see, more and more American people are now coming in. And in fact, those people who are very steadfast, who come to attend my class, are the American people. I am very glad to see that they are taking very great interest. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indians are not taking so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, sir, I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indians are <span class="Italic">baḍa sāheb(?)</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Ah. You see they have been going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I wanted to just finalize when you would join the festival tomorrow. I wanted to fix that up, so I could, you know, just do that. We're leaving Fifty-ninth Street at two o'clock, and we're reaching downtown, the park, at four o'clock. In other words, it takes two hours, the route. At four o'clock we're going to have a Winnebago. Winnebago is like a small bus which has a, it has a lavatory in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like Satsvarūpa Mahārāja's traveling bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. It has a bathroom in it. That's going to accompany the parade in case at any time you require it, that will be right there. So it can go alongside the cart. At four o'clock we'll arrive, and at about four-thirty Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja will give a short introduction for you, and at four forty-five you'll speak. So at four forty-five you're expected to give the lecture. It begins at two o'clock at Fifty-ninth Street for two hours. Then by five or five-fifteen the whole thing will be over. So I wanted to know what time you would like to join the parade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you suggest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it depends on a number of things. One thing is your rest. After taking massage you take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and then your resting period. Another thing is how long you want to ride along on the cart. It depends on... I think it should depend on... I can't... No one can make that decision. We're agreeable to anything that you suggest. Devotees are enlivened simply that you're here in New York with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at two o'clock you start?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You want me at the starting point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We want you to do simply what you feel would be best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What is the best? Starting point, my presence required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it's not a question of required. I mean that's a very exciting time, you know, but I wouldn't say it's required. We're going to start. One way or the other, we have to start the parade. It's exciting at that time, but you could also join midway. Suppose you could also join at Thirty-fourth Street instead of Fifty-ninth Street. Halfway is about Thirty-fourth Street. So you could join there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That would be about three o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That would be at about three o'clock. It depends upon your resting period also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I will adjust. That is not the thing. I want to know when my joining will be very good. That I want to know. At the beginning or the middle, in the last, that you have to decide. Then I shall adjust. In London, I think... Of course, the whole route I was present, but that was little troublesome because sometimes I am called by nature. But you say there will be a car. So under the circumstances, which time will be good? That you say. Then I shall adjust. That you consult, which time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, if I can have about five minutes, I'll ask a few people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then I'll adjust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you're agreeable at any time as long as that convenience... That's a good convenience, I think, that we'll have that vehicle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I'll just inquire. This is a general idea of what's going on the whole day tomorrow. I'll leave it with Hari-śauri.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The preaching is going on. Nobody has become our student?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Among the Indian people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian or European or American, it doesn't matter. Since you are preaching there, has anybody joined this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, sir. I have been begging. I've been begging people. Now I know that two American people will become steadfast, and I will make sure that they join the movement, but among the Indian people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether you have joined?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I have joined. I'm a life member. I come to the temple. I study your books all the time. I have your photo. I do your <span class="Italic">ārati</span> every day without fail. Without fail. Nayanābhirāma came to my house two weeks ago, and I showed him everything, Kṛṣṇa and your photo next to it, and I every day do <span class="Italic">pūjā.</span> Complete vegetarian and we are doing <span class="Italic">ārati</span> every day, first obeisances to you, my father-mother, and Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your father-mother here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No. They are dead now. They have expired. But I still offer my obeisances to them. First obeisances to you, then to Kṛṣṇa, then to my father-mother, and then I start my <span class="Italic">pūjā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And I do complete <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and everything because I want your blessings. I wish that I have a guru like you every birth after birth. But one of the problem, Prabhupāda, personally, I have found among the Indian people is that because we are used to so many demigods, they still don't accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are so many arguments I get that like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of argument. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but if they do not accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as the authority, then they are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So fools cannot be enlightened. That is the difficulty. If they do not accept the authority, then they are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. After I teach <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and I try to tell them to please sing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not their fault. Even the big, big leaders of India, even Gandhi, they do not know actually. Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has been misinterpreted, misused by the leaders, by the politicians, by the so-called philosophers. Everyone has misused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I'll tell you one thing, that Swami Chinmayananda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a great...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He's great, but I'll tell you what happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Great" means great fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. In Third Chapter where Kṛṣṇa is saying, "Renounce your everything to Me." Okay? And the word <span class="Italic">matam</span> is used, <span class="Italic">matam.</span> Now Swami Chinmayananda is saying, "That's my opinion," that's what Kṛṣṇa is telling, and they will be freed of all the work. And you have written <span class="Italic">matam</span> means scriptural injunctions. And I tried to show the students who come to the class that "This is the difference. Look at this, very big difference," because if Kṛṣṇa is only giving His opinion, then He's talking like a diplomat, not talking like God. But if He says, "This is the law..." And I explained to them that like Bible has got ten commandments...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And another thing, even Kṛṣṇa says, giving His opinion-that's taking it as it is-Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So He's the supreme authority. So supreme authority's <span class="Italic">matam</span> is a high-court judgment. There is no argument anymore. The judgment is given by the high-court. Final decision. So if Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, then who can give him better opinion than Him? For argument's sake, even if He says... Any gentleman will say like that, that... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "You do it." He is Supreme Lord, He can force you, but He does not do that. So although His <span class="Italic">matam</span> is the Supreme, but as a gentle preacher, He says, "That is My <span class="Italic">matam.</span>" But if you are sane, if you know that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority, then His <span class="Italic">matam</span> is final.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And that's why I try to show the difference to people, that "Please follow Prabhupāda's <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> And please make sure that when you read, you read <span class="Italic">Gītā As It Is.</span>" This is why I'm trying to show the differences to people. Personally there is only one question I have, and that is, throughout all the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams</span> that you have translated so far, I see all the time any, like Kardama Muni or other, all other great sages, whenever they do <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> every time Mahā-Viṣṇu comes down. Now I know that throughout other, even <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> you have considered Mahā-Viṣṇu as an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet Mahā-Viṣṇu is coming every time as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So what is the subtle position here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no difference between... Just like... It has been explained in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā.</span> Just like one candle, then you kindle another candle, then you kindle another, another, another, another. So you say, "This is first, this is second, this is third, this is fourth..." But so far candle power is concerned, they are all the same. Either you take first or the second or the third, so far the candle power is concerned, that is all the same. Still, you have to say, "This is first, this is second, that is third, this is fourth..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I was trying to... I was trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God and His different expansions, they are of same power. <span class="Italic">Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu, kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo... [Bs. </span>5.39].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He is existing with all the incarnations, <span class="Italic">rāmādi-mūrtiṣu.</span> So Rāma is not less than Kṛṣṇa, but He is incarnation. This is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Because I was trying to refer to <span class="Italic">Govindāṣṭakam,</span> Where it says, (sings) <span class="Italic">śrī kṛṣṇa rādhā āra gokuleśa gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu, jīveti amṛtamedhadevo govindaṁ dāmodaram ada vetti(?).</span> He's saying, <span class="Italic">śrī kṛṣṇa rādhā āra gokuleśa gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu.</span> That is what I was trying to see that is really... I know that say Kṛṣṇa's expansion is Mahā-Viṣṇu, but still, why do they say <span class="Italic">govardhana-nātha viṣṇu</span>? That I was trying to understand. Please don't misunderstand me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Govardhana... Every one is <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva. Viṣṇu-tattva, jīva-tattva, śakti-tattva,</span> like that. So all of them on the Viṣṇu category. That's all. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-tayā vibhāti. Viṣṇu-tayā vibhāti. Dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya dīpāyate viṣṇu-tayā vibhāti</span> [Bs. 5.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there. So Godhead is <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span> So sometimes Viṣṇu, sometimes Nārāyaṇa, sometimes Govinda, sometimes Kṛṣṇa, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That's very nice, because one can understand very well. Because I always took Mahā-Viṣṇu as the expansion of Kṛṣṇa, but still, when I went to <span class="Italic">Govindāṣṭakam</span> and then also like <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> says, <span class="Italic">yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā... [Bs. </span>5.48].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...<span class="Italic">jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ, viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya</span> (Prabhupāda quotes same verse simultaneously) <span class="Italic">kalā-viśeṣo govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.</span> So he says Mahā-Viṣṇu is even one expansion of Kṛṣṇa, yet in <span class="Italic">Govindāṣṭakam</span> they say, <span class="Italic">govardhana, gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu, śrī kṛṣṇa rādhā gokuleśa, gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're all <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva. Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma-stotra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Because many people... At least among the Indians I get very big argument about it, that it is Mahā-Viṣṇu who is Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Kṛṣṇa is only one <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> of His. And I try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That argument is discussed in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> First volume?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, first volume you see. You see. See the contents. You can't find it? When he is discussing somebody, says Viṣṇu is the origin? So children, how many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No children</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good than another. (laughs) No responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I have decided that in about five, ten years, I'll work that much only. Afterwards I'm going to go to work for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Because I don't find any more pleasures, you know, in anything. As I go on chanting and chanting and chanting, sometime, Prabhupāda... Oh, my first dream that came when I joined your movement... First dream that I came... And I told my wife about it in the morning. I said, first I saw a moon, and then I saw another large planet coming up, and then on the top of it I saw the lotus feet of the Lord. And when I saw the lotus feet of the Lord, I saw you coming on a swan and doing His <span class="Italic">pūjā.</span> And I kept on shouting to my wife that "Please see Prabhupāda is here. Please see. He is doing <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> of lotus feet of the Lord." And that was my first dream that came. Sometimes after chanting all the time I feel as if He is walking next to me. I can feel as if His bluish body is right next to me, and all the time I have a feeling that somebody is next to me, you know. I don't know whether I'm going crazy or I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is already there. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I asked, I took a poll, census poll of about six or seven GBC men, including Kīrtanānanda, Rāmeśvara, Bali-mardana, so many men who know New York, and they all thought that if you join the parade at Twenty-third Street...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-third. At what time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ah, it'll be... It should be at about 3:15, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then it will be nice. Because the whole parade is about fifty-four blocks, and you'll be riding for about nineteen blocks. It means your ride will take about forty-five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what time I'll going to start?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody will come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I think I will probably come. Kīrtanānanda will also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At what time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think, say, it's going to be either 2:45 or 3:00. Tomorrow morning I'll let you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at 3:00 I shall be ready. You can come and take me. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I think at 3:00... But then by the time we get in the car... I think it will work, 3:00 o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. 3:00 o'clock, I'll be ready. You come and take. In the meantime, I shall finish my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that will leave a little time for resting. The whole program should be over by about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So tomorrow I shall take lunch at 1:00. That's all. Then, by 3:00 o'clock, I shall be ready. (to Indian man:) (Hindi?) Kṛṣṇa is preparing you to join this movement wholeheartedly. It is very nice. Now you have got it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja quotes, <span class="Italic">ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> "All these incarnations of Godhead are either plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the <span class="Italic">puruṣa-avatāras,</span> but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself." Then he says, "The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> describes the symptoms and deeds of the incarnations in general and counts Śrī Kṛṣṇa among them. This made Sūta Gosvāmī greatly apprehensive. Therefore he distinguished each incarnation by its specific symptoms. All the incarnations of Godhead are plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the <span class="Italic">puruṣa-avatāras,</span> but the primeval Lord is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of all incarnations. An opponent may say, 'This is your interpretation, but actually the Supreme Lord is Nārāyaṇa, who is in the transcendental realm. He, Nārāyaṇa, incarnates as Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of the verse as I see it. There is no need for further consideration.' To such a misguided interpreter we may reply, 'Why should you suggest such fallacious logic? An interpretation is never accepted as evidence if it opposes the principles of scripture. One should not state a predicate before its subject, for it cannot thus stand without proper support.' If I do not state a subject, I do not state a predicate. First I speak the former and then the latter. The predicate of a sentence is what is unknown to the reader, whereas the subject is what is known to him. For example, we may say, 'This <span class="Italic">vipra</span> is a greatly learned man.' In this sentence, the <span class="Italic">vipra</span> is the subject, and the predicate is his erudition. The man's being a <span class="Italic">vipra</span> is known, but his erudition is unknown. Therefore the person is identified first and his erudition later. In the same way all these incarnations were known, but whose incarnations they are was unknown. First the word <span class="Italic">ete,</span> 'these,' establishes the subject, the incarnation. Then 'plenary portions of the <span class="Italic">puruṣa-avatāras</span>' follows as the predicate. In the same way, when Kṛṣṇa was first counted among the incarnations, specific knowledge about Him was still unknown. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> appears as the subject followed by the predicate, describing Him as the original Personality of Godhead. This establishes that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. The original Personality of Godhead is therefore necessarily Kṛṣṇa. Had Kṛṣṇa been the plenary portion and Nārāyaṇa the primeval Lord, the statement of Sūta Gosvāmī would have been reversed. Thus he would have said, 'Nārāyaṇa, the source of all incarnations, is the original Personality of Godhead. He has appeared as Śrī Kṛṣṇa.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everything is given with logic and argument. <span class="Italic">Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all He's grouped among the incarnations, but Kṛṣṇa is not incarnation.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That's where the problem in India is. Everyone is saying God is Mahā-Viṣṇu, and Kṛṣṇa and Rāma are only <span class="Italic">avatāras,</span> and that's where the big argument came in. In fact, I talked to so many...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Shall I read the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Umhm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages." Purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "As stated in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and the sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. They can neither understand His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why the Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand Kṛṣṇa. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand Kṛṣṇa by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> also it is stated clearly that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature. Or they can imagine something by mental speculation. But it is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa by such foolish speculation. Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, 'Here I am, present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.' One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand Kṛṣṇa who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position. Because most men cannot understand Kṛṣṇa in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord's uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Lord, that He is Kṛṣṇa. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God. Their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa, they can understand Kṛṣṇa. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree, 'What is <span class="Italic">ātmā</span>? What is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In my class I run into lot of arguments, especially from our Indian people, and this is one of the biggest arguments people pose. They say, "Why are you calling yourselves Vaiṣṇavas and not <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇayas</span>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If I call Kṛṣṇa, I accept Kṛṣṇa as Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the question comes to me, "Why are you calling yourself Vaiṣṇavas? Why not <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇayas</span>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That already is explained, that Kṛṣṇa or Rāma, Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, They are all <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span> Therefore Viṣṇu is the common word for everyone. Just like candle. Everyone is candle, but still, this is first candle, this is second candle, this is third candle, like that. So Godhead means all <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span> They are not <span class="Italic">jīva-tattva.</span> So therefore those who are devotee of God, they are called Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This specific Vaiṣṇava, that refers to Viṣṇu? Worshipers of Viṣṇu?</div>

Although I accept Kṛṣṇa as original Personality of Godhead, but how to explain to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, these are the references.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> In here also. Should I read the verse? "All other incarnations are potentially situated in the original body of the primeval Lord. Thus, according to one's opinion, one may address Him as any one of the incarnations." Purport: "It is not contradictory for a devotee to call the Supreme Lord by any one of the various names of His plenary expansions, because the original Personality of Godhead includes all such categories. Since the plenary expansions exist within the original person, one may call Him by any of these names. In <span class="Italic">Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata</span> Lord Caitanya says, 'I was lying asleep in the ocean of milk, but I was wakened by the call of Nāḍā, Śrī Advaita Prabhu.' Here the Lord refers to His form as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu." Translation: "Some say that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is directly Nara-Nārāyaṇa, others say that He is directly Vāmana. Some say that Kṛṣṇa is the incarnation of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. None of these statements is impossible. Each of them is as correct as the others." Purport: "<span class="Italic">Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta</span> states,</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes Mahā-Viṣṇu wanted to see Kṛṣṇa. That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, </span>and He took Arjuna with Him.</div>

And it is decided by the court that Śrīnāthajī originally belongs to Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava, by the court. This Mādhavendra Purī is the spiritual master of Īśvara Purī. And Īśvara Purī is the spiritual master of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So from Mādhavendra Purī is Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. So his Deity is Gopāla. That Gopāla is Śrīnāthajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> When I was a young boy, eight years old, I went to Śrīnāthajī with my father, mother, and there I had to take the <span class="Italic">brahma-samāna,(?)</span> which is the oath, taking of the oath in front of the Mahārāja and the priest of the Śrīnāthajī temple.

Why not Mahā-Viṣṇu sitting in <span class="Italic">samādhi</span>? Because Śivajī's position is to serve Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa is afraid of mother Yaśodā's rope. But that does not mean He is no longer the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's afraid of "Mother, don't bind Me." So everyone is afraid of Kṛṣṇa, and He is afraid of His mother's rope. So does it mean Kṛṣṇa has become no more the Supreme?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One man, he challenged that he could prove that Sai Baba is a fake. So he's written so many letters to Sai Baba to challenge him, but he's never received a reply. So that paper gave this article criticizing Sai Baba like that and other gurus, and then in the same paper there was a very nice article concerning our Jagannātha Cart Festival. So practically they were appreciating that Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is bona fide and these other people are nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Right. In fact, several people, even in our community in Poughkeepsie, received letters from Satya Sai Baba's followers that "Here is a letter. Make ten copies and send the ten copies to ten different people. If you don't, Satya Sai Baba's thunderbolt will come and strike your family, and they'll be destroyed." Now no guru ever puts a thunderbolt on his devotee, and I said, "If that is a guru, I'll stay ten thousand miles away from him, because my guru is very kind and he'll bless me." I said, "No guru should ever put a thunderbolt on his devotee."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. But this is the height of hypocrisy, to teach <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and to chant <span class="Italic">oṁ namaḥ śivāya.</span></div>
