<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am imperfect. That's all right. But I know what is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I cannot see that. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Don't laugh. Suppose you are here. You have to go to London. If you have purchased the ticket for London and if you are sure that you have got an aeroplane, so even you have not gone to reach London, but you are sure that you are going to London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. I can be sure. I understand that, that you are sure. I have no doubt about that. But how can your security...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if I have understood that my destination is London-I am going to London-then if I feel secure, that is my happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So you are completely happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because I know, "If I go to London, I will be happy." So I am going there, therefore I am happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But you're not in London yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. I have already told you. That very purchase of ticket and the understanding that you are surely going to London, that is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But then there is no searching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that? If my destination is London, why there is searching? There is no use of searching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, then why a conference with men of other religions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that conference is to consult together that London is the destination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But then you know of a destination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But the idea that you have behind your mind, is to tell other people where the destination is, not to search for it with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't say search. I have already searched out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. So then I feel myself that this is not a conference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not conference? If I have got some good news to tell you, is it not conference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swamiji, I think the objective will be... As far as you are concerned, it will be London. As far as I am concerned, it may be Paris or Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then that is not... No, that is not. Hawaii... Then we have to consider where real happiness, whether it is in Hawaii or in Paris or in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> True. But then you are not going to a country that it is not London. And if I say I am not going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on. That is going on. There are innumerable planets, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ [Bg. 9.25].</span> Now, if you think that London is not good for you, Paris is good for you, it is good for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, then the whole conference becomes useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you don't agree that which is the..., or do not understand what is the highest goal, then conference is useless. If you keep yourself to the understanding where you are, then there is no need of conference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is the same thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not exactly the same thing. That is the conference-I want to convince you that London is the real place of happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But maybe I think that I know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may think, but you'll have to be convinced that your thinking is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Or maybe I can convince you that your thinking is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Therefore conference required. (laughter) Therefore conference required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swamiji, the time is running out, however, and I would like to thank you very much for the, your coming in our center here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you are convinced that conference is required. You have to convince me; I'll have to convince you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think that it is through those confrontations and through those listenings to each other... [break] (French) man</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> If you go to London, I want to go to India, and then we shall be separated. So we must all go both to London and India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say that first of all we have to decide where to go. If anyone is satisfied that "I am satisfied with going to London or going to Paris..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But that is the question. Where should we go? If you believe you must go to London, I believe very strongly I must go to India, and I am convinced that to me India is London...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. As you are convinced that going to India is good for you, similarly, you must change your conviction also, that going to London is also nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes. But so may you also change your conviction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may... Yes, if you can convince me. Therefore conference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> If you believe that you cannot be convinced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I believe you can convince me. If we are reasonable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But then you are searching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What? No. My searching is complete. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But then I cannot convince you of anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why not? You have got reason; I have got reason. You have to show me that these are favorable condition in Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But how can I convince you? Because you are saying that you cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Convince means you have to convince me with your reasoning power or presentation. That is not very difficult thing. Two lawyers are fighting in the court. They are convincing. Now the judgement is there. So that fighting means for convincing, not only in law court, in everywhere. In assembly, in Parliament, in Senate house. That is a regular thing. Now the majority is accepting. Now this shall be... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (inaudible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Show it now. (end)</div>
