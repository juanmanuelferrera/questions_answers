<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...nobody said that this meat-eating is bad; now I am saying. You see? So they do not know that it is bad. So they are not offenders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And now that you are saying, many people are stopping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Somebody, they act... Just like illicit sex. They did not know that it is sinful. Now they are understanding. There was no good leader. Even the priests. In the Bible it is said, "Thou shalt not kill." The priests never said, because they are meat-eaters. They themselves are meat-eaters. How they can say? "It is our tradition to eat meat." But how the common man will be educated? [break] You can give me the general <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> today. I will taste. (test?) [break] When one becomes rich, he becomes lazy. What is called? "Leads to poverty"? Luxury. "Luxury leads to poverty." So at one time one become very rich by hard work, and next generation gets the money for nothing, he spends it on luxuries, and the third generation, poor. There are many families, in everywhere. In England, all these English men, in the beginning they worked very hard, expanding their empire and working. Then gradually, when they became Lord family, then luxury. Now they are poverty-stricken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their country is very poor now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of Europe is poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Especially Holland and England. Holland and England and France, there was competition for colonization. The same colonization is there in America, Canada. The Frenchmen and-what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Dutchmen, they went to New York first. The Dutch, they first went to New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Peter Stuyvesant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> The Scandinavian countries are not so poor. Denmark, Sweden...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are industrious, and they have got resources.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And they have developed more recently, I think. They were not colonizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the colonizing propaganda was amongst these three nation. France, English...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Spanish and Portuguese. Spanish also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that side, is, means Western side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Spanish went to South America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But the British used to say, "The sun never sets in the British empire."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we knew in our childhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Now there's no empire for the sun to set on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Now they have made it Commonwealth, keeping some scent, flavor of British empire. Commonwealth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda? In those early days of colonization they were trying to sail to India by a quick route to get the spices, and it was the same time that Lord Caitanya's movement began. So is that just a coincidence, that they were trying to go to India at the same time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What it has got with Caitanya's movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I heard... A devotee once told me that they were actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, again, "heard it from devotee." (laughter) That is very dangerous. What Caitanya's movement has got with politics? Nothing. They drag Caitanya's movement, that. Many rascals do that. It has nothing to do with politics. It is simply spiritual. Rather, even the Mohammedans, they were very much respectful to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They never took it as, His, the political movement. Now it has become a fashion to take everything from political point of view. Just like in India, they are suspecting you as CIA. "CIA has come to become Vaiṣṇava." (laughter) [break] That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu says. If anyone remembers Kṛṣṇa by seeing somebody, that somebody is a Vaiṣṇava. He gives impetus to remember Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he is Vaiṣṇava. You stick to your principle, Vaiṣṇava. Then <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not touch. [break] Where is Prajāpati? He is not here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He's here in Vṛndāvana, but he hasn't come on the walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, he is going to demonstrate anything? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Is he going to do any play?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dances?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is your desire for that, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I told him that you make some play for showing here in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's all right that the women are dancing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You said plays. He could do plays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Women as far as possible should be no... That's not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He spoke to me about it. He wants to do four performances here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that dancing he wants to do or plays?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With women?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He has to do play?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So without woman there is no dancing? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His whole troupe is women. The New York devotees, the Vaikuṇṭha Players, they have drama group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, drama is good. Woman dancing will not be very much appreciated here. [break] ...scarcity of grains and government will exact taxes for poor-feeding, and it will be used for their own purpose. These are the <span class="Italic">Kali</span> symptoms. [break] ...stay in future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Are they doubting for themselves or for us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They should doubt for themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from that, now, from logical point of view...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Our movement, this movement, is Kṛṣṇa's own movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that they may not... I mean to say, from mundane argument, we are selling these twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of worth books monthly, so it is being spread all over the world. And those who are purchasing books, they are intelligent men. Then when they will read, how this movement will stop?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It will never stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will not stop. The books distribution is so important, that it will continue to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They doubt that our devotees will stick many times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. We will create by distributing books new devotees. These devotee may be... But others will be created. And we are creating a new generation for becoming devotee at Dallas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? One thing in your lecture you sometimes say that we spend ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> a month just for maintaining. But I figured out we spend... You can say even fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> because ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> is very conservative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, so far I have heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I... From what I have seen we spend...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> is just three or four temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Los Angeles, New York, maybe Toronto, San Francisco, Dallas, that's all. Ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> right there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the actual expenditure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, it must be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Four times that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> At least fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> each month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how you are getting money? If you are selling only twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth books, how you are spending forty <span class="Italic">lakhs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are selling more books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> More than twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give me, what is called, consensus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The idea is the Book Fund, if the book is sold, it's sold at a profit. So although you may be getting only twenty or thirty <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> much more is being collected. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why did you not correct me in the meeting? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I didn't... (laughter) Even ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> is a very impressive figure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> expenditure but twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> collection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I think now we should say fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> expenditure and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One crore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One crore collection. That will be a nice target. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...getting more price for their land on account of the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda Mahārāja, they are just started asking double.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But who is going to purchase it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Ah, we are not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The purchaser is ourself only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about that land...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...not very nice last time. But this time also I am not eating, but I am working nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is improvement, no eating but working nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like the six Gosvāmīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that will be great fortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will save your expenditure, and you will get your work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the devotees of Lord Caitanya, they liked to see Him take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> We don't... We're not that interested to save.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra, janma sārthaka kari</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> "First of all, you become perfect." If you are a devil, you cannot do it. The devil and divine. Divine means spiritually advanced, and devil means materially advanced. And because we are manufacturing divine, the devils are afraid of it. The devils do not like this movement. (Someone drives by:) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So just see, automatically they are offering respect. That means we are infecting them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was noticing that yesterday on the parade, everyone was offering respects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Vṛndāvana after all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that is a benefit spiritually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To offer you respects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In Bombay, even those poor fisherwomen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are offering respects. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So we have to create divine because the world is full of devils.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we have to be divine ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless you become divine, how you can convert others to divine? If you are devil, you will convert others to become devil, that's all. [break] ...most beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span>. Presided over by Aryama, the planet of trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Planet... not planet. Amongst the trees. So who will prepare nice foodstuff for the governor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda Mahārāja, very nice <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is preparing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We've given the list to the chief cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> My wife is there and then Pālikā, Devaśakti, your sister. Everybody is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Do it very nicely. Now it will be examined who can cook very nice. If they say, "Oh, it is very nice," then good certificate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Prabhupāda, everybody is praising <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Everybody praising. Now the governor should praise. Then it will be praising. We can praise ourself, mutual praising society. You are very good, and you say I am very good, that's all. "Mr. Such and such is very good," and another man says, "Mr. Such and such very good." That is mutual praising society. Others must praise. Outsider must praise. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...question about the philosophy? It's about the expansions. We've been reading the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> about Nityānanda Rāma, about the expansions of Lord Nityānanda, Saṅkarṣaṇa. And we were having a little difficulty trying to understand exactly the order in which He expands Himself. We understand that Kṛṣṇa expands as Balarāma. And then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then again Balarāma expands as Saṅkarṣaṇa. And Saṅkarṣaṇa expands. In this way expansion goes on. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mention two Saṅkarṣaṇas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hundred thousand Saṅkarṣaṇa. Do you mean to say that this universal management is so easy thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot manage a small temple. (laughter) And Kṛṣṇa has to manage such a vast universal affairs. So this requires brain and expansion. You, when you are enquired, asked, "Why it is not done?" "I told him. I told him." He says, "I told him." Kṛṣṇa does not say. He expands immediately and does the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hmm, does it Himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa, not that "I told him, and he did not do. I am free. That's all." (laughs) Expansion of order, and nobody is doing-not like that. One has to see whether it is done. That is Kṛṣṇa. Not that I have told the another man and sleep myself. And Kṛṣṇa does everything in such a way perfect. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam idam [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span> Nobody can find out any defect. That is Kṛṣṇa, all-perfect. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...in the Vaikuṇṭhas, surrounding Nārāyaṇa is Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So five are present. Pañca-tattva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, you say that Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">pūrṇam,</span> the complete whole. So in the material world, if something is very great, even though we may not like it, like people may not like the United States, but still, they have to admit that it is a very great country in comparison to theirs. So in the material world, things which are great, at least we have to admit that to some extent they are great. But Kṛṣṇa is everything. So how is it that people are saying that He's so tiny that He may even be an ordinary man? How can they be so illusioned to think like that? Kṛṣṇa is everything. How can they ignore Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Illusioned because you do not know what Kṛṣṇa says. That is your fault. Kṛṣṇa says, "You do this," but you do not do that. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> Who is doing that? Just take a census, who is thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Hardly you will find one in million. So who is carrying out the order of Kṛṣṇa? Nobody is doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are. But Śrīla Prabhupāda, how is it that Kṛṣṇa is everything, completely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And still, people completely can ignore Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Because Kṛṣṇa is everything, his independence is also Kṛṣṇa. The man's independence is also Kṛṣṇa. So he is misusing his independence. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is using his independence not to do this. Therefore he is suffering. (Greeting someone:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</span> [Bg. 15.15] "From Me there is remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." So why Kṛṣṇa is interested to induce one to forget? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because they want to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That independence. So he wants to forget. Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, you do at your risk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And suffer the consequences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it the spirit soul which is desiring or is it just <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The desiring... After desiring, there is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> First of all willing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thinking, feeling, willing. What you think, you feel, and then you will, and Kṛṣṇa sanctions, that "Do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is the thinking material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material and spiritual also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passer-by:</span> <span class="Italic">Hari bol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just like this machine can be used for material and spiritual purpose. When it is being used for spiritual, it is spiritual. Otherwise, material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it can be used in either way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Either way, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So our thinking and our feeling and our willing is the same. It can be either used in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But some energy of Kṛṣṇa's cannot be used either way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Everything can be used. What is the example, it cannot be used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I was thinking of Kṛṣṇa's internal energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, internal energy, when it is perverted, that is material energy, when it is covered. Just like the sun. When it is covered, it is called cloud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was thinking of just like Kṛṣṇa's pure devotees like mother Yaśodā. They are always eternally remaining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...strongly warm, then you do not become cool very soon. You must be strongly warm, fire temperature. Then you will act as fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the process for heating up the fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You keep yourself with fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> That is you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't go outside the fire. Then you keep yourself warm. And temperature increase exactly like fire. That is required. That is the motto of our <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead:</span> "Godhead is light, nescience is darkness. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience." That is the beginning of our movement. Keep Kṛṣṇa always. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you remain Kṛṣṇized. And as soon as you give it up, then think of devils. This is going on. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">...kīrtana</span> going twenty-four hours a day. In some of our larger temples is it also advisable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. This is advisable for everywhere. Batches. What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because the whole atmosphere becomes spiritualized, purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same thing: keep always with fire and you remain high temperature. And if you ignite fire and again pour water and again ignite, again pour, then what is the benefit? If you ignite fire, keep it fire, don't pour water. But generally they do that, that "Now I am chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, I am free from all sinful activities. Now again let me do it, and again I shall chant."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No progress. <span class="Italic">Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.</span> This is the greatest offense. [break] (switches to room conversation) ...the animals and human beings. Then they can work. <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni,</span> then <span class="Italic">parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> Now <span class="Italic">parjanyaḥ,</span> cloud and rain, that is required. <span class="Italic">Parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> And <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you have to arrange for sacrifice. So in the Kali-yuga the costly sacrifice is not possible. Therefore from the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> we understand, <span class="Italic">yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">. Sumedhasaḥ,</span> "one who has got good brain substance." There is one word in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, alpa-medhasaḥ:</span> "poor brain substance." So we require some <span class="Italic">sumedhasaḥ,</span> not <span class="Italic">alpa-medhasaḥ. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasaḥ [Bg. </span>7.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are making plans by their material concoction that... That is <span class="Italic">antavat.</span> That will be finished. <span class="Italic">Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasaḥ.</span> The things are there already, especially in India. We have got everything ready, and especially this land India. It is specially meant for God realization. By the birth, one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, or God conscious. Still in these days, whenever... You have seen in Hyderabad. Although your conference was going on, still, at least five thousand men were attracted to hear me. (Guest laughs) And I was speaking the dry subject of Kṛṣṇa. So India is so fortunate. They are still ready to assimilate the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. The land is so fortunate. So we must give them the chance. That is our duty. That is government's duty. That is teacher's duty. That is father's duty. That is explained in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata. Pitā na sa syāt.</span> Guru's duty. One who has got the chance of accepting something very easily... The guardians... The first guardian, the government, the second, the father, then the teacher, then so many, friends, relatives-that chance should be given. So Nandaji is thinking... He is an experienced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Actually, Kṛṣṇa Raya (?) has performed there. Nandaji had taken that troupe there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is also a big man. Now he is retired from politics?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. He is very much... He is more in politics than myself. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, on that point I have taken his ideas very nice, his thinking. He is a good thinker. And so I have taken his ideas, and I want to reply him. So any good thinker, leaders, they should do something so the India's glories... Now, these people, they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is India's glory because we haven't got to give them anything. We are hundred years back always. When they manufacture jet plane, we manufacture sewing machine. Or cycle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But we have great <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can give them these things. We can give them these things, that spiritual emancipation, and they are appreciating. So if we make ourself in India a nice program-already they are eager to take-then they will take more and more. And that will glorify India's prestige. So everything is ready there? Oh, here. You have got that letter. You can... (end)</div>
