<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not dangerously atheistic. Atheism they have spread. "There is no God-science." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...possible to be a scientist and also be God conscious. Why not use science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real scientist. These are false scientists.</div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Actually the Supreme Lord is the source of everything. So if one is actually scientist, by his scientific explanation he will point out, "Here is the cause of all causes." By scientific knowledge he will point out that God is the origin of everything. Then his scientific study is perfect. But these rascals, they are doing the opposite, that "There is no need of God. Science is everything," although it is imperfect. That is their fault. Therefore they are rogues. They cannot prove; still, they will insist, "Yes, we shall do. We are trying," like that, and misleading people. General people, they are rascal and fools. If you mislead them, they will be misled. <span class="Italic">Śūdra, mūḍhas.</span> They are to be educated. Instead of educating them, they are making them more and more fools and rascals. [break] There is utility, but they have no utility. There is some service; they carry some passengers. They are carried nowhere. Simply they mislead. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> ...lization, they feel that they need science. They've become dependent upon science. They feel that without science they cannot live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The scientists have made them dependent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. These rascals are fools. Therefore they have become dependent. Why science? What for? That is not... Science is required, <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> That is nice. But they are not scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We ask them if they need eternal life. They say "No, we don't need that. We need comforts."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... We are eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> That "We need our daily bread," like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is comfort? You are going to die. Where is your comfort? You are going to be diseased. You are going to be old man like me. Every moment there is some trouble. So where is the comfort, rascal? That means misleading. There is no comfort; still, they are promising comfort. This is misleading. Where is comfort? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is no comfort.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Where is comfort? If you have to die-"Oh, I am dying comfortably"-what is this nonsense? "I am dying comfortably."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee man (1):</span> Like yesterday night, that man. I asked him, (Hindi) So he said that "I am all right." But he was unable to sit on the chair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> To the park, straight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Comfort, where is your comfort? Why you have so many medical men if you are comfortable? Why there are so many drugs, medicine, if you are comfortable? This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He is not in comfort; still, he will say that "I am in comfort." This is called <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So these drugs, even though one may be feeling pain, he can take the drugs and he won't feel pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He will take injection. It is comfort. Daily he will take injection, and it is comfort. (laughter) Just see the fools and rascals. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> [break] ...met so many medical men, doctors and quack. "Die comfortably." What is the use of this medical man, medicine? What is the use? If your comfort and death is comfortable, then why spend so much money? Die comfortably. Because you cannot check death, then why you are trying to check death? "Let me live some years more. Let me take this medicine." Why? Why this struggle? Die comfortably. Suffer disease comfortably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They've made so much propaganda that life is meant to enjoy. Everywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Enjoy, but where is your enjoyment? Come to the practical point. Where is your enjoyment? You are simply suffering. That is their rascaldom. They are suffering; still, they say, "I am enjoying." This is called illusion, <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Enjoy. That we also say, that we are trying to take you to a certain place, kingdom of God or back..., where you will enjoy. Enjoy... <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> That enjoy is our aim. But where is your enjoyment here? That is your rascaldom. There is no enjoyment; still, you say, "We shall enjoy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Their propaganda leads people to think that they can enjoy... That it's possible here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're misleading. That is misleading. We have to check that. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness move..., that... They are not enjoying, and these rascals misleading them that they are enjoying. [break] Enjoyment is our aim also-but real enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Ramante yogino 'nante satyānande. Satyānanda.</span> Not this <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> temporary <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Satyānanda-cid-ātmani.</span> Yogis, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogis,</span> they also want <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> but not this false <span class="Italic">ānanda, satyānanda-cid-ātmāni, iti...</span> Therefore they call <span class="Italic">Rāma. Rāma</span> means <span class="Italic">ramaṇa,</span> enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Iti rāma-padenāsau paraṁ brahmābhidhiyate</span> [Cc. Madhya 9.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">satyānanda.</span> They do not understand, as soon as we accept this material body, it is misery, simply misery. The body is constructed within the womb of the mother in a miserable condition. These rascals, they do not understand. In a packed-up way, head down, leg up. And it is enjoyment. The body is created in this troublesome, from miserable condition; still, they say, "enjoyment." This is foolishness. This is called illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Sigmund Freud, his philosophy is that that position in the womb was one of great security, and we all want to go back to that position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is security? The mother is killing them, abortion. Where is security? The mother, under whose abdomen I have taken shelter, she is killing. Where is security?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> One <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājī</span> in Nairobi, he was saying that the body is only made in three months, not in seven months in the abdomen of a mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> He said the body only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body is made in one night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> He said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he said. What he is? Body is made, one night, immediately. After sex it becomes emulsified, two secretion, and immediately a pealike form is there. That is body. And that grows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Although everyone is suffering, however, they think that "Because I am not suffering, everyone else is suffering, and that's okay." They're thinking that the miseries are only for others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another ignorance. Everyone is dying. He is thinking, "I will not die." This is ignorance. He is running so fast unnecessarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> He is trying to enjoy that machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Enjoy means another machine will strike, and his enjoyment will stop. There is ship, going fast. Where he will go fast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Around the island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the dog. He goes fast here and there. <span class="Italic">"Gow! Gow!"</span> (laughter) It is like that. He is going fast. Doggish mentality. That's all, all dogs and cats, no human being. This civilization means they are creating only dogs and cats, animals, <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ,</span> cows and asses. They are... We don't take them as human being. All animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that because they don't acknowledge that they're suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things. So many things. The first ignorance is that accepting this body as self. Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The capitalists are so anxious for money that they exploit this tendency of the living entity to enjoy by tempting him. Every year they create some new way to entice him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And taxation. And the taxation is divided among them. The tax is meant for public welfare. Instead of public welfare, they divide it amongst themselves and enjoy wine, women, motorcar and flesh. That's all. This is going on. All this income tax-plundering process. This income tax means a plan how to take away everything from the actually earning members of the society. That is income tax. And that is divided amongst administrators. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Here it is very prominent. The workers in the fields, they are barely making enough to live from day to day. But the planters who live in France, they are taking millions of rupees and living very comfortably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Communism is coming. Go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Is it this way? We can go this way. This way. Or better this way. Now he's coming the other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...create another danger. Just like airplane. It is comfortable. You can quickly go from one place to another. But as soon as on the plane, immediately your life is at risk. There is no certainty. So this is the way of material world. You create some comfort and you create some greater danger also. Side by side. It cannot be unhampered comfort. That is not possible. You create a motorcar-the same thing-you drive very speedy and you meet accident. Railway, the accident. There was no need. You produce your food locally and produce your milk. Then eat, drink, and live comfortably. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. Make your life successful. <span class="Italic">Yad uttama-śloka-guṇānuvarṇanam</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> And if you have got education, then describe the glories of the Lord by your scientific and educational qualification. [break] The rain is coming. We can go this way. <span class="Italic">Yad uttama-śloka-guṇānuvarṇanam</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> there are so many things that were... about the world that were mistakes, and then, by their scientific knowledge, they found the real fact. Like they say the earth was flat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bible</span> may be wrong, but we are talking generally. So if you are scientist, you can say the right thing. But why should you deny God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, if the book of God has made mistake, then we don't have any faith...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Book of God... Then throw it. Kick it out. But I say that you are scientist. How you can deny God? That is our propaganda. The so-called book of God, you throw away. But you are scientist. How can you deny the existence of God? Why you are misleading? <span class="Italic">Bible</span> misleading, that's all right. Why you are misleading? That is our point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> For so many centuries they took the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> to be the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, throw it away. You are scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They won't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are a scientist. How you can deny God? Then what kind of scientist you are? The <span class="Italic">Bible</span> has done wrong. Throw it away. I have no objection. But you are scientist. How you can deny God? And that is our point. Come to this logic, that "How we can deny God?" You are speaking that from chemical combination life is formed. Do it in the laboratory. You cannot do it. Why you are propagating false propaganda? What kind of scientist? Then you are also to be kicked out. If <span class="Italic">Bible</span> is to be kicked out you are also to be kicked out. Why you are claiming your position? You prove first of all. You combine chemical and produce a life. And you are making false propaganda, so you are to be kicked out. They say, "We shall do in future." And what is the future? Then why you are at present making false propaganda. Wait for the future. Post-dated check. "In future I shall pay." Who will accept this check? Any nonsense will accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But this world is so imperfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The world is not imperfect; you are imperfect rascal. You are rascal; you are imperfect. World is not imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, they have these cyclones. They come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Must come because you are to be killed. You are rascal; you are to be killed. Therefore God has created cyclone. You protect yourself if you are scientist, if you have got power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Because they are anxious for some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because God has created cyclone, therefore He is perfect because you are to be killed, blown away with your all paraphernalia, with your all scientific laboratory and instrument. Go. Go to hell. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They are eager to find a solution. Therefore they are forced to speculate because they have no other way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They have no other way to learn, unless they will accept <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> which they won't accept. [break] ...sense gratification. They enjoy making so many theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. <span class="Italic">Mano-ratha:</span> "Chariot of mind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ.</span> By his chariot of the mind he will be driven to this material consciousness. [break] ...spiritual knowledge. Therefore, we see, big, big scientists, they are thinking that combination of matter can produce life. In spite of so much advanced learning, they do not know what is life. They cannot create life; still, they will theorize. How foolish they are. And as soon as you catch his throat, "Produce life." "No, we shall do it in future." Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes people ask that "If God is so great, then why doesn't He just come and destroy all the evil?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you have to suffer. You are rascal. You must suffer. Therefore evil must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why doesn't He force us to be good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if the criminals and thieves say, "Why government has created this prisonhouse?" Is it very good argument? It is for you, rascal. You are criminal. You must suffer. Why it is to be abolished? Otherwise who will suffer? It is for your suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why are we evil? Why doesn't God makes us good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why are we evil?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God says that "You become devotee of Me." You do not become. That is your fault. Therefore you must... Just like government does not say that you become criminal. Government says, "You become educated. You become high-court judge, become big officer." Why you become criminal, pickpocket? Does government give any education for becoming pickpocket? Hm? Is there any institution how to steal, how to become pickpocket? (laughter) Then why do you become? Just see. [break] ...eatables you can collect, and I shall show you how to cook in the cooker. One boy. You also see, because nobody will go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Harikeśa is getting his visa today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can return. [break] Whole educational system is defective because there is no spiritual education. That has made everything impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One young boy in Johannesburg wanted to join us. He is sixteen years old. So his headmaster said, "What you will do without an education?" They think that this is the greatest ignorance. These are the leaders of education, the headmaster. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...spiritual education, he remains an animal. That's all. [break] That is <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> To find out the ultimate goal, that is education. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> "Wherefrom everything is coming," that is education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they may say, "That is not practical, because we will starve to death with such knowledge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... Then you are useless. Because you cannot go to the ultimate point of education, therefore your education is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But then they will ask, "You will come and bring me food?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I will give you food. Food is there. You are not creating food. It is... From the earth it is grown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But we have to work very hard; otherwise we won't get money for buying food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You work a very slight three months in a year and get all food. Food is there; milk is there; land is there. You have to work.</div>

But where is that knowledge? No school, no college, teaches this thing. So they remain in ignorance. What is this education if he remains in ignorance? [break] ...kinds of advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> That is their propaganda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was no... We don't require all these things because we know others are victims. They pay for it.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They have to be taught how to live by the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They feel protected with the mother. Safe. People sometimes argue that God is for less intelligent, weak persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> People who can't protect themselves, for people who cannot protect themselves, then they can have belief...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you can protect from death? Can you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But can God protect? Even Jesus Christ, he was killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We are faulty. But you are so advanced. Do you protect yourself from death? We are faulty. That is your decision. That we admit. But what is your position? Protect yourself from death. At any moment death can take place. How you'll protect yourself? Therefore we take protection of God. That "God, You can kill me at any moment. You can save me also." Therefore we are intelligent. But you cannot protect from the onslaught of God. We admit God is great, but you do not, although you will not be protected. You cannot protect yourself from birth, death, old age and disease. So what is the meaning of your protection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So both the devotee and the nondevotee, they are both in the same position. They both...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... And the devotees know that we are under the control of the Supreme, but you do not know. You are cats and dogs, and the dogs do not know, the cats do not know, you do not know. Therefore you are no better than the cats and dogs. And we know that there is God; there is controller. Therefore we are not cats and dogs. We are equal to the cats and dogs. You do not know; therefore you remain cats and dogs. We know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> What is the harm of being a cat or a dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is later on. First of all you do not know; we know. That is the difference. If somebody knows there is government, he is better than the outlaws who don't, doesn't care for the government. He is better position, a good citizen. Who accepts that there is government is good citizen. And one who doesn't care for the government, does whimsically everything, he becomes criminal. And then he is punished. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So if we all became devotees there would be no punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He'll be protected. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You've given the example that the rat in the mouth of the cat and the kitten in the mouth of the cat is two different things. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> From the hills, from these mountains. There are lakes and reservoirs and it comes down. There's a lot of rainfall on certain parts of the island all year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were speaking of <span class="Italic">anarthas</span> and one of the lesser age boys was wondering... He's asking why we shouldn't take tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because intoxication. You become addicted. You are asking because you cannot give up tea. Therefore you are asking. Therefore it should be given up. You become servant of tea. Otherwise there is no question of asking. His asking means you want to drink. That means he has become servant of tea. Our original position-we are servant of God. So we are going to be servant of God. So if we remain servant of this material world, we cannot become servant of God. [break] ...unnecessary are advertised and people become victimized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> We are putting our posters here all round and they down immediately. Simply they want advertisement of this. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...because they are envious. When they advertise all kinds of nonsense they don't mind getting cheated. But something nice, they are envious of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Accha bole tomare lagdha, suta jagat murare.</span>(?) You give me that <span class="Italic">chewra</span> and milk and banana, nothing else. [break] ...and so much useless labor for growing tea, that will be stopped. You can grow food. [break] You drink tea, you'll require sugar. Then unnecessarily producing so much sugarcane. And the by-product of sugarcane, molasses, you'll have to utilize. Then produce wine, liquor. One after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But our country depends upon sugar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is mistake. Your country, you can produce your own food. That's all. Why you should depend? You produce food grains. You produce milk. Then your all necessities is supplied. Why should you produce unnecessarily?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Here they use powdered milk because they have no cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. And here even by this sugarcane, what is called? Upper part? This part?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We call it <span class="Italic">ag.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ag,</span> yes. You can maintain thousand of cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But that's actually best food, you know. In Punjab they use that. They store it for a year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not know how to be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Even this land, here they are producing sugarcane. So that is strong for wheat. They can grow plenty of wheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Everything can be grown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> If sugarcane will grow, anything will grow. It's very fertile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Because they don't want to do anything, they simply plant the sugarcane and then they want rest for few months, simply getting money and taking and drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No work. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...getting rice, wheat from outside, they can charge any price because the price of grain is increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Any time, they can stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can stop it. (end)</div>
