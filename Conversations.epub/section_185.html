<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So only you have got only <i class="calibre3">mṛdaṅga?</i> Why?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think more are coming from Calcutta. Śyāmasundara called me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least four <i class="calibre3">khols</i> you want to have. Four <i class="calibre3">khols</i> and sixteen men, that is party. Yes. And one leading singer and one dancer. That makes complete party. Twenty, twenty-two men. So where is Śyāmasundara?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I didn't find him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I didn't find him anywhere.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not here? Huh? Resting? (background discussion among devotees) He went to bed very late last night?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He was trying to finish the Māyāpur thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, oh, that's all right. Let him remain. So you can speak some discussion from our books? You can see he is very great speaker, Viṣala prabhu.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Viṣala:</span> Me?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Viṣala:</span> I cannot speak. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Viṣala:</span> I've been reading the <i class="calibre3">Brahma-saṁhitā</i>, and uh, by His Divine Grace Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, and he mentions that to receive the mercy of..., Kṛṣṇa's mercy, one has to be free of all mundane desires, and also he has to receive the grace of God at the same time. So it's all, it's like the son, he mentions. He doesn't know how wealthy his father is, but by the grace of his father, he says, "My dear son, I have a lot of money and I..., you will be in my will, and you will have this all and I will give you all these instructions.'' So similarly, by finally gradually becoming free of all mundane desires and completely being influenced by the <i class="calibre3">cit</i> potency, by the superior cognitive energy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one will receive the mercy of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. But the most important thing is to receive the mercy of the spiritual master, because only by the guru's mercy can one be blessed by God. So that means we have... [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's been reading your <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> every morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We've been reading Śrīla..., <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, read.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I get a copy of that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So here is microphone. You did not know? Śrīmatī has brought two microphones.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yours?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's tapes also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Some tapes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. Yes. Whenever somebody comes from there, something must be brought, because these things are not available. [break] ...Indian, you cannot excel in mechanical knowledge the Europeans, American. That is not possible. We will always remain hundred years back. Everyone has got some special talent given by God. We should cooperate. That's it. The hand can work in this way. We cannot walk with hands. That is the business of the hand. Similarly, I cannot cut the papers with leg. So all living entities are endowed with special... We should cooperate. The hand and leg should cooperate for maintaining the whole body. Similarly, everyone should use his talent for satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection. Not compete with one another. That is mistake.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> (unwrapping package) It's not the microphone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I don't think it's the microphone. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They never reply.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's such a big company, they...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know what kind of big company, and their publication we do not get in India. Why? (indistinct) We cannot get in Macmillan Company. Sometimes somebody inquires, the reply, "They..., we have not published this book, this, here.'' They have no information.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We can show that one copy of that letter, and what can they do to us?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If they try to stop us from printing, we can show them the copy of that letter that says they do not publish, and then what can they do? We have a copy of...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think we can publish all books here, because the agreement is made in USA. They have nothing to do within India. Indian law is different.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think it's a world copyright, or else we could publish in Japan also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think this is a world copyright, or else we would be able to publish in Japan, in...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Japan is out of world?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's out of U.S.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's out of the U.S.A.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Like India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think their copyright...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...is binding around the world.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they want to publish, let them publish.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I offered them, that "We are going to publish." So there was no reply.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not comment and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You already offered.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hum?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should we go chant our rounds now?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] But one thing is that all right, he can go as my relative, because as visitor if he goes, then he cannot be admitted in school.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he goes as my unmarried grandson...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he can get. So that will be done. (Hindi) So your sons are very good sons. I have got all blessings for them. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi) You have so many grandsons, but I am the one erratic son, bad son.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) What is that problem?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Material problems. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) I never told you that you give up your family life, but in family life you just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi conversation) There, there is a similar case in Lord Caitanya's time. The son became first a great devotee. So when the father came, then Caitanya Mahāprabhu, (indistinct). Then father said, "No. He is my father.'' (laughs) So (Hindi conversation) Political economics and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Indian literature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian Literature. That's nice. So their work is proposed to...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think he should go there to study something, earn some money. That's all. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tridhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Bhauma ijya-dhīḥ</i>. These are nationality, <i class="calibre3">ye bhauma ijya-dhīḥ</i>, the conception of worshiping the land, <i class="calibre3">bhauma</i>. <i class="calibre3">Bhauma</i> means land, <i class="calibre3">bhūmi</i>. <i class="calibre3">Ijya</i>, <i class="calibre3">ijya</i> means worshipable. So one who thinks that <i class="calibre3">bhauma</i>, <i class="calibre3">bhūmi</i>, anything made of <i class="calibre3">bhūmi</i>, earth, worshipable...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I don't call it worshipable, Prabhupāda, but I have, I have more (indistinct) with this name, because...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) This is all illusion. This <i class="calibre3">jananī janma bhūmi</i>, huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm going for Guru dasa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Accha</i>. This <i class="calibre3">ijya-dhīḥ</i>, to worship the land of birth, but <i class="calibre3">bhārata-bhūmi</i> has special, it is <i class="calibre3">pūjā</i>...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is my contention.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not, not as nationality.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Not as nationality. There are more...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the land where Lord Kṛṣṇa came, Lord Rāma came, Lord Caitanya came, that land is certainly worshipable. That is another thing. In that way...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In that way I was saying that we talk more of spiritualism here. I don't know whether they talk it in other countries or not. But we do here more.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Other countries all they have got high respect for India as spiritual land. But we are killing, our present government and so-called leaders, killing that state. This is regrettable. They could hold this <i class="calibre3">Bhārata-varṣa</i> to the topmost summit all over the India if after independence they would have organizedly preached <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> and the Vedic culture. That is my mission. Now whatever you may think of <i class="calibre3">Bhārata-varṣa</i>, outside, India is known as a poor, poorest country, because our ministers go there to beg.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Prabhupāda, you have said that, really, what I read this morning, that if (indistinct) comes, we have to fight. Did you say to the people...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They asked me; I said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's what we want to hear now, you know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these messages are very nice?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> What did you say to them, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the language?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> When the war comes, Kṛṣṇa also said, asked Arjuna to fight.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If it's a just war, you have to fight.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So that if it's a just war we are going to fight. And the war is coming, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that's all right. Why should we be afraid of fighting?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We are not afraid!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We never... The <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> never says that when enemy attacks, you become nonviolent. No, no. Never. Rather, Gandhi said that "Yes, I shall...'' Somebody asked Gandhi that "If in your presence your wife or your daughter is ravaged, what you will do?'' That question was there, actually. But he said that "I say nonviolence upon..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, no, no. Another part. Then he said, "I'll hit him back.'' On that condition. He said, "If that comes all right, hit him back."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He said, "If a <i class="calibre3">duṣṭa</i> does that to you, you hit her back."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our policy. Our <i class="calibre3">ātatāyinaḥ</i>, the <i class="calibre3">śastra ātatāyinaḥ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Ātatāyinaḥ</i> means a person who usurps my property.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> A tyrant.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> A tyrant, <i class="calibre3">ātatāyinaḥ</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aggressor, aggressor.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Aggressor.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <i class="calibre3">Ātatāyinaḥ.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who sets fire in my home and who wants to kill me, they're called <i class="calibre3">ātatāyinaḥ</i>. So they should be immediately killed. There's no question of nonviolent. And if the Vaiṣṇava is insulted, he should be killed immediately. That is also, Caitanya Mahāprabhu who advised that we should be humbler than the grass, but practically when Nityānanda Prabhu was insulted, He immediately wanted to kill Jagāi and Mādhāi. So these messages...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> This has touched people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, ha.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This is what they're worried about. Did you know last time there were these signals practicing black-out and all that sort of thing? So now whole country is full of it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Rāmacandra's father, Daśaratha Maharaja, about him it is written, <i class="calibre3">samūla vartham nava dhṛt ariṁśca(?)</i>. There are many qualifications. Out of that, one qualification was <i class="calibre3">samula avartham nava dhṛt hariṁś ca.(?)</i> Enemy will come, then he will uproot the whole generation. <i class="calibre3">Samula vartham nava dhṛt hariṁś ca(?).</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> After the festival, Prabhupāda, are you going to <i class="calibre3">Vṛndāvana</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am thinking of. I have not gone for many years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Your room is very well kept there. I have been to that place myself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We have seen that your room is kept well.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Guru dasa is keeping? So I can go and live in my room. The difficulty is that whenever I go, at least another half-a-dozen or dozen will go.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The entourage.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) So what shall I do? Therefore, otherwise I liked Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We can find a place for them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We can just go and arrange it if you allow us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We go while the festival is on. We can arrange for your place for you and for devotees...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...to stay. I can do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I'm going a couple of days earlier anyway.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. So (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Rohita.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Rohita.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rohita, yes, I remember.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rohita. Rohita was the son of...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hariścandra.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hariścandra, yes. And daughters?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Daughters they will be bringing with them this evening also, the two daughters.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So how old they are?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One is about seventeen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One I think ten years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yesterday the two younger ones came. Of the two elder ones, we'll bring this evening. They are eighteen..., seventeen and eighteen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One is studying to be...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are trying to find out some groom? Not yet.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Not yet. I have not done anything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think you can get them married if you find out good boy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Working.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good health and working. Never mind rich or poor.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should see that he is good health and working. That's all. Not idle. So in your community I... (end)</div>
