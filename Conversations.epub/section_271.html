<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But if an animal kills, he gives for food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Another one, Guru Maharajaji, they are taking our picture and selling all Christian books as religion education, moral education. And this is the tools. These people little cunning, eh? When it comes to my knowledge, I was almost...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. And they are selling all these Christian books in the schools and all over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherever. This is our advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Advertisement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demonstration of world religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> World religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is world religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But what inside... (showing pamphlet or something) They say religion and moral education books, and all this... So actually, they should take our permission also. So this will sell our books. Our organization, not theirs, controlling the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Religious people are recognizing that this is very important. They say "the world religion," and this is the tool. They say, well, the tool. "Here is the new tool for religion education in the secondary schools." So they are recognizing this fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without canvassing, people join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This is the fact here, see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the world religion... The Ratha-yātrā, we did not ask any particular man. Everyone came and joined. You were there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I was not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone came and joined. Everyone took <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And they were in Trafalgar Square from five to eight, continually. And Guardian published that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Several pictures...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Rival to Nelson." Our Ratha-yātrā is rival to Nelson. Actually world religion. There is no doubt about it. Kṛṣṇa is for everyone. And we have no restriction. They, so long they, our so-called Hindus, they restricted. But now this is open. (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think the article they got in a straight weekly mag... (indistinct) envy our national character. You know, there's envy, a lot of envy. If you are successful, or somebody is successful, everybody becomes jealous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that we explain every day. This material life means to become jealous. That is material life. Material life means you are jealous of me, I am jealous of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi conversation for a few sentences) <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣad bhagavat-praṇītam: [SB </span>6.3.19] "Religion is given by God." (Hindi) <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya, mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this is religion. (Hindi) They are not religion. They are cheating. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> "The cheating type of religion is kicked out." So we are following the same principle. We are kicking out all these cheating type of religion. It is explained any religion which does not recognize or do not understand the principles of religion, so that is cheating religion. Why religion? <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is religion. That is first-class religion, which teaches <span class="Italic">bhakti. Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje,</span> to the Supreme, which is beyond our perception. <span class="Italic">Akṣaja. Akṣaja</span> means within material perception. Beginning from "a" to "kṣa", whatever experience we have got... Or <span class="Italic">akṣa</span> means eyes, senses. So within sense perception, whatever is there... God is beyond sense perception. Therefore God's name is <span class="Italic">Adhokṣaja. Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.</span> That is first-class religion. Otherwise, there are so many religions, pseudo religions. They have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> as <span class="Italic">kaitava.</span> And Śrīdhara Svāmī gives his comments on this <span class="Italic">kaitava: chala-dharma. Chala-dharma</span> means cheating. And he says particularly, <span class="Italic">mokṣa-vāñchāpi nirastam.</span> That desire of merging into the Brahman effulgence, that is called <span class="Italic">mokṣa. Dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa [SB 4.8.41, Cc. Ādi 1.90].</span> Generally, people understand these four principles: religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and then merge into the effulgence, <span class="Italic">mokṣa,</span> liberation. So Śrīdhara Svāmī says, up to <span class="Italic">mokṣa-vāñchā</span> is cheating, <span class="Italic">kaitava.</span> Up to <span class="Italic">mokṣa-vāñchā. Mokṣa-vāñchāpy atra nirastam, kevala bhagavad-upāsanā.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> That is real <span class="Italic">dharma. Bhagavad-upāsanā.</span> So we are teaching that religion, <span class="Italic">bhagavad-upāsanā.</span> Simply. We have no such ambition, to be elevated to the heavenly planet or to merge into the Brahman effulgence. No. We can live anywhere, even in the hell. It doesn't matter. But our worship of Kṛṣṇa shall continue. This is our religion. So we are not ambitious to go to heaven or higher planetary system or higher standard of life. We have no such ambition. We simply want Kṛṣṇa and worship Him, that's all. Never mind where it is. This is real <span class="Italic">dharma. Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.</span> So this boy has become your <span class="Italic">celā</span> (disciple). He's very nice boy. What is his name, Dhruvānanda? Or his father's name. What is your name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhruvānanda:</span> Dhruvānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Dhruvānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dhruvānanda. Yes. <span class="Italic">Aiye. Aiye, bache, Aiye bache.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) You are coming from where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> His, there's a place here, his.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> (Hindi conversation for some time with English words here and there.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> (Hindi) And I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed, and I have come back. I think the life is more peaceful here than it is in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> It's more peaceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Especially in Bengal, all, they have turned to be low...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Due to poverty, Guru Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ne,</span> culture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Culture <span class="Italic">nāsti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Poverty's not question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's basically the character, the problem of the character.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) They have no idea about Vedic... They are supposed to be preaching Vedānta philosophy, but they do not know what is Vedānta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I like this philosophy of Swami Rama-tirtha... But I read his literature and I quite liked his philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rama-tirtha also, he gave stress on <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span> Is it not? <span class="Italic">Oṁkāra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Hm. I think he is more on this <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> He believes that you should. Or... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Your karma is actually the other secret of success or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> There are so many. I think it is in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa explains that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's all his words, not outside words, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, (Hindi). First I went there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have got your own house there, Dehra Dun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, I tried to buy house, and I made deposit and everything. I wanted to buy the house. Then I came to England to raise the money. I raised the money and went back to India. And by the time I went back, there were four litigations going on on the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> "I got this right on this house."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> There were four litigations going on on that house, and, you know, they all wanted the possession of the empty, vacant part of that house. I mean it was part possession property. They all wanted possession of the vacant part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So anyway, fortunately, the vendor also told me he doesn't want to sell. I said "Thanks to God." So he gave me the money back...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you returned. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> ...and I got out of it. I was lucky, really, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So I was very lucky, really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi conversation for some time) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...otherwise, in his preaching, he never stressed. He said,</div>
<div class="Verse">kibā vipra kibā nyāsī śūdra kene naya<br class="calibre2"/>yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"It doesn't matter whether he's a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">śūdra;</span> it doesn't matter. If he knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, then he's all right." So this is very reasonable. One requires to know the science. (Hindi) People are interested in whether he knows medical science. That's all. He may be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> It doesn't matter. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa consciousness means one should be Kṛṣṇa conscious. He should know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Then he's all right. It doesn't matter what he is. Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Just like Śaṅkarācārya, (Hindi) First of all, you become <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Then you talk of spiritual thing. That was his condition. And he would simply offer <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> to the caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Nobody else. Stricture. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very liberal, that "Either you become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> it does not matter. You must know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can act as spiritual master. You must know the science of Kṛṣṇa." So he's Dhruvānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Dhruvānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guests:</span> Dhruvānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dhruvānanda. And what is your father's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhruvānanda:</span> Devadatta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Devadatta dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devadatta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Devadatta dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And your mother's name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhruvānanda:</span> Draupadī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Draupadī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That DDD. All "D". (Hindi conversation for few sentences.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That was a determination to learn. One has got the... He has written his own (indistinct) confusion ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct) what was Droṇācārya. He has taken his thumb for nothing actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, that was his test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In order to please Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> In order to please Arjuna. And that was his test. And that was his determination, that he rejected, and he learned the science, just, uh, faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In material world such competition is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not spiritual world. That is material. So Droṇācārya gave Arjuna the benediction that "You shall be the greatest archer." So in order to keep his promise, he made that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That wasn't, I think, what he did. (Paramahaṁsa or someone else enters.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śyāmasundara, Śyāmasundara is not in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, this is just a little preparation, burfi and a little kheer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Can't you bring him the plate like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I tried to find a plate. There's no... Should I leave it here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So so many stories he had memorized, and he started writing and asking many questions, Prabhupāda, so I'm not... But he has got the talent that if he'll get the right guidance and all this, he can easily translate <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> many stories in the book shape, in different articles, which can very much help in our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> And for six weeks, seven weeks, his holidays he can remain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Remain here. Then how he can develop it? So now you are quite free in next... All right? And he has memorized almost all your <span class="Italic">bhajana,</span> everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> All Caitanya's, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's, all these things, very nicely memorized. So I'm very glad, really. At least, he's on the right path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone can be on the right path provided rightly trained. Everyone has got the right of coming to the right path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I see there are a lot of young children in the <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> Do you run sort of a school for them all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You have your own school. Somebody teaches them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. They're just starting. Not yet started. But they're taking care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How many children are here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can lie down. He's feeling sleepy. Give him some pad, and sleep there. There is pad. Go and sleep here. Let him sleep there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? There is... Go and sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Go and sleep?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, go and sleep. Take rest. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> You know, Prabhupāda, when you came to my house that evening...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> You had <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana</span> at our house and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> We had a very funny incident after you left. After two or three days, my young daughter, you know... She's about two or two and a half at that time. She was sitting in one corner of the house, and she, you know, those cups like this you have to have, to keep under the furniture legs, you know, cup like this, she had two of them, and she was doing like that. And, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karatālas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> My daughter. I asked her, you know, "What are you doing?" She replied quietly, "I'm doing Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So that really hit me hard, and I thought, "Look, one day's <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga</span> can have that effect on life, how much bigger effect it would have..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intelligent, this is intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> "...if there's a greater association." And that really led me to India, and say, "Well, in India I would have more of these spiritual things and more of that atmosphere, environment." And, well, you know, that particular incident really struck me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can attend here. You remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> And, you know, it was the first time she saw a <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> first time in her life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the wonderful thing is that this is a method of spiritual realization which attracts even a child. Unless one denies to be attracted, everyone is attracted. Even a child, even a dog. This is the... Therefore it is universal. Unless you deny to accept it, attraction is for everyone. If the child is innocent, he immediately exhibits his attraction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I was really surprised when she said that, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I have seen many. As soon as there is chanting and dancing, small children, automatically they do like this. Automatically. They dance. We have got many children. They dance, they chant. And they fall down and murmurs all the <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> What is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Bhakta Viśvareta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Oh, he'll fall flat just like... And he will chant all these <span class="Italic">mantras. "Nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale...</span>" A small child at three years old. You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I mean, advancement has very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Good association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...effect, you know, on the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore we have got our school already in Dallas, to train small children like that. But there is formalities of this nationalism. What is the formalities? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Just... It's not very difficult. It's just that we have... There is a form that we assure the other countries that we will take care of this child's lodging and all his... So we're bringing children from other countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Is it only for boys, or boys and girls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No, boys and girls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> And they are very well looked after there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Up to fifteen, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, as far as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> As far as possible. Do you have a prospectus or anything about that school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, I have literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> You have literature about that school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's in charge.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Sure, later we can talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are good teachers. We are teaching Sanskrit and English especially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> They teach Sanskrit, English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is what. We are preparing them so that they can read our literature which is in Sanskrit and English. As soon as they can read, that's education finished. They will understand, practical demonstration, <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> worship of the Deity, and they play <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga,</span> they chant, they join Hare Kṛṣṇa chanting. They are not meant for any technology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That we do not train. We are training them to become actual devotee, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Not for become technologists. Technologists, there are many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think the spiritual element is also essential in life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. That is the only business of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There must be little bit of, at least little bit of spiritual element in life. Not the whole time. [break] ...I believe every [break] ...goes to this sort of school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> There are so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no idea.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, (indistinct) philosophy, (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, nobody can understand. Simply he can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is meant for him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...trouble to the poor animals. Why the poor animals should be killed? They have got equal rights. But these rascals, they will not give equal rights. [break]... National means one who is born in that land. The animals are born in that land. Man is also born in that land. Trees are also born in that land. But they are not national. Only human beings national. Imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> In Luton, before eighty years... When I was reading the history of Luton, on the page number 176, it was written that there was a great shortage of food before eighty years, and in some place people were cutting their own children and eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> This is written. If you like that book, I can send you. So the non-vegetarians...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cutting their children?!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Cutting their own children, killing them and eat them. In some private places in Luton, where I am residing now. The history of Luton has been published by the County Borough of Luton. The non-vegetarian food leaved them to such an extent that they couldn't stay without the meat. And they had to cut their own children. Now we are vegetarian. I have never tasted any meat. I don't know the taste of it. Still. we all exist on vegetables, all sorts of vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing happened in Kanpur in a hotel. One man was eating meat, and he found a little finger...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Finger of some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That was in the Bombay, in the Villa Parle, in my place, where I was living.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This gentleman went to the hotel and found a small finger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Small children cut up. And there was another case in Calcutta. The, one Chinaman, he was eating human being. And then...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They eat human beings. Nara-buli (?), sacrifice human being, still there is a class of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-bhāminī:</span> In South America, they take a human being. From the head down, they eat. Then the head, they shrink it until it becomes very small, and this is a great prize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi) That was on the television, given all this, in South America, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you, you keep the tiger's face after killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Does this food make effect on a human nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> These non-vegetarian foods and things like that. They definitely make effect on a human nature and behavior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is difference. George Bernard Shaw, he wrote a book: "You Are What You Eat." So eating has got effect. <span class="Italic">Sāttvikāhāra </span>or... Unless one is in the <span class="Italic">sāttvika</span> position, he cannot understand about self-realization. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> The human beings get dreams, and what's the lesson between the dreams and the actual life. Suppose I have a dream at night...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dreams mean that is also change of body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> It has nothing to do with the human...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, dream... Just like you forget about this body. Just you have forgotten what body you had in your last birth, similarly, the same experience daily happening. When you dream, you forget that you have got this body. And again, when you give up your dreaming, you come to this body, you forget in what body you were dreaming. So this is the proof that you are living entity, but the body's changing daily. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> But these rascals, they do not understand that there is the <span class="Italic">dehāntara.</span> They are experiencing daily that there is <span class="Italic">dehāntara,</span> but they do not have any education about this <span class="Italic">dehāntara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (Sanskrit:) <span class="Italic">Viśvambhara para dṛśyamānaṁ nagarī tulyāṁ na janāntara-gataṁ, paśyam ātmani māyayā bahir ivodbhuḥataṁ yathā nidrayā, yaḥ sākṣād kurute prabodha sameya svātman eva advayam, tasmai śrī guru-mūrtyenam etaṁ śrī taksna mūrtaye.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles.) Yes. So this education is wanting. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> As soon as one understands that "I'll have to change my, this body; then what kind of body I'm going to get next life." That next inquiry will be. Then he is intelligent. Then he is intelligent. Just like one man is working somewhere. Now, notice is given that "From such and such date, your work will not be required." Then you become anxious to know: "Then what shall I do next." I have to work. So similarly, if a person understands that he's going to change this body... Just like I'm an old man. I'll have to change in, say, immediately, or say five years, ten years. But the notice is already there because I am old man. So it is my duty to think: "Then what body I'm going to take next?" That is intelligence. And we have to prepare for that. So that is also described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25].</span> You can prepare yourself to go the higher planetary system, where demigods live. <span class="Italic">Pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ.</span> You can go to the Pitṛloka. <span class="Italic">Bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā.</span> If you want to remain within this planetary system,... <span class="Italic">yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām.</span> "And anyone who is engaged in devotional service, he comes to Me," Kṛṣṇa says. So why not go back to Kṛṣṇa? <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6].</span> "If one comes to My place, he never comes back again in the material world." That is intelligence. Why not go back to Kṛṣṇa? But they have no intelligence. They're spoiling their life, simply living like cats and dogs. This is the position. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to save them, that "Don't go again to the cats and dogs category; go back to home, back to Kṛṣṇa." There is... Here is the possibility. Kṛṣṇa says. Why don't you take advantage of this? Kṛṣṇa says: <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ: [Bg. </span>4.9] "Anyone who tries to understand Me, Kṛṣṇa, what I am..." <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa, one stops his rebirth in this material form. He goes back to Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are training people that "You have to take another body. So what is the use of taking...? Even if you take the body of demigod, like Brahmā, millions of years age..." That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhag ... ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna [Bg. </span>8.16]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣīne puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti [Bg. </span>9.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣīne puṇye punaḥ martya-lokaṁ viśanti.</span> So why should we waste our time. Even I become Brahmā, again we have to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">, kṣurasya dhara niśita duratyayā.</span></div>

So that is there said: <span class="Italic">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā.</span> Very difficult. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> So why don't you do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha sarva-bhāvena bhārata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they'll not do this. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. They'll not do it. They're determined to suffer. So what can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Sva-dharme nidhanaṁ śreyaḥ para-dharmo bhayāvahaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not know what is the <span class="Italic">sva-dharma. Sva-dharma,</span> that is for the lower stage. <span class="Italic">Sva-dharme nidhanaṁ śreyaḥ.</span> You have got a brahminical body. All right, discharge your duties as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> But he's not doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> So he's not performing his <span class="Italic">sva-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> And that's why it is dangerous for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is dangerous. He's already... A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is doing <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> business. Therefore this stress has been given. You have become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa-</span> like, you do like, act like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Janma-karma,</span> uh, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma.</span> So you have got good qualification of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Now act like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then your life is succ... <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ, svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam [SB 1.2.13].</span> You act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and satisfy the Lord, Supreme. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśramācaravatāṁ puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān, viṣṇur ārādhyate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you strictly act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> it doesn't matter. <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> If, by your action, as it is described in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> the Supreme Lord is satisfied, then your life is successful. But they are not doing even <span class="Italic">sva-dharma,</span> bodily. Therefore the ultimate solution is <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even <span class="Italic">sva-dharma.</span> "Just surrender unto Me. I'll give you protection." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān</span> means <span class="Italic">sva-dharma,</span> including, that "You have to give up your <span class="Italic">sva-dharma.</span> Don't... You cannot act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> you cannot act as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> neither you are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> All right, whatever <span class="Italic">dharma</span> you have got, give it up. Just surrender unto Me. I'll give you protection." <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etām...</span> This is the protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi conversation continues for some sentences.) Who is practicing this? <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> He cannot be called a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> unless he acts according to his <span class="Italic">guṇa.</span> If he's acting in differently, he should be... [break] ...utilized by the liberated person, still we can use it, provided we stop this process of animal killing. Then it will be very easier. This medicine... The doors will be... <span class="Italic">Vinā paśughnāt [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> Therefore whoever comes to us to become our student, our first proposition is that "You should give up these four principles, illicit sex, animal-eating, gambling and intoxication, up to drinking tea, coffee, cigarette." This is our condition. So the more you practice to these four prohibitive regulations, then you realize. <span class="Italic">Śrotramāno 'bhirāmāt.</span> It will be very pleasing to the ear and to the mind. And unless anything is very pleasing, you cannot continue. Artificially, you can chant for few minutes. But if it becomes pleasing to you, then you can chant twenty-four hours, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tṛṇād api sunīcena<br class="calibre2"/>taror api sahiṣṇunā<br class="calibre2"/>amāninā mānadena<br class="calibre2"/>kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Ādi 17.31]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So this is the only remedy, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Therefore you'll find all our students, they have got these beads. We have got these beads. Either we shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa or we shall talk of Kṛṣṇa. That is also chanting. When you talk of Kṛṣṇa, that is also chanting. <span class="Italic">Kīrtana, kīrtana</span> means <span class="Italic">kīrtayati,</span> talking, speaking. Just like Parīkṣit Mahārāja. Parīkṣit Mahārāja: <span class="Italic">śrī-viṣṇoḥ śravaṇe parīkṣit.</span> The item is <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> About Viṣṇu, to hear and chant. So simply by hearing about Viṣṇu, Parīkṣit Mahārāja became liberated. <span class="Italic">Śrī-viṣṇoḥ śravaṇe parīkṣid abhavad vaiyāsakiḥ kīrtane.</span> Vaiyāsaki, the son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he became perfect <span class="Italic">kīrtane,</span> by <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> But he... He was... He did not chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> but he recited <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So that is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Talking of Kṛṣṇa, that is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana. Kīrtana</span> does not always mean that you have to chan... You have to engage yourself always in glorifying the Lord. Just like Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. He was a busy emperor of the world, but he engaged himself... <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsām... kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ. Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ [SB 9.4.18].</span> He fixed up his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This is first. If you fix up your mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then: <span class="Italic">sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane</span> and he was talking only describing and glorifying Vaikuṇṭha. God's another name is Vaikuṇṭha. In Madras they say Veṅkateśvara. Vaikuṇṭha. <span class="Italic">Kuṇṭha</span> means anxiety. So God has no anxiety, and God's devotees have no anxiety. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">vaikuṇṭha.</span> Here in the material world everyone has got anxiety. Therefore it is <span class="Italic">kuṇṭha,</span> the world of <span class="Italic">kuṇṭha,</span> anxieties. Everyone. Birds, beasts, human beings. There must be <span class="Italic">kuṇṭha.</span> So God is Vaikuṇṭha. The <span class="Italic">vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.</span> This is also chanting, <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> to describe about Vaikuṇṭha. Vaikuṇṭhaloka, Vaikuṇṭha person, Vaikuṇṭha devotees. So this is the remedy of <span class="Italic">bhavauṣadhi. Bhava. Bhava</span> means to take birth. <span class="Italic">Bhava.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">bhava-saṁsāra,</span> this material world. Here <span class="Italic">bhava,</span> you take birth, you live for some time, again you die, again take birth. This is going on. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">bhava-saṁsāra,</span> repeatedly taking birth and death in different species of life, different planets and different forms, 8,400,000 species, varieties. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says <span class="Italic">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">,</span> we living entities, we are wandering in this way, changing different bodies, different situations, different position and in this way wandering up and down, <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍa bhramite,</span> within this universe. Sometimes in the upper, heavenly planet, sometimes down in the hellish planet. Sometimes as human being, sometimes as cat, dog. Sometimes <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> sometimes <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> like that. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that the living entities are wandering like this. <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite. Bhramite</span> means wandering. <span class="Italic">Kona bhāgyavān jīva.</span> One fortunate person, <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">,</span> by the grace of guru and by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, one gets the seed of devotional service. <span class="Italic">Mālī hañā kare sei bīja āropaṇa</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.152]<span class="Italic">.</span> And when you get a nice seed of plant, you sew it. So that seed has to be sewn within the heart. <span class="Italic">Mālī hañā kare sei bīja āropaṇa, śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana.</span> So if we sew the seed within the heart and water it... And the watering required. The watering is this <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then it grows. And in due course of time, it gives you the fruit, which is love of Godhead. Then your life is successful. This is the process. So we have to try to sew the seed of devotional service within our heart, and it has to be watered by hearing and chanting. Then gradually it will grow. This is the process. And this is open for everyone. There is no restriction.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Can he insure that somebody will not die? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> He said he has established a very good insurance business. So I put the question that can he insure that somebody will not die. That he says "I have got a very good business." What is that good business means... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> I'm out of business. If you take that to me, I'll be out of business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, good, God is all-good. Therefore any business dovetailed with God, that is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Any business based on ethic is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter, what business. <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sva-karmaṇā,</span> by his own business... Just like Arjuna's business was fighting. He was <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So <span class="Italic">sva-karmaṇā,</span> by his fighting business, he served Kṛṣṇa. He fought for Kṛṣṇa. So he became successful. So any business, it doesn't matter. There is another verse in the <span class="Italic"> Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> The Sūta Gosvāmī said-all the meeting was being held by learned scholars and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> in Naimiṣāraṇya-so he said, <span class="Italic">ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhāḥ.</span> You are all very first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> So this is the verdict. <span class="Italic">Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> According to the division of <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> Four <span class="Italic">varṇas: brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> And four <span class="Italic">āśramas: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> This is Vedic civilization, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama. Varṇāśramācāravatāṁ puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]. When a human being comes to these institutional activities, <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> at that time he is recognized as human being. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśramācāravatāṁ puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate...</span> But that is the beginning of Viṣṇu worship. So Sūta Gosvāmī said, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> You may be a <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> It doesn't matter. These divisions will go on. <span class="Italic">Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama... Varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ</span> must be there, division. <span class="Italic">Vibhāgaśaḥ svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam [SB 1.2.13].</span> Simply you have to see whether by executing your particular type of business you are pleasing the Supreme Lord. That's all. If by your activities, by your business, the Supreme Lord is pleased, then it is successful, good. Just like Arjuna. The same example. He was a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> He knew how to fight. But by his fighting, he pleased Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he's successful. Similarly, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> let them do his business. It doesn't matter. But see whether you are pleasing Kṛṣṇa. Then you are successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> How does one find out that this act is pleasing Kṛṣṇa or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> For example, a soldier fighting in a war...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then you have got to talk with Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Or somebody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Arjuna talked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> No, I mean, for example, you know, somebody dropping bomb in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. How does he know...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you cannot drop. You cannot drop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> How does he know that he is pleasing God or he's not pleasing God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that... Therefore you have to know how to talk with Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be possible. You cannot manufacture. And that is that you can talk with Kṛṣṇa by devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Because apparently, you know, to a layman, this killing wasn't an act which will please Kṛṣṇa, and that, what Arjuna did, kill such a big army and everything, it will... Normally you know, a layman would have thought it won't please Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa, if you cannot meet Kṛṣṇa, you can meet with Kṛṣṇa's representative. Kṛṣṇa may not be physically present, but His representative is physically present. You can talk with him. That is the system of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Paramparā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that "I talked with the sun-god." <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> "First of all I talked with the sun-god." <span class="Italic">Vivasvān manave prāha.</span> "Then he talked with his son, Manu. Then Manu talked with Ikṣvāku. In this way..." <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam,</span> there is a disciplic succession. So if you can be in touch with that disciplic succession, then Kṛṣṇa's representative is there. If you talk with the Kṛṣṇa's representative, then you talk with Kṛṣṇa. Just like in office, there are different departments, and the, there is a man, departmental-in-charge. So if you can talk with that departmental-in-charge, if you can please him, that means you are pleasing the proprietor or director. There is no doubt. Because he is representative. So physically you may not meet Kṛṣṇa, but in higher stage, you can meet. But accepting that you cannot..., but He, you have to be in contact with His representative. That is coming in disciplic succession. Then you talk with Kṛṣṇa. It is not difficult. The <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> are there. <span class="Italic">Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyām.</span> Kṛṣṇa says. "All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas," māṁ vijānīyām,</span> "they are Myself." <span class="Italic">Nāvamanyeta karhicit,</span> "Never disregard <span class="Italic">ācārya." Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyāṁ nāvaman..., na martya-buddhyāsūyeta</span> "Do not be envious: 'How he can be? He's ordinary man. How he can be representative?' " No. Anyone who is talking of Kṛṣṇa as Kṛṣṇa talked, he's Kṛṣṇa's representative. Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supreme." So if anyone says, "Kṛṣṇa is supreme," then he's Kṛṣṇa's representative. It is not very difficult. Because the same talking. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> If somebody says that "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa," then he's Kṛṣṇa's representative. But if somebody says, "Kṛṣṇa is not God. I am God," then he's not representative. To talk with Kṛṣṇa is not difficult. You find out the representative, talk with him, and you are talking with Kṛṣṇa. That's all. So Catur-bhuja, where he has gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> To bring some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. (Someone enters.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Now, while Bhīṣmadeva was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, why he has taken the Kaurava side? Many people ask about... He knows Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all give him. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> ...and still, he took the side of Kauravas in the fight, being a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and he knew that Pāṇḍavas were right and Kauravas were not right. So many times this question has been very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he wanted to be killed by the devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> By God. (background talking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> O.K.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He followed the moral principles of this material world. He thought... He expressed that "Duryodhana...," he knew that "Either be on Arjuna's side or not, Arjuna will be victorious. Because Kṛṣṇa is there. So let us fight with..." Because <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> this fighting is sporting. You see. That is not any difficult task for them. So he showed these moral principles, that "These people are maintaining me, Duryodhana... They are maintaining me. I am old man, and they are taking care of me, and they are expect... So when they are in danger, I shall go to his enemy's side? Oh, this is not good." That he saw. And he knew that, "Even if I do not go to this side, he'll be victorious." So he showed these moral principles. "So one is maintaining me and he is in now danger, I go to his enemy's side, that does not look well."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Morally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> That's the question we were discussing. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Oh very well. We discussed this point in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> and these young boys, they tried to very closely to the point so that if I put the question before you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If somebody is maintaining you, and when he's in danger, you go to his enemy's side, that does not look nice. Yes. Otherwise, everyone was on Arjuna's side. Droṇācārya. But they considered like this, that "They have maintained us so long. And now there is fight, and we shall go to the enemy's side. What is this? What people will say? 'Treacherous.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Traitors. And what about the Vidura? Why he went away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vidura was neutral. He left home when he understood that "Fighting is now inevitable. They'll fight. Why shall I remain here?" He left home. And Kṛṣṇa also said that "I will not fight. I'll not fight because this is family quarrel. I am known to every one of you. We are related. So I cannot take this side or that side. I may be..." He divided... He, by tricks... His soldiers one side, and He Himself one side. So Duryodhana preferred, Duryodhana preferred His soldiers, that "Why shall I take this one man. I'll take His soldiers." And Arjuna said, "No, I want Kṛṣṇa." So Kṛṣṇa said, "Although I'm going to your side, but I'll not fight. Mind that." And, "Never mind, You don't fight." <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> is very nice. "Greater India." <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> means "The History of Greater India." <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata. Mahā</span> means "greater."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> That inspired the devotees, really, like anything, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that was written for <span class="Italic">strī-śūdra-dvija-bandhūnām</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>1.4.25]<span class="Italic">. Mahābhārata</span> was written by... This is history, but it was written by Vyāsadeva for woman, <span class="Italic">strī, śūdra</span> and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu. Dvija-bandhu</span> means those who are born in high family, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> but they are not cultured as their forefathers. They are called <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu.</span> And they are compared with <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> So <span class="Italic">strī-śūdra-dvija-bandhūnām.</span> For these women, <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu, Mahābhārata</span> is Vedic literature. But for their understanding... They could not understand the Vedic language directly. Therefore <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> was written. And in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> he gave the topics, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the essence of all Vedic literatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> The Haryana government is constructing very gigantic, you know, temple over there at the birthplace of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> at Kurukṣetra. I was there ten days before.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The government of India is constructing a temple there? Is that what you said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Haryana government is particularly concerned about that, you see.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You give, yes. You, whoever you have not given, you give. She does not know.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the difference between an innocent person and an ignorant person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Innocent person means he's not offender. And ignorant is sometimes offender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A child is innocent, and his father is ignorant. His father may be knowing something, and purposely does not take. That is ignorance. Or he thinks that "What is the use of taking it?" That is ignorance. And innocent, he does not know anything. Actually, practically, there is little difference, but if you ask, you can differentiate in this way. Just like in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> is ignorant, and he does not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone, according to our Vedic culture, for the last five thousand years, everyone accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he'll not do. He will say, "Why Kṛṣṇa will be the Supreme Lord? I am also." This is offense. This is offense. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtinaḥ.</span> This offense is created on account of sinful life. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtinaḥ.</span> Innocent has no sinful life. Otherwise there is no difference between ignorant and innocent. Purposefully, when one remains ignorant, foolish, purposefully... He'll not accept. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ.</span> According to Vedic culture, Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But there are many purposefully who will not accept Him. What can be done? They will argue. They will not accept the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they accept Kṛṣṇa. Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya. They are the leaders of Vedic culture at the pre..., in the present moment. They are accepting. But other, foolish people, they are not accepting. <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.</span> They have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> their knowledge has been taken away by māyā. Although they appear to be very learned, but actually, a sense of knowledge has been taken away by māyā. <span class="Italic">Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.</span> Real thing they do not understand, nor, or refuse to understand. So they are offenders. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, <span class="Italic">māyāvādī haya kṛṣṇe aparādhi.</span> "All the Māyāvādīs, they are offenders to Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Dviṣataḥ krūrān.</span> They're envious, <span class="Italic">krūra.</span> "I put them into the hellish condition of life." These, these Europeans and American boys, they're innocent. I have told them that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." They have accepted. That's all. Others, they will argue, "Why Kṛṣṇa shall be...?" They're offenders. Yes. They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa; still they will argue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Because they're ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Because they're ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No ignorant. Purposefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Purposeful, knowing that, knowingly that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord and Supreme Authority, even then, if they ignore it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Knowingly means that every Indian knows that Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At least... The every Indian, at least Hindus, they perform Janmāṣṭamī, accepting Kṛṣṇa. But still, they will not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality. They'll bring many other competitors. "Why Kṛṣṇa shall be...? I have got Durgā. I have got this, Śiva. I have got that. I have got that. I have got that." This is going on as Hinduism. So many gods. So many gods. Although the Vedic literature says, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. </span>In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> Everyone reads <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "There is no more superior than Me." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ: [Bg. </span>10.8] "Everything is emanation from Me." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there, but they'll not accept. Therefore they are offenders. Otherwise where is the difficulty? God is one. That is accepted. <span class="Italic">Eko brahma.</span> God cannot be two. God is one. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām ekaḥ</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> One <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> one eternal, one living being..., that is Supreme. We are living being. We are also <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> eternal. But he is <span class="Italic">nityo nityānām.</span> He is the chief of the <span class="Italic">nityas.</span> He's the chief of the living entities. So that is chief. Kṛṣṇa personally says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "There is no more superior living being than Me." So these things are there in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> And they are supposed to be Vedic scholars, but they do not know the simple thing. So in that way they are ignorant. They read the Vedic literatures, but they do not understand, or they misinterpret in a different way for their own purpose. So they are, they're offender. Otherwise, there is no difficulty. This Māyāvāda philosophy has created this situation, that "God is impersonal, and, everyone can become God, or everyone is God." This Māyāvāda philosophy has created this havoc. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended that <span class="Italic">māyāvādī haya kṛṣṇe aparādhi.</span> "All the Māyāvādīs, they are offenders to Kṛṣṇa." Therefore they cannot make any progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That difficulty is there-offenders. And later on, there are so many institutions. They say that "You can create your God. You can become God." That is going on. "Whatever you think as God, that is God." So how one can make progress under these circumstances? One gentleman was arguing with me... He was supporting Rama-Krishna Mission. He said, "Even stool I consider God. It is God." (laughter) He came to this point. "If I worship stool as God, then it is also God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He would take it as <span class="Italic">prasāda?</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is going on. What can be done? And here, in the western countries, they are innocent. I have told them that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, Supreme God." They have accepted it. Just like child. So they are making progress. And people are astonished, "How these westerners, they have become so nice devotee?" But they have accepted it without any argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I used to argue all the time. (laughter) You used to win every time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, what is the miracle. I simply present that "Here is God, Kṛṣṇa. And just chant His name, holy name." And they're doing that. But Indians will not do that. They'll say, "Oh, this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> we have seen." And one, one student in Berkeley University, Indian: "Swamiji, what this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement will do? We want now technology." That's all. They take it as very trifle thing. Not seriously. Although in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said,</div>
<div class="Verse">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam<br class="calibre2"/>kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Ādi 17.21]</div>

<div class="After-Verse">They'll not take to it. So they purposefully remain ignorant, or by their misfortune, they remain ignorant. But those who are innocent, they take it, and they get the result. That's all. Fire is fire. Either you take it by understanding or not understanding, it is fire. It will act. And that is their advantage, that these European and American boys and girls, they have taken, accepted what I have said, and they follow. They're making progress. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato 'nartha...</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]. These are the different stages.

What is that? <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya:</span> "If one becomes devotee of Kṛṣṇa, then all perfection comes." If one believes in this, that is the faith. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā,</span> with this faith one has to begin. Then the faith has to be increased by <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">,</span> by association with a devotee. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then actually executing the devotional service. <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.</span> Then all misgivings will go away. <span class="Italic">Tato niṣṭhā.</span> Then he becomes fixed-up. <span class="Italic">Tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ.</span> Then attraction. <span class="Italic">Tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ athāsaktiḥ.</span> Then he cannot leave. <span class="Italic">Āsaktiḥ. Tato bhāvaḥ.</span> Then ecstasy. <span class="Italic">Sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet...</span> These are the different stages of <span class="Italic">sādhaka,</span> of a devotee, how to make progress. So in the beginning they're faithless. Faith is that <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva...</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> When he captures this slogan, that "Simply by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, I shall be all-successful," this is the beginning of faith. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> creates this faith. But one who does not take even this faith, how he'll make progress. Progress means the progress of the same faith, up to the love of Godhead. That is perfection of faith. So these are the stages. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ, athāsaktis tato bhāvaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the stages. So this institution is meant for training people from different stages, and beginning with this faith, that <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta...</span> "Simply by becoming devotee of Kṛṣṇa, my life will be perfect." This faith is the basic principle. So unless one comes to this basic principle of faith, there is no question of progress. So little faith, even. Not full faith. It develops by <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">,</span> by association with the devotees. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. If we adopt, then everyone can make his life successful. There is no doubt about it. Just like if you enter into a school, if you follow the regulative principles of the school and study, you, one day, you become M.A. Where is the difficulty? Where is the difficulty? But if from the beginning, if you have no faith, then what progress you'll make? If you, from the very beginning, if you think, "What will be, this school will do me? They're learning ABCD. What...?" (laughter) There is no faith. You may call it blind faith. But that is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Faith begins from the association of devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that, that faith becomes stronger by association; by association of the devotees, the faith becomes stronger. And the more your faith becomes stronger, you make progress. This is the way. Progress means the same faith becoming stronger, stronger, strongest. The same faith. The principle is the same, Kṛṣṇa. Then you know more about Kṛṣṇa. Then you become more faithful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Is this faithfulness, is it a product of the mode of goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. Goodness helps. But not... Unless you take it seriously... Then it depends upon the person. Even if he's not in goodness... That, just like all these European and Americans. They were not in goodness. They were on the platform of ignorance. But still, they, because they took it, therefore they are coming, progressively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Sometimes the... Kṛṣṇa says you can understand all behavior in terms of the modes of nature, the three modes. I'm trying to understand why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm... That is generally. Unless one becomes in goodness... But <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> is transcendental. It does not depend on the qualities of this material nature. <span class="Italic">Ahaituki apratihatā. Ahaituki. Apratihatā.</span> Nothing can check <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga.</span> Even one is in the platform of ignorance, it cannot check. It cannot check. <span class="Italic">Ahaituki apratihatā.</span> Because it is purely spiritual. It does not depend on material conditions. It does not depend on material... These goodness, passion, ignorance, they are material conditions. So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> does not depend on material conditions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Why is it then, that one person accepts it and another rejects it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That is from a spiritual position, his basic disposition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his choice, yes. We have got this independence, to accept or not to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> So does faith develop from accepting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Faith means acceptance. When you accept, then your faith begins. If you have got hesitation, then the faith has not begun. Or it is on the hazy state. (pause) Get the lights on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So in the human life the distinguishing feature is that his spiritual independence can show itself; whereas the animal is completely under the modes, but the human being, the modes' influence is reduced sufficiently so that he can make this decision, from, whether to accept or reject Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animals also can be delivered, provided he follows a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (11):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He's just asking for your blessings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Your blessings, Swamiji, will do a lot of good. He's involved in some personal family problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (11):</span> Personal family problem. I am now (indistinct)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> To eradicate disease, it needs counteraction. the... I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? This is recited from the <span class="Italic">śāstra, bhavauṣadhi.</span> This is the only disease, uh, only remedy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Remedy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And you haven't got to spend anything to purchase this medicine. Neither there is any loss. Why not try it for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Because it's free, that's why they're hesitating. (laughter.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (11):</span> (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> You can come in the morning. We have got... Guru Mahārāja speaks in the morning, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Morning (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> To chant Kṛṣṇa's name, I was wondering if I could have the blessing and the beads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can have the beads, but there is a process. Whether you are prepared to... Otherwise, you can chant. There is no restriction. You can take the beads and chant. But if you want to be officially initiated, there are certain rules and regulations, and other things. But without being officially initiated, nobody is barred from chanting. You can chant. Just like Ekalavya, he was speaking. Although he was not initiated by Droṇācārya, he became a good archer, simply by practicing. Similarly you can practice: chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Swamiji, tomorrow is Gaura-pūrṇimā. And a friend of mine, his father, or his mother died on Ekādaśī day. Husband and wife were, they had been fasting Ekādaśī doing <span class="Italic">Satya-nārāyaṇa-kathā.</span> So now father, he is very lonely, and he said, "I have got no guru." Then I told him about you. So he immediately grabbed the idea. He wants to come tomorrow, in the morning to have your blessings. But then is it possible that he could have the initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, let him come. First of all let him understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That man already comes. But tomorrow is <span class="Italic">Gaura-pūrṇimā.</span> That's why I thought if tomorrow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> If he deserves it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him come tomorrow. We shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Tomorrow morning? <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> The beads, Swamiji. He wants the beads. We can get it from the office?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, beads, they also purchase from the market. There is no harm. Either you take it from here or from the market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We buy our beads at the market also. The thing is that if someone wants to be initiated, then he has to be prepared to follow some principles, four principles. Prabhupāda just mentioned them. He must be prepared to give up all intoxicants, all illicit sex life, meat-eating, meat, fish, eggs, and no gambling. And chant the prescribed number of rounds, sixteen rounds. And anyone can be initiated, but he must be prepared to follow these restrictions. Otherwise, the effect of the chanting will not be as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> As effective as it would be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> So what you're saying is that there's no harm by his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can... That will help you in future to give up these habits. Chanting you can begin at any condition. But when we initiate officially, we take this promise. Then we initiate. This is our condition. <span class="Italic">Yatra pāpaś catur-vidhā.</span> According to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> these are four kinds of sinful activities: illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. But these are modern civilization. It is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Swamiji? Tea and coffee's also included?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also intoxicant. <span class="Italic">Pāna. Chāi, pāna. Pāna, pāna</span> means intoxication. <span class="Italic">Dhūmra-pāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> <span class="Italic">Dhūmra-pāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And what about <span class="Italic">supāri,</span> Swamiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also ingredient of <span class="Italic">pāna. Pāna,</span> it is called <span class="Italic">pāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I offered Vaikuṇṭhajī <span class="Italic">supāri.</span> You see he won't accept it. So I thought, well, it only helps digestion because it only brings the saliva in the mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, wine is also very digestive. (laughter) An appetizer also. All Europeans, they take first of all wine to eat voraciously. I see in the airplane. And after taking wine, they eat so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> And then they go for dancing to digest it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simple life, simple life, innocent life... Because after all, we have to give up this material world. If we become attached, then we'll have to take birth again. <span class="Italic">Nivṛtta-tarṣair...</span> There is another verse quoted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is very difficult, but there is possibility. <span class="Italic">Niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya. Bhagavad-bhajana,</span> those who are eager to go back to home, back to Godhead... <span class="Italic">Pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya.</span> On the other side of this material world. For him... <span class="Italic">Viṣayiṇāṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitāṁ ca, hā hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'py asādhu</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 11.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> For such person to be attracted by these material things is not good. It is suicidal. So material things, <span class="Italic">viṣaya,</span> simply increasing the method of eating, sleeping, sex life and defense. This is material activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Defense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Defense. Defense means... Just like we have discovered atomic bomb for defending. This is also material activities. So it requires time to learn. But one thing is, the beginning should be, as far as possible, our life should be sinless. Because in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you'll find, it is said, <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> "Anyone who is completely freed from all sinful activities." <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.</span> "And always engaged in pious activities, such person can become devotee." <span class="Italic">Te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> "He becomes free from the duality of this world, and becomes fixed-up in My service." So this is the condition, that <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> Without being sinless, nobody can understand what is Bhagavān, what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-bhajana.</span> Therefore this is the beginning of sinless life: no intoxication, no illicit sex... If you can, if somebody avoids these things, he does not die. It is simply a little practice. He's practiced to all these bad habits, and if he likes, he can give it up. It is not difficult. And this is <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> little <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> To become advanced in spiritual life, one has to accept some <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity. So this is a simple austerity. Therefore when we officially initiate, we get this promise from the student, that "You have to follow this." And that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Is it compulsory to have a full consciousness that he must shave his head?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is formality. But he must be prepared to observe formality also. But if it is very much objectionable, sometimes we excuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Now I have finished my one year, one year and one week, or something, for my practice, you know. So I'll be taking before and next year. Still, I... (laughs)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> I know. I stopped coffee because I don't have it often in my office staff. But tea, still, I'm thinking to leave the tea, you know. I see that Prabhupāda will ask me to give up everything, you know. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You'll have to replace it with something higher. When you want a cup of tea, you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's how I stopped smoking cigarettes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Because it creates some problems to somebody if you go somewhere, you don't want tea. Coffee... "Oh, no, I don't want it." They say, "What sort of drink?" "Oh no, I don't want anything." And about food, "No, only an ounce..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, when I was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> so they offered tea, I said, "I don't take tea." Then they said "Milk?" "Yes, all right. You can give me milk." I'd take little milk. Or you can take little cold drink, soda water. That sugar and water, little lemon. He wants to offer you something. So there are so many other varieties, varieties. But if he insists, "You must take tea," that is not hospitality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> But what happens is somebody else comes in, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Hospitality means <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hospitality means first of all, he should ask, "What can I offer you?" This is hospitality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Naturally, you know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Hospitality means the man should ask you, "What can I offer you?" That is hospitality. If he says that "I must give you tea, and you must drink it," that is not hospitality. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Hospitality is first... According to our Indian system, (Hindi) Then you can say, "Then you can give me a little sweet water." or "You can give me little milk." That's all. Hospitality does not mean I must force you, "You must take it." That is not hospitality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> (Hindi) Somebody comes to my place...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you should ask, "What can I offer you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> ...say, "A cup of tea will do." Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> We cannot give him cup of tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you cannot give, that "I have no tea. You take milk." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> No tea, now. Why do you keep that tea in the house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you offer milk or little sherbet, nobody will deny it. Even if he's a tea drinker, he cannot deny taking a little sherbet or little milk or a <span class="Italic">sandeṣa</span> or some sweetmeat or... What is that? You want to offer him something. So offer him... There are so many things. Why that particular tea should be offered. Is it very nice preparation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Another tea and coffee. The people generally want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I want things are nice, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> If we stop that one, I come to coffee and tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They might have gone to hell, but I am not... (laughter) I cannot offer him hellish things. <span class="Italic">Bhagavat-prasāda.</span> We are offering our <span class="Italic">Bhagavat-prasādam.</span> Nobody is denying. You can offer in the same way. We are not offering tea or coffee. Whatever we have got, take it. So this is artificial. We can avoid all these difficulties. There is no difficulty at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> No, what I (indistinct) I take but wife takes half, and children, they didn't take it, but they want a cup of coffee. One boy wants cup of coffee, the girl wants a cup of tea and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> But the... And when the... That is the... This is the problem...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This happened in my life... This happened in my life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Listen. Listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My wife was taking tea. So I asked her not to take tea, not to take tea. But she didn't care husband. Then I gave her final, that "Either you have to give up your tea or your husband." (laughter) So she agreed to give up husband, not tea. (laughter) So I left my home. That's all. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Due to tea!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> There won't be any place for me to go now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got such a big house. We welcome all. Yes, bad habit is... Habit is second nature sometimes, but one should be determined. Therefore we have got four <span class="Italic">āśramas: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> Whichever is suitable. Just like here. He's <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> His wife, children, all are devotees. So he doesn't require to become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He is lucky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, lucky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> He is lucky. For some of them, half of them, they go here, half of them go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has good wife, good children, all favorable for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He does not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> This is Prabhupāda's mercy really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but, that I'm saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> We have been living fourteen years in this country. They were brought up here, and they never touched tea. They were brought up here, school education and all that, fourteen years...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in England, in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> And I must say they are advancing more than me, really. I am still the same stage; by Prabhupāda's grace, they are advancing more, get up early in the morning, four o'clock, take bath...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this kind of family life is very suitable. This is wanted. All the wife... His wife is very nice girl. And she is good devotee. So if wife is favorable, then everything is favorable. Household life means cooperation with wife. <span class="Italic">Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhur gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate.</span> Just like we are also living within a room, <span class="Italic">gṛha.</span> But we are <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> What is the difference between <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> He lives with his wife. <span class="Italic">Gṛhiṇī gṛham ity āhuḥ. Gṛhiṇī</span> means "the wife is <span class="Italic">gṛha.</span>" So if the wife is favorable, devotee, then there is no use of giving up family life. That's all. We have got so many married couples. Just like this boy. He's married. His wife is there. They are favorable. Both husband and wife, they have dedicated life for Kṛṣṇa. So it is very nice. It is not that he has to become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> No. Why? There is no necessity. <span class="Italic">Gṛhe vā vanete thāko.</span> Either you become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> the life must be dedicated for Kṛṣṇa. That's all. That is required. And for Kṛṣṇa's sake, if we have to give up something, is that very difficult job? If Kṛṣṇa wants that "You give up this habit,"... Just like Kṛṣṇa says... If you become devotee of Kṛṣṇa... Now, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Kṛṣṇa wants that <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam,</span> "Vegetable, milk, rice, grains, you can give Me." So you have to please Kṛṣṇa. You live on this, what Kṛṣṇa says, and take Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That's all. (People coming in) <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...my dear boy, what best learning you have learned?" He was child, boy. So he said, <span class="Italic">tat sādhu manye 'sura-varya dehināṁ sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> "My dear father..." He did not address father as "Father." He addressed him as <span class="Italic">asura-varya,</span> "the best of the <span class="Italic">asuras."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> "Best of the <span class="Italic">asuras."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, "best of the <span class="Italic">asuras." Asura-varya. Varya</span> means the best. And <span class="Italic">asura...</span> Because his father was demon. So he was calling his father "demon number one." "My dear father, my dear <span class="Italic">asura-varya..." Tat sādhu manye 'sura-varya dehinām.</span> "Anyone who has accepted this material body..." <span class="Italic">Dehinām,</span> he has said. <span class="Italic">Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām.</span> "They are all full of anxiety." Anyone. Not only human beings, even animals, birds, beasts. You'll see, when a bird is there, he'll always, that, "Some enemy may not come." Even animals. Even tiger is afraid, although he's so powerful. Elephant is afraid. <span class="Italic">sadā samudvigna-dhiyām.</span> Why? <span class="Italic">Asad-grahāt.</span> "Because they have accepted this material body." Then what is the remedy? Now, <span class="Italic">hitvātma-pātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpam, hitvātma-pātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpaṁ vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> "They should not be satisfied with the society, family and love and this and that. They should take shelter of the lotus feet of Hari. Then they'll be happy." We are trying to be satisfied in this material condition, society, friendship, love and so forth, so on and we are after that. But there, there is no possibility. Unless you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">harim āśrayeta,</span> there is no possibility. The whole world is trying to adjust things of the society, friendship, love and material atmosphere. That cannot be. That is not possible. Only by taking shelter... Therefore Kṛṣṇa says. Not whimsically. That is the only remedy: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the only remedy. There is no other remedy. But they'll not take. What can be done? This is the only remedy, <span class="Italic">harim āśrayeta.</span> One should take shelter of Hari, Kṛṣṇa. Then he'll be happy. Otherwise it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Then we'll come in morning?</div>
