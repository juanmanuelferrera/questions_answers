<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We always say that the best way to water the tree is from the root, but he says that the way that nature actually waters is from the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So wherefrom the top water comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> By evaporation of the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who kept the ocean? You go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> By nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you come to somebody. That is foolishness. Then nature is not ultimate. Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate. Because you cannot see Kṛṣṇa, therefore you say, "Nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Nature is under My control."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is just like an equilibrium, Śrīla Prabhupāda. In science it is called equilibrium, means this on and off...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is called <span class="Italic">cakra.</span> What is that? In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">brahma-cakra, brahma-cakra. Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> That is realization, that in every action there is <span class="Italic">brahman.</span> The beginning, by eating food grains, you become strong. The animals become strong. Then, when you become strong, you perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> and from <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> there is cloud, and from cloud, there is rain, and from rain, there is food grains. This is the <span class="Italic">cakra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Cycle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cycle, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is the symptom of material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this <span class="Italic">yajña</span> means to satisfy the Lord. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe karma.</span> So when you miss this <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> then everything becomes disturbed. When you become godless then the whole thing will be disturbed. And practically also, if you pay income tax, then government arrangement is everything, nicely going on. And as soon as stop income tax, then whole thing... There is no finance, there is deficit, this, that, so many things. So <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is <span class="Italic">yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra.</span> Everything should be done for the <span class="Italic">Yajña,</span> for Viṣṇu. Then everything is in order. In Kali-yuga, other, costly <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> are not possible. Therefore <span class="Italic">yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ. Saṅkīrtana.</span> But these rascals will not take. If you say that "This simple <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> you take it. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> All problems will be solved," they will not believe. They will not take it. They are so misfortunate. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">. Su-medhasaḥ.</span> Those who have got good brain, they take up this <span class="Italic">yajña</span> process. <span class="Italic">Su-medhasaḥ.</span> And another word is <span class="Italic">alpa-medhasaḥ,</span> less brain substance. <span class="Italic">Tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām [Bg. </span>7.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are doing all other things, but not <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">alpa-medhasām:</span> their brain substance is small. And here is <span class="Italic">su-medhasaḥ. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the sign of merit: You do something which will produce good result. And if you, cats and dogs, if you simply jump over, what you will do result? That Lilavati Munshi of Bombay, she is the wife of a big man, K. Munshi. So she was asking, "Swamiji, how you made like this?" Everyone is surprised because nobody has done like this. I said that "Because I have taken the proper method, therefore it is done so nicely." The method must be right. It may be simple, but it must be right method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> She is Gujarati, Lilavati Munshi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, yes. She invited me this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> She is writer, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. She is very educated. Now, her husband made very great attempt for publishing book, but there is no sufficient customer. Now the press is going to be sold, and nobody customer. That is letter-setting press. Now it is obsolete. So they were perplexed. She wanted that I shall purchase. And what shall I do with this press? Letter setting is now abolished. That is not good job now. There must be litho press or, what is called, offset. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if... Since Kṛṣṇa is the power that gives the demigods the ability to render everything, then why is it recommended in the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion</span> that a Vaiṣṇava should worship Gaṇapati?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa worship, everyone. Just like we worship also ordinary man if it gives us facility to worship Kṛṣṇa. We go to somebody and worship him, flatter him, because he will give some money, and it will be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. The man is not worshipable, but he will help us to worship Kṛṣṇa. Thereby he will be helped and we will be also helped, and Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied that "My devotee has brought some money from this rascal. All right." That is... (laughter) So Gaṇapati is also devotee. So Gaṇapati, it is not required, but sometimes we do. Just like <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they worshiped Goddess Durgā, Kātyāyanī. They did not require, but the social system is that. But they asked that Mother Kātyāyanī, give us the opportunity to have Kṛṣṇa as our husband." The aim is Kṛṣṇa. Generally, they go to worship Devī Durgā for asking material benefit. <span class="Italic">Dhanaṁ dehi rūpaṁ dehi yaśo dehi,</span> the things which we want in material... But the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they do not go for any material things. For Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, we can go to any demigod. Why Gaṇapati? Everyone. But our prayer should be, "Please give us Kṛṣṇa." Then it is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> When we were just traveling this last time and collecting, Śrīla Prabhupāda, everyday we were offering some incense to Gaṇeśa, and this prayer in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> <span class="Italic">yat-pāda-pallava...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pallava-yugaṁ vinidhāya kumbha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> We were saying this, saying, "Give us facility to collect nice <span class="Italic">lakṣmī</span> to use to build the temple in Vṛndāvana."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> To build the temple for Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good. Whatever possible facility is available from any person, we beg for it for Kṛṣṇa's service, not for our personal benefit. [break] ...they forget Kṛṣṇa. They forget Kṛṣṇa. When they go to worship some other demigod, they forget Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]<span class="Italic">,</span> because they have got so strong material desires that they forget Kṛṣṇa. That is harmful. <span class="Italic">Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām [Bg. </span>7.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> They get some benefit out of the demigod, but that will not stay. <span class="Italic">Alpavat,</span> er, <span class="Italic">antavat. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām.</span> But if you take Kṛṣṇa, then it is not <span class="Italic">antavat,</span> it will go on increasing. If you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it will never end. It will increase. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam,</span> increasing. The ocean does not increase, but Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such a great ocean that it increases only. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Is it not better just to say, "Kṛṣṇa, whatever You decide. Whatever You give me, that I will accept." Like Kuntī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I take from Kṛṣṇa? You should give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> No, I mean. Instead of praying to demigods to give me something, saying, "Whatever you decide Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. No. A devotee never prays to Kṛṣṇa. They have to undergo so much trouble; still they never pray to Kṛṣṇa. They know that "Kṛṣṇa will give us ultimately protection. Let us do our duty." <span class="Italic">Tat te 'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇaḥ [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span> 10.14.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> When a devotee is in difficulty, he is not disturbed. He thinks, It is Kṛṣṇa's wish that I should suffer like like this. It is not suffering; it is my pleasure." Just like when a patient is undergoing surgical operation, there is pain, but he knows, "It is better for me." Therefore agrees, "Yes sir. You go on with your knife." So when you are surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa says that "I shall give you protection," so even in our distressed condition we must know that we are being protected by Kṛṣṇa. We should not be disturbed. Because we create so-called distress and happiness. Actually this world is distress. Here the so-called happiness is also distress. So why a devotee should be disturbed by distressed condition? <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> One time you said that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not difficult, but to remain determined, that is difficult. Determination is difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That determination comes by <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Therefore we have got rules and regulation. If you follow the rules and regulation, then you will be determined. Otherwise, you will be victim of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> The rules and regulation is there just to keep you fixed up in your determination. But if you don't follow, then you fall down. Just like physician says, "You don't take this along with medicine. You take this." That is rules and regulation. If you follow, then you do not become victim of disease again. If you don't follow, then you... What the physician will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> But it also requires determination to follow the <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if he cannot, then he is cat and dog. He is not a human being. Why he should accept initiation? Let him remain a cat and dog. He promises to follow, and if he cannot follow, then he is nothing but cat and dog. In the court, they take promises, that "In the name of God," "In the name of Bible." So that means he will speak the truth. Similarly, before the fire, before Deity, before guru, before devotees, he is promising something, and if he does not follow, then he is cat and dog. He cannot advance. It is not possible. That is the distinction between cat and dog and human being. Cat and dog, they cannot promise. It is not possible. But a human being can promise. And if he keeps his promise, then he is human being. Otherwise cat and dog. Word of honor. The cats and dogs, they have no sense of honor. Either you kick him or pat, he does not know what is the difference. That is cat and dog. He does not know the distinction. A human being knows what is promise, what is word of honor. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> ...you mentioned that the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they are considered to be the capitalists and the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they are considered to be the Communist. And you mentioned that eventually the communists will take over the capitalists. So how long do you think that will happen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What's the use? Why shall I think like that? Let them go to hell, and let us go back to home, back to Godhead. Why shall I waste our time? We can advise them, "Do this. You will be happy." If they do not take, then we don't bother anymore. We are not social welfare worker or political worker. We are worker for Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...in this world that people are suffering for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Let us try to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our only interest. Otherwise we have no interest in this material world. Let them do their own duty and suffer or enjoy. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu [Bg. 9</span>.29]<span class="Italic">. Samaḥ. Samatā.</span> We are not social worker or political worker. We are Kṛṣṇa worker. So we give advice to them that "You become Kṛṣṇa conscious and all problems will be solved." That is our duty; and to advise him, to convince him, to give him all facilities. Still, if he does not take, then we are not going to see how long he will suffer, how he will stop. Let them do their own business. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "Give up all nonsense engagement. Just become My devotee," we say like that. But if somebody does not give, give up, also not, then Kṛṣṇa also does not interfere. Let him suffer. [break] ...how long one suffers. He can stop his suffering immediately, but if he does not take the medicine, then what can be done? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> If Kṛṣṇa withdraws all his sinful activities, then where is the question of suffering? But he will not do. Now, because he is not surrendered soul to Kṛṣṇa, so he is suffering from time immemorial, and nobody can say how long he will suffer. He will go on suffering. It cannot stop. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mūḍha:</span> "Rascal." <span class="Italic">Na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ</span> [Bg. 7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not know, by simply surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, everything will be nice. That he does not know. And if you advise, he will not accept. <span class="Italic">matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā.</span> That is explained by Prahlāda Mahārāja, that "These rascals who have got this idea that 'By adjustment, we shall be happy in this material world,' they will never understand what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They will never understand because their aim is..." That picture we gave in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> anchor? Yes. Their anchor is to remain here and enjoy. That is their main disease. They do not... Just like the Russian astronaut has gone so high, he was seeing, "Where is Moscow?" The anchor is there in the Moscow. Therefore he has to come down. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> So everyone wants to keep this anchor of this material attachment. They say that "Yes, I am ready to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness, provided Kṛṣṇa gives us so many material..." Just like in Germany. So many women went to pray in the Second World War, "Oh, my husband may come back, my father may come back." But nobody came back. And all of them became atheists. You see? They take Kṛṣṇa, or God, as their servant, not to become servant of Kṛṣṇa, that "I prayed so much, 'Kṛṣṇa, God, give us our daily bread.' And He did not give. Therefore give it up."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the Vedic explanation of the working principle of the brain, how our brain is working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brain is working, because you living entity, soul, is there. Just like I am typing, and he is typing. I have got the latest mechanical, improved typist, and he has got old, bygone age typist, similarly, according to our <span class="Italic">karma,</span> capacity, Kṛṣṇa gives us facility. So brain is that facility. Kṛṣṇa gives us. Not that... So far the brain substance is concerned, a dog's brain and your Professor Einstein's brain is the same. His brain, same. But because Professor Einstein is advanced in knowledge, he is working differently. Otherwise, when Einstein, the soul is off from the body, and the dog is off from the body, you will see the brain, equally the same. So this, your scientists, they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say that there are about nine billion cells. They are called neurons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Just like I have given already. Why nine billion cells are there? Because you can work with it. I have given an electric running on typewriter because I know how to work it. Otherwise, this electric machine and the old electric machine, they are made of the same iron, but if I know how to work it, then I can utilize this machinery. But for a layman, it will be all the same. So that is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> According to <span class="Italic">karma,</span> we get a body. The body's machinery is also well-equipped, as I can work. This is nature's gift. Not that "This brain is first-class, that brain is first-class, er last class." All brain, last class. It is matter. The man who is working, the soul who is working, he is first-class, second-class, third-class. It is said clearly, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati: [Bg. 18.61] "Īśvara,</span> Kṛṣṇa, is situated in everyone's heart." <span class="Italic">Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā: [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">]</span> "He is offered a <span class="Italic">yantra,</span> a machine, made by material energy." But that is under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has asked the material energy "Give a good machine; he can work. Good or bad, as He wants, as He wants. That's all. Give him a..." <span class="Italic">yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> It is all bad. Either this electric machine or that manual machine. They are all matter. So anything material, that is bad. But he wants it; "All right, give it." That is going on. He wants this facility. Now before these motorcars, people were walking on foot. All business was being done. But we wanted a machine like that, so Kṛṣṇa has given us brain to manufacture. That's all. But what you will benefit by this? Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "You give up all this nonsense proposal." But they will not do that. They will create another nonsense desire. That desire should be stopped. That is desireless. Because they will go on simply proposing some nonsense desire... That is their material existence. Now, they have discovered this, made this motor, nice... Now there is problem, no power, gasoline. And if the gasoline is stopped, then your whole endeavor is gone. So this is their business. They are manufacturing something which will entangle him more and more. That he does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now they have reduced the output of big cars because previously they were making big cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Now how the business will... Another problem. The factory... How will so many men...? So they will create problem. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "You give up all this nonsense desire."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The airlines have laid off so many thousands of people because there isn't enough gasoline to fly all the aeroplanes. So they are just laying off people. They are becoming unemployed now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, one after another, problem will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Coming to the brain again, the, some people are working. Why some people are insane? For example, the mechanism of working the brain, some of the chemical pathways, they say, change, block. So some people become insane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Insane? Then he cannot work. That's all. Even if I give you good machine... Just like I do not know how to work on it, so similarly, if one does not know how to work, then it is useless machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They are thinking that by certain types of chemicals they can correct things like depression and unhappiness. They say it's all just a chemical situation in the brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that they propose so many nonsense things, but they cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are making experiments on rats now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. They will go on experimenting life after life. That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Next life they may have to experiment in a dog's body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And some of our politicians, he has become a dog. Yes. Nehru. He has become a dog, in Stockholm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I told that to my mother and she would not believe it. You know, people think that if someone is a great politician or something, he can never become something like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why the politician dies? If he has got so good brain, let him live forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> People have so much blind faith in people like Nehru and Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jawaharlal Nehru did not want to give up his Prime Ministership unless he was collapsed. So why he did not live if he is so intelligent? And Kṛṣṇa says, if you have to believe <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> "He has to accept another body." So why you should disbelieve that he has accepted a dog's body? Because the acceptance of body is not your business. It is the business of higher nature. <span class="Italic">Daiva-netreṇa.</span> So if the <span class="Italic">daiva</span> likes that "You must take this dog's body," how can you refuse it? You cannot refuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday in the paper I saw a picture. Nixon had his sixty-first birthday, and he had a big cake made, and he offered the first bite, the first lick to his dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad... ārto 'rthārthī.</span> He is in great distress. Now he is taking shelter of God. <span class="Italic">Ārto 'rthārthī.</span> Then he is good at least. <span class="Italic">Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna. Ārtaḥ. Ārtaḥ</span> means very much distressed. He is very much distressed than all the Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> He had a cake for his sixty-first birthday. He gave the first bite to his dog, d-o-g.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, not God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No, no, dog. (everyone laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Dog has become his God then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why he should not become dog? Become <span class="Italic">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi...</span> He has great love for dog, and it is said that <span class="Italic">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran loke tyajati [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">,</span> at the time of death, he will think of dog and he will become dog.
