<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> ...talking in the car on the way over, the other day you said that Govinda dāsī, she had asked you if in general that we would have to take birth in India before going back home and you said yes. So we were wondering (laughter) how that's possible that we have to take birth in India. Because we see that they're not very strict Vaiṣṇavas there. So what is it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The land is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Land is... Just like this land, Vaiṣṇava is there. This land is not meant for spiritual culture but still the Vaiṣṇavas are there. Similarly, in India, no, there are many Vaiṣṇavas there. The mass of people, they are all Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So by joining this movement we come to the platform where we can take birth in India in a nice <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can go directly also, if you want to finish your business. <span class="Italic">Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is a consideration, who, one who fails in executing. But if you become successful, then you go directly where Kṛṣṇa is there. Kṛṣṇa is there in some universe. So those who are completely liberated, they go to that universe. Just like when Kṛṣṇa comes here, in each and every universe there is a Vṛndāvana. So in that Vṛndāvana one takes birth. Then goes to original Vṛndāvana. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Those who are not able to maintain the Kṛṣṇa consciousness principle, then they may have to go to India next lifetime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śrīmatam, śrīmatāṁ śucīnāṁ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">śrīmatāṁ,</span> you can get here. <span class="Italic">Śrīmatam</span> means rich, rich family. Here you get many families, Ford family... But <span class="Italic">śrīmatāṁ</span> and <span class="Italic">śucīnāṁ.</span> So if you are creating so many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> so if this cult is permanent, then there will be many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family here also. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> ...someone had asked me yesterday. You say that the moon is self-luminous. So then... But during the course of the month there are times when only part of the moon is showing. The moon is not always full.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe some planet between. Maybe due to sun. So moon is above the sun. Above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yeah, albatross, sea birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They call them rain birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Rain birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They like to stay near the clouds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Above the clouds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Just below the clouds usually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...Siddhaloka the residents, men, they also can fly. Siddhaloka. They can go from one planet to another by flying. [break] ...eating, they come down, these birds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Do they come down to eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I've never seen them on the ground. I think they might be eating something in the rain. There's actually particles in the rain. Isn't there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a bird, <span class="Italic">cataka.</span> They drink rain water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The example is given, these <span class="Italic">cataka</span> birds, they want water from the cloud and they will never come down to take water, take water down. Similarly, devotees will simply depend on Kṛṣṇa. They'll not accept anything from this material world. [break] Example is given that sometimes the cloud, instead of giving water, gives thunderbolt. Still, they will not take water from down. That is a <span class="Italic">cataka.</span> Although it is... Sometimes they are punished-instead of water, they are given thunderbolt-but still, they will not take any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was wondering if it was more important to understand the universal make up or simply to accept what <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you don't accept <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No. But some of the things in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> are difficult to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, fool. Therefore it is difficult for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should not... You understand or not understand, you have to accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That is why we are asking so many questions about the moon and the planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so where is the doubt? It is a fact that they did not go to the moon. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I'm just trying to understand for preaching purposes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you try to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because I have a hard time explaining about the make up of the universe as far as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That make up is all right, what they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't understand them also, you don't understand here also. Then what you will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> What it is is that we're automatically taking as authoritative what the scientists say, but we don't think is authoritative what Śrīla Prabhupāda and the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, the difficulty I was having about this mountain, this Meru. It sounds... It's very difficult to explain that to someone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is difficult, but everything is difficult for you. Because you want to see. You have not seen their arrangement; neither you have seen our arrangement. So but your proposition is you don't believe what you don't see. You have not seen neither of them, so you have to remain silent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the best position is just remain silent until realization comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You should... Śukadeva Gosvāmī says. You have to believe that. It is an idea. If you believe or not believe, it doesn't matter. But you can get an idea about the planetary situation. That's all. Neither you can go there; neither you can see it. An idea is given, that is all. But there is no argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Did the people who said they went to the moon, did they go to another planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Or they did not go anywhere. They were in the desert... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arizona. That's all. That is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, it's possible. I wouldn't put anything beyond them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all doing this nonsense here on this planet and showing and advertising that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, they made big propaganda that they would get there, and then they had to succeed. And then they showed that they succeeded, they stopped the program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That one film?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Oh, King Kong. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> King Kong. It was made in laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Also 2001 was very expertly made like that. There is one movie, 2001, which looked even better than the moon shots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Someone was arguing with me that if, like Russia and America both are enemies, if Russia achieves something great like going to the moon, America will immediately try to expose it. But on the contrary, America accepted all those things. And because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is also... Both of them are thieves, they have made agreement, "Don't expose me. I'll not expose you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So that is their agree... But they are enemies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, enemies, they are not enemies. They are simply rogues and thieves, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Because if they tried to expose Russia, they would also expose themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> It's like these so many gurus. They're not actually enemies. They're actually individually working to exploit the people. And if they get in each other's way, if one person tries to take the other person's followers, then there's some clash or something. But as long they can leave each other alone and don't fight and work independently, exploiting, then they live peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Honor among thieves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Thief, thief, cousin brother." <span class="Italic">Cora cora, pasura bhai.</span> So far our position is that we are not concerned with anything with this universe. We are concerned with Kṛṣṇaloka. So whatever one may say, one other may say, we don't care for that. We are not going to the moon planet, Jupiter(?) planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> There's a danger that we become overly concerned with debating on them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So our preaching platform should be is that "You don't know." We can say, "You don't know" or "We don't know. Why shouldn't one accept what we say over what you say?" We should just prove that we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, accept or not accept, the whatever is description there, in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> we are accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So we should not try to meet these scientists on any scientific platform? Rather, on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Why not on the platform of not being the body? Why should you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Why not speak on what we're trying to speak about instead of overly indulge in that which is beyond debate actually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Ask them, "Are you the body?" If they say, "Yes," and then ask them to show how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like here in America I have come to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I am not interested for sight-seeing. That is not my business. Whatever you say, "It is here like this," "All right, That's all, finished." Why should we try to confirm it? Whatever you say, that's all right. Now, we are seeing the other part; if somebody there, "It is like this," that's all right. I'm not going to test it. So what is the use of arguing? I have no interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> The materialists, they want to argue on the platform of material arrangements, and there's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he will gain by such argument? You are not going there neither you are interested for going to the moon planet. For knowledge sake it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and everyone is... Just like when we speak of the hell, everyone is little anxious, "Where are the hell?" So that is described. In the down this universe there are <span class="Italic">lokas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So, in other words, it would make no... It would be not a very good program to get some understanding from Vedic astronomy, like, say, some expert Vedic astronomers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It would not be a good program...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what benefit you will derive there? Your problem is that if at the time of death you can remember Kṛṣṇa, then it is success. We are not going to any other planet. <span class="Italic">Yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25],</span> let them go. We are not interested in these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> There's only a certain amount of time and a certain amount of..., that we can talk about to people. And if we're talking about so many material arrangements, then it means that we can't be talking about that which is actually important. So we have to make a choice, whether we're going to get straight to the point or beat around the bush. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...no interest in a particular subject, why should you bother your head about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I become very fascinated when I read these descriptions in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> about the creation and the universal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That's gist idea of the universal position. That is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So, in other words, Śukadeva Gosvāmī is always bringing Mahārāja Parīkṣit to the platform of "Why bother with all of this? Simply perform devotional service"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No, no. He's giving full knowledge of the universal affairs. He also says at the end that "I have described whatever I have heard." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So we should simply describe it without being concerned that the scientific mind may make sense out of it or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this nonsense scientific? That is... We reject immediately. What is scientific? A tiny brain, what is their science? <span class="Italic">Phene bare dhake nate ute.</span> A snake catcher... There is a kind of snake which has no poison. So he cannot catch even that non-poisonous snake, and he's trying to catch one cobra. So these scientists, what is their value? What they have done anything contribution to the world for the benefit of the human society? They could not give any relief from the disease, relief from old age, relief from death or birth. These are the real problems. So what is their contribution? They have given some horseless carriage. Again there is problem of power. What is actually benefit they have done, that this is the benefit from the scientists? Anything they have done, there is counter disadvantage. This is simply waste of time. Our... We consider our human life is very valuable, and before the next death we should prepare ourself go back to home, back to Godhead. This is our philosophy. We cannot waste a minute time before the next death comes. That is our philosophy. So why should we waste our time, "Where is the moon? Where is sun?" Just have it gist idea, that's all. [break] ...no profit. Suppose the position of the moon is correct according to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> or according to the scientist, what benefit we shall get out of it? Whichever may be correct or wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not getting any profit out of it. So why should we bother about it? <span class="Italic">Adhara vapare jaj akalara.</span> We are dealing in ginger. Then what is the use of asking, "What is the hire, I mean to say, freight for a big ship?" If you are dealing with ginger, ginger is not sold by tons. When you go to purchase ginger, you take one or two pieces. So those who are dealing in ginger, what is the use of asking what is the fare of a freight ship? We are not going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> It doesn't have anything to do... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...be done by Darwin, that he will live for fifty years; he is giving account millions of years. "Some millions of years after, this evolution takes place like this." Huh? Will he live for millions of years? Why he's talking of millions of years? This is a waste of time. He will live for fifty years or, say, utmost, hundred years, and he's talking of millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Just like that man who wrote the letter yesterday. He's prepared to spend the rest of his life understanding the transfer, the transmigration of the soul instead of just accepting it in the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> He's going to spend his whole life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. His non-acceptance means he's a rascal. He's a rascal. He may waste his time in that way. What can be done? His non-acceptance means he's a rascal. It's evident. Anyone knows that "After this, I will get another body." You are all young men. You know that you will get after some years a body like me. So what is the difficulty to understand that we are changing body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So actually it's useless to try to give any more proof other than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sufficient for an intelligent man. That is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So if a scientist or someone who has some degree in science comes to our movement, should we encourage him to try to prove through science the Kṛṣṇa conscious principle of transmigration and eternal quality of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessary. Not necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Better if he just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not that if we prove scientifically there is soul, if there is scientific proof, not that all the people of the world will become Kṛṣṇa conscious, even if you do that. So it is useless. You simply understand what is stated by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Can a material calculation prove a spiritual fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Can a material calculation prove...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Materialists cannot understand spiritual subject matter. It is not for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So there is a project in Los Angeles where some psychologists are examining all the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Some psychologists are there. They are doing a laboratory test on all the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he may study in his own way, but he will not profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He will not profit. So this, the findings, even if they are published will not profit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The findings? They are going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is their findings? The devotees are working on the soul platform but he does not know what is soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> What are these experiments?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They're really far out. Actually, they're crazy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The psychology is on the mental platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what he will understand about spiritual platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually they can't. They put these little things around fingers with wires and heads and they find that the readings are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And our devotees also agreed to sit down like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. I thought it was ridiculous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They're probably getting some money for doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Every week they go, and every week another man comes, and they give all of these tests, psychological tests. We would say yes or no to different questions, material questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why do they agree to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They're being, more or less, forced to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They're probably being paid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> This is referring to that, in that transcendental meditation they have a chart that after transcendentally meditating, they are calm. But the result is that after chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, the devotees are more calm, and they can remain calm more than this result of the transcendental meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But actually, that's not true because some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That transcendental meditation, that is a bogus humbug. So they are making experiment. So in that way it is good for us, that they're better than transcendental meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But sometimes the devotees become very excited, you see, when we chant and the test goes up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> No, but this is... Dharmādhyakṣa was... He did it. The same result, they have to act the same way. They have to chant their <span class="Italic">japa</span> nicely. And then the transcendental meditationist will meditate his way. But the results are coming out better in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Dharmādhyakṣa, at least, and Guru dāsa said so I'm not sure. It hasn't been working yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that beyond the senses, the mind is there. Beyond the mind, the intelligence is there. Beyond the intelligence, the soul is there. So they are studying the mind. They are not even on the intelligence platform, and what to speak of spiritual platform? <span class="Italic">Mano-rathena asato dhavato, bahiḥ.</span> These rascals, those who are on the mental plane, they will remain materialists. That's all. They will not know, understand anything spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So even if someone were to read the results of such a test, it would not convince them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What...? What you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They're testing after a material thing. Try to understand it. They're testing the mental plane and they're thinking that that's the spiritual plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their position is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā.</span> These rascals, <span class="Italic">avajānanti,</span> I mean to say, cares a fig for Kṛṣṇa, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is also a very big man, that's all." Just the Arya Samaji says in India, that "We don't accept Him as God, but He is a very big man, a very big politician, like that." So that is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad..., avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam, paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">paraṁ bhāvam,</span> what is the actual significance, that is, they do not know. What is the actual significance of the soul and soul platform, spiritual..., that they do not know. They are studying from the mental platform. So they have to go beyond mental platform, <span class="Italic">avāṅ mānasa-gocara,</span> beyond bodily mental platform. Then they will understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So we shouldn't bother with such tests?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> By submitting to them we're actually... We're endorsing that they are dealing with the spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they come first of all, you have to inform them that "We are working on the platform of the soul. What do you know about the soul?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This psychologist has become a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. He might have failed in his mental working in the mental plane. Then he has come. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But still he wants to try and prove Kṛṣṇa consciousness through this psychological testing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what he will prove, psychological...? Psychological means mental plane. How he will understand soul from the mental platform? That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> What they want to know is the effect of the, the effect on the mind of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Effect will be good. As soon as one is on the platform of the soul, the intelligence, mind, body, everything will be good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> That is what they are studying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is another thing. Just like if you get millions of dollars, ten dollars is already there. You haven't got to endeavor for ten dollars. Similarly, if one who is on the platform of soul... <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati</span> (<span class="calibre3">Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</span> 1.3)<span class="Italic">.</span> If you understand the platform of soul, then you understand the other platforms: the intellectual platform, mental platform, bodily platform. And platform of knowledge, <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa, parakṣa, aparakṣa, adhokṣaja, aprakṛta.</span> So <span class="Italic">aprakṛta</span> is this platform of the soul. Kṛṣṇa's activities, that is <span class="Italic">aprakṛta,</span> completely far beyond these material ideas, material platform. Material platform, <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa.</span> Just like you want to see the arrangement. That is <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa.</span> Then <span class="Italic">aparakṣa,</span> accepting the authority's version. <span class="Italic">Pratyakṣa, parakṣa.</span> Then <span class="Italic">aparakṣa,</span> then <span class="Italic">adhokṣaja,</span> beyond your mental speculation. Then <span class="Italic">aprakṛta,</span> spiritual. Spiritual platform is not understood by machine, material machine. Then what is the spiritual platform? Kṛṣṇa is understood not by machine. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti: [Bg. </span>18.55] "Through devotion only." So devotion is not machine. That is spiritual activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So you cannot understand the consciousness of a devotee by testing his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You cannot understand the consciousness of a devotee by testing his body or his mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, consciousness means... That is mental platform. Consciousness is also in different platform, bodily consciousness, mental consciousness, intellectual consciousness, then spiritual consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is spiritual consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So there is no way they can understand. No way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they will understand? First of all let them explain what does he mean by soul? That they cannot explain. They take mind as the ultimate, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. And they see whether or not the mind is moving like this or like this or like this or like that, and then they have a gauge which says, "This is perfect." So they're seeing... They're judging whether or not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we say, "Any position on the mental platform, it is all nonsense." <span class="Italic">Mano-rathena sato dhavato bahiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the mind of a devotee is based on the activities of his spiritual practices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind of a devotee is upon Kṛṣṇa. So what they will understand, that mind is in Kṛṣṇa? What they will understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So according to different transcendental emotions, the mind will be agitated or calm or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not mind. It is spirit soul. You also do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual platform is different. But the spiritual activities expressed through mind, through body, through intelligence. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. So that will bewilder them, this expression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This expression through the..., it will bewilder them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> See, the materialist is seeing that everyone is agitated, so the goal in their life is cessation of that agitation. They want to merge or cease their existence. They want to go into nothingness. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> ...this is what they're looking for. The transcendental meditator goes in so that the gauge doesn't make any motion. But a rock, if you put that same gauge on a rock it also doesn't make motion. Does that mean the rock is spiritual or that he's more advanced than someone else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> You see? They're saying that perfection is no motion. They're saying that perfection is inactivity. So they already have in their mind what they think is perfect, and then they're going to see if this method helps a person to achieve calmness or whatever they're calling perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is that Buddha philosophy, <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa,</span> stop all activities. Buddha philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So someone who's actually following the scientific method, when he comes up to these bewildering conclusions about a devotee, he will be forced to inquire into the spiritual consciousness? Therefore we might be able to say this is a bona fide thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because they are bewildered-they will see the conclusions, they are bewildered-they will then have to inquire further, "Well, why is this? Why is this?" They will have to come to the spiritual platform to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Therefore we can make the devotees through this...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> But they're bewildered already. They don't need to look at their graphs to become bewildered. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But they don't think they're bewildered, so that's the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Well, when they see their graphs, they still may not think they're bewildered. They may make the conclusion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, they even admit they're bewildered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The reply was given by Socrates. He was condemned to death. So the judges inquired, "Mr. Socrates, what kind of grave you will like?" So he answered, "First of all, catch me. Then talk of grave." (laughter) So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not on the spiritual platform, so all their studies are useless. They are studying with a pre-concept idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Right. So that when you don't fit into their preconceived idea...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is called, in logic it is called <span class="Italic">prititio principia(?).</span> So it is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In our movement, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have that group of scientists who are preparing that book, <span class="Italic">The Origin of Life,</span> but will they actually be able to prove anything through that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Will they actually be able to prove anything by scientific presentation or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is science. If you can prove it by experiment. Otherwise, it is not science, theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But how can they prove the existence of the soul through experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all let them prove by chemical composition they can produce life. Then we shall talk of soul. First of all let them, in the laboratory, let the chemicals be mixed up and produce a small ant. Then we shall understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> We don't need to make experiments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They can make these little amoebas but they can't make ants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Amoebas, that is automatically... By perspiration it comes out. There are four sources of life: <span class="Italic">udbija, jarayuja, svedaja,</span> and, what is other? <span class="Italic">Andaja. Andaja</span> means life comes from the egg. That is called <span class="Italic">andaja</span>. And life comes from, under certain circumstances... Just like trees, grass. It is called <span class="Italic">udbija</span>. And then <span class="Italic">jarayaja,</span> just like we human beings or animals, they come from the embryo. And <span class="Italic">svedaja</span>. And some living entities come out from perspiration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So they were saying in this experiment they made that they completely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four kinds of generating process is there. So what they have studied? That germs come out perspiration, that is already accepted in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Under certain circumstances the germs come by, what is called? Scientific name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like bugs, bed bugs. Due to your perspiration of the body, the bed being unclean, they come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the capability was already there in like seed, and you just watered it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So when they said they created life in this laboratory experiment, the capability...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that also they cannot do. That also they cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But the capability was there and they just watered it. They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the capability?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There was one of these four circumstances for life in that test...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Potency, that is potency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yeah. And they just made the circumstance proper so that life came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That is their big thing on the path to becoming God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the time being, let them be kicked by the God's servant, that's all. Then some day they will become God. For the time being, let them be kicked. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually the whole field of psychology is going towards yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yoga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because they are trying to become calm and peaceful and control their body for long periods of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The car is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The car is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So we went to a convention two weeks ago, and they were all doing their scientific experiments, and they were trying so many different methods to enjoy sex life and be happy, and then the last day we had a big <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> for two and a half hours. And all of these people who were so frustrated by all of their other methods came, psychologists and professors and chairmens of department, and little old ladies, and they were all jumping up and down in ecstasy for two and a half hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And they said, "Oh, this is the best process. Because this is joyful realization." They said, "You people really have something here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in that way, if they understand, that is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That seemed to be the only way they'll understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> So that's more effective than making some experiments and bringing them some graphs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Also they loved <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That they are realizing, that how these hippies, they have given up everything, and they are now enjoying <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> That they are realizing. Because they know most of our devotees coming from the hippie community. So they are surprised, "How the hippies they have given up everything and they're enjoying <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana?"</span> That is already their problem, another, that "There must be something." Therefore these big, big professors study. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...one place in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> where Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja says that "You mental speculators, put your speculation to Caitanya Mahāprabhu." He says something like that. If you were to speculate, speculate about Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the greatness of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think there is anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Maybe I'm misquoting.</div>

But Kavirāja Gosvāmī says, "Compare with the contribution of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then you will be surprised." Oh! Just like they became surprised, immediately, "Oh, this is the nicest." That is stated by Kavirāja Gosvāmī, that "The merciful contribution given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu-compare with any other contribution of the world, scientist, physiologist and this and that.

They've gone to Buddhist monks and various people that are into voidism, and they've made these tests, and it comes out that there's no activity. So they're seeing this as being the goal. They're trying to see if the same perfection, result of perfection, is achieved by the chanting. They already have a preconceived notion of what perfection is, and if they're testing to see if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To that standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yeah, if we're up to that standard of perfection of the Buddhist monks or the Zen monks or transcendental meditators or whatever. So I think it's a very bad thing to take part in that thing.</div>

Is there any... Why they cannot do it? Why do they say it is chemical? Chemical you have got in your possession. So inject the dead child and it will grow, then it is correct. And where is that? Simply bogus propaganda. And we have to accept it? Either they must say that "Yes, it is chemical, but we did not find that chemical."</div>
