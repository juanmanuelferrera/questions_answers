<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...and they are drunkards, and they are <span class="Italic">guṇḍās,</span> and they are creating trouble always." "Oh, then why not preach amongst them?" You see? This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's preaching. Hard nut. To accept a hard nut and make it soft. [break] ...who was injured, but His decision to deliver these persons was executed. So why should we neglect China and Russia? China has good relationship now with America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So American gentlemen, doing, to do some business, I think there will be no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "We are not going to preach any Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are going to do some business of our books. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> China they can do books and incense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a Spiritual Sky sales representative or looking into the possibilities of manufacturing incense in China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we have got now documents how our books are important. So therefore we want to introduce. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How our books are imported?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because we have got so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Important. Oh, important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Also you can tell them we're going to import things to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We could tell them we want to import incense from China to America. They will like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You are going for export and import. We want to export books, import incense. On this plea, exchange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That is how the Westerners originally entered China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And similarly, you have got already some inquiries from booksellers from Russia. On that plea-he is also sales organization-do something there. We have got philosophy, books, approved by learned circles. There is good chance. Our Trivikrama Mahārāja reported. He went to that Formosa? Trivikrama?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Taiwan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You went there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The report was the men there were very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes, they were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is by propaganda that "Russians are bad," "Chinese are bad." No. Nowhere the people are bad. Simply the leaders are bad. The men, they are all the same everywhere, everywhere, human nature.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It might be necessary to edit the books because in these countries when they start reading about God and how we say this government is rascal, rascal, this and that, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you think it is necessary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be necessary when there will be criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Later on, but at the present moment they have shown interest in our books, so we'll give it the way it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we can correct. There is no.... [break] ...is very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa(?):</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I met you in Mexico? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> No, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Bombay last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Two years ago in India I was here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is one good point. His father is the president of the biggest liquor company in the world, and he has his offices, I think, in China also. He goes to China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Hong Kong. He has been to trade fairs in Peking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we are going for trade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> Kṛṣṇa's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa captured him, (laughs) that "You come to China. You'll be successful." And when you will ask me, I shall go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Among the higher, to speak among the higher circle, philosophical, I'll go immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jagad-guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...to change your dress like gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's not difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of you become as gentlemen, American gentlemen. <span class="Italic">Kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya.</span> Everyone. <span class="Italic">Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] We shall talk on the philosophy, or distribution of equal wealth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, don't quote. Then they will drive you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You talk on reasonable ground, that "You are in favor of giving everyone the same facility. So what do you mean by 'everyone'? Why you are selecting only your countrymen? Why? 'Everyone' means every living being." So what is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we agree to spread communism all over the world, and we'll give everyone equal rights.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So equal rights, why not to the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, they're not as important, they'll argue. They'll say that they're not as important. They're not so intelligent. They're just animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animals, but it appears to me that there are many men like animals, so why you are giving facility to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because they can be elevated to the point of being men again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So elevate them to the right point. Elevate them. You are elevating them only on the platform of eating, sleeping, mating. That is there in the animal. So you have to talk this philosophy. Our philosophy is that expanded-not only human being but animals also. Our philosophy is, if there is one lizard in your room, I should see that he is not starving. This is our philosophy. Not only human being but animals, even an insect. We supply little sugar in the holes of the ant. That is our philosophy. We take any living being is the..., has the same propensity for eating, sleeping. So your economic problem is that "Supply sufficient eating, sleeping." So why not these animals? We have to speak on that platform, that our philosophy is so perfect that we do not neglect even an ant. Make this philosophy. "Why you are limiting within a country or within the human society? Expand it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Prabhupāda, the Chinese don't neglect ants either. They eat them. The Chinese don't neglect the ants either. They eat everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do they protest when they are eaten by others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> (aside:) You'll have to add to the regular cooks...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> The greatest difficulty in our preaching in Chinese will not be their receptiveness but our inability to see them as living beings rather than seeing them as Chinese. The Americans.... In a sense, anybody who is in the bodily conception at all is going to see them as Chinese rather than living beings, so we'll have a tendency to be prejudicial from the very beginning, think of them as very low. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't think anyone as low.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, so this will be difficult for the preachers, to see them not as Chinese but as actually Kṛṣṇa's servants too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, our devotees will not see like that. Our devotees will not see like that. [break] ...<span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ. Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> A <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> is <span class="Italic">sama-darśī.</span> He does not see anyone as low or high. That is <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> There is a verse in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> "One who sees Me in everything and everything in Me..." What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is wanted. Chinese Communist philosophy, does anybody know? What is that? What philosophy? They have got some philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They're emphasizing industrial development. Everyone, the entire country, is mobilized for developing industry, economic benefits, so everyone can enjoy nice material life under...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is the philosophy of the Western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Actually there is.... There is two factions in the Chinese schools now. One is saying to.... They're both materialistically based, but one is trying to stay on a position of self-sufficiency economically and not take from other countries or even trade, and the other school is to industrialize. And they're always fighting with their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, there are two schools?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> And the school who is more for self-sufficiency in agriculture, they also have brought out the.... In the last eight years or so they've brought to the surface more spiritual ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So there is a section who'll support.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who can support our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to capture them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They are more of a mystic yogi sort of school, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is also yoga, to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Actually that's Mao's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> If their main leader, Mao Tse Tung.... He's more of that school, but there are.... They call them revisionists. They say they're like the Russians, and that they're just.... They're always attacking them for wanting to copy the West. It's their same attack. They attack the Russians for becoming capitalists. They're puritan. They're trying to have pure communism. They have very great ideals, and the other school wants.... They think that they want to get in on the action of the trade and industrialization. But they are actually about equal in power. It's interesting. Right now, actually, it's very hard to get into China because there's a new feud that has come to the surface. There's top leaders that have been taken through the streets, denounced as being materialists, and they've taken their clothes from their wives' closets with mink coats and fancy clothes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all.... We shall first of all try to sell our books without any discussion. "As trade..., as trade representative, we have come. See our book." Go to the professors, go to the.... "We have got this support," like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> As Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Only for selling book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Like Satsvarūpa's men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...they accept our books, that means gradually they are accepting our philosophy. Not immediately talk about philosophy. Just ordinary bookseller, you have come. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Trojan horse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> In their schools right now, their colleges, is a center of controversy, education. The one school of thought who are called revisionists-they are compared to the Russians-they say that the schools should be centered almost entirely upon economic development and technology, and that philosophy, Communist philosophy, different.... In other words, different debates or thinking more, philosophically inclined people are rejected, so that now there is a fight between whether or not the schools will be centered simply for economic development or whether they're going to be centers of what they call revolutionary activities, thinking, trying to improve their Communist understanding and Communist ideology and more philosophically inclined. So those who are pushing for greater economic development at the expense of their Communist purity or their philosophical understanding, they are now being attacked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> As far as trade goes, actually Hong Kong belongs to China. It's on lease to the British government. The lease expires in twenty years or so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Eight years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Eight years. But the thing is, it's difficult for them to assume or take part in Hong Kong because it represents something like several million capitalists, which they have no use for in their country. For thirty years they've been training people in Communism. Their whole culture is centered around that Chinese language. Our books are in English, but their whole culture is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Our Chinese <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is coming out. It should be ready in two weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not our policy that the whole country will be on our side. That is not.... At least some of them may be interested. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yaśodānandana Mahārāja says that the Chinese <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is ready for publication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's at the printer. It will be ready in two weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Another interesting thing about China is because they have such a huge population, in order to feed the population they've had to turn to production of agricultural products rather than meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the only way. That is the only way. If you want to make them happy.... That we are preaching in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Produce grains. Everyone will eat nicely, and they will be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not only are they increasing grains, but because it's so much more economical to produce grains than to produce animals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...they are largely vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's a largely vegetarian country out of necessity, which may be good for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So as soon as you find some hold, you can ask our Revatīnandana Mahārāja also to come there. [break] ...accept that we have come to sell books. To see the bookseller, to see the professors, to see.... That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> My passport is already like a businessman. I already.... I was thinking to do this for a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore it was burst out last night. Do it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> ...the statement by the leader, they put out this manifesto or something. He said that the boys should not get married until twenty-five years old, and that they should remain celibate and that they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chinese people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. And they're very strong on celibacy because he said that the.... If a person loses semen or if they masturbate or if they unnecessarily use their sexual energy, they'll go insane. Their brains will become very weak, and physically they'll become very weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> In their philosophy, in their basic philosophy of life, the Chinese are very conservative, and they're called Puritan. They're described by the Western countries as the most Puritan country in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I think this philosophy, no illicit sex, will be very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. They'll very much appreciate that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you explain scientifically as you are explaining, that "This will spoil the brain, you cannot take nice things, so you must observe these rules..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Part of their culture is basically.... It's deeply steeped in what's called Taoism, and it's.... An important part of that is retaining the semen for mental power. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give them attention, yes, even at the..., as far as possible. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It may be possible for Dhṛṣṭadyumna's father to employ himself and myself in that business. Then I can go...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...as their sales representative and at the same time be a representative for books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...because they already can go into China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> The Chinese are very afraid of the Russians, and they are afraid of the Russians in India. They are afraid of Russian-style communism in India, and Russians having bases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> A way of preaching is that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness and Vedic communism is the only thing in India that would ultimately defeat the Russian-style communism. Then they would very much appreciate it. If they saw that India would go communist, then they'd rather have it Vedic communist than Russian communist. Their theory is that everybody must go communist for people to be, feel satisfied. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That's their feeling.</div>
