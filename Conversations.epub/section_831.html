<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I was a child my father gave me one red gun, and then I was not more than eight years. Then, after getting one, I said, "I must have another one." Eh? Then father said, "Why another one? You have got already one." So I said, "No, I have got two hands. I must have two guns." Then my father, "No, you are not.... I am not going..." Then I made so much agitation, he was obliged to give me two guns. (laughter) I was very pet child of my father and very pet son-in-law also. And I am very pet guru also. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is Hanumān <span class="Italic">jayantī</span> today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Today is also the <span class="Italic">rāsa-yātrā</span> of Balarāmajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">rāsa-yātrā.</span> Oh. So you have some festival?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, they have got the festival in the <span class="Italic">Rāma-mandira.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We're having a bigger festival in our <span class="Italic">mandira.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also it is the appearance day of Śyāmānanda Gosvāmī and Vaṁśī-vadana Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many stories still remain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Three. Three on top. The towers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> Prabhupāda <span class="Italic">ki jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> Fine, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom you are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> From Rome and Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> Bhagavān took real good care of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is your wife?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> She is here, Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's going to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. He is very good boy. [break] ...that these people are coming for Indian culture, and government is restricting, "Don't come here. Don't come here." We are so degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are frightened of the American CID's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may frighten. A rascal may be frightened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Americans are all rascals, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> What is the cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then what is the cause? No, what is the cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government (Hindi) They have admitted in the Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> They are frightened in the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think they are very slow to act.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the real is that all rogues are in the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, that is the right thing. Not only rogues...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you, if you are actually serious, why don't you make propaganda in the country that "Please do not give vote to the rogues." Don't mention any party. "If you want to be happy, then don't give vote to the rogues." And who is a rogue? The illicit sex hunters, the intoxicants, and the meat-eaters, and the gamblers. These are rogues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are all there in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you don't mention any. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So it is impartial. And actually, if they test that "Whether this man I am voting, he is free from all these sinful activities?" Then, you see, the whole face of the Indian government will change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, I may tell you, the adults.... That change is meant for the educated, cultured, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you don't name that educated, cultured. You simply say that "You vote for this person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> People vote for five-rupee notes. They don't vote anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they will suffer. Then don't, don't complain. Don't complain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was a political worker myself and a member of the ruling party and a member of the assembly. I know how they collect votes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you.... For five rupees if you sacrifice your sacred right, then how can you expect good government?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they never desired to have these rights. They should be disenfranchised, those who will not understand their responsibility towards their country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at least you can make some propaganda that "Don't give votes to these persons." Don't name any. Then he will be envious. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You will be in the jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't mind going to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you preach these moral principles, nobody will object. Nobody will object.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are shamming themselves as big moralist. They go to temples and what not and what not and what not. And then they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still in India they will never accept a drunkard as moralist. Still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, all of them are drunkards, who are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Majority, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mass of people, they are not drunkard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not mass, I mean those people who are in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They? They are not majority. Therefore we have to reform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Only God will reform them by giving them.... They should be chastised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are being chastised, but they are so fool, they cannot understand they are being chastised. Just like a dog is being chastised. He cannot have eating, eatables, whole day and night, eating stool. Somebody's stoning, somebody's sticking, and still, he is very jubilant: "<span class="Italic">Gow, gow, gow, gow,</span> I am very happy." (laughter) This is going on. So this dog's association, dog society, they are suffering in every step; still, they are thinking, "We are making progress." That's all. Dog civilization. Hog civilization. Dog civilization. This is not civilization. <span class="Italic">Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Dog civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, this civilization is degrading because of the cinemas and things. The mothers are the really...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you do not know. Cinema is not cause. Cause is godlessness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But because the godlessness starts from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who are the ideals of these women? The cinema actresses. Who were the ideals of our mothers? Sāvitrī and Sītā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many, so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is very important. This is very important, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are many cinemas in America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, one percent. But many cinemas are there. I have not seen. The people say so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see, when a man is diseased there are many symptoms of ailments. You cannot say.... You are a physician. You know. You cannot say, "This is the cause of the disease." It is.... Real, one disease is there, and there are so many ailments. So you cannot say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>You mean the cause of the cause of the cause is godlessness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Symptoms are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Cause of the cause of the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These are only outward...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are.... In logic there are two causes: immediate cause and remote cause. So remote cause is taken into consideration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The important cause is the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Vijaya Datta(?) is interested for <span class="Italic">gurukula.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not construct a big building for <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> here? The students will be trained up to come here and sporting, having nice bath and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and build up their character. And in Bombay you will get many children, because there are so many rich men. They are not so much concerned to make their children technologist. If they get good education and character, they will give. Technologists they can purchase. Birla, they are not going to be technologist. They purchase technologist. I have seen in many respectable Marwari house. They don't send their children to school. They don't send.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> After matriculation they go to the office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No matriculation. They engage good <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> good teachers, and teach them at home, and, as soon as they are able to read and write and see accounts, immediately engage in the business. They know that "We can purchase technologist. Why shall I waste time for so-called education, Ph.D., D.A.C.?" You have seen that Ph.D. in our Vṛndāvana? Useless. So many Ph.D.'s are useless. Cannot earn their livelihood. I have seen. So what is the use? <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta.</span> Because one has become.... I have seen one Ph.D. chemist in Allahabad. He could not get any job. Then he was manufacturing soap at home and taking it in cycle and going to the market just like ordinary coolie. These so-called educationists, unless they get a good job, they are useless street dog. Useless. They cannot earn even livelihood. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "Don't try for these things, to increase your economic position. This is already destined. You cannot increase or decrease. Whatever you are destined, you must get it. Try to get Kṛṣṇa consciousness."</div>
<div class="Verse">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido<br class="calibre2"/>na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kālena sarvatra gabhīra raṁhasā<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"> You'll get. As you get miserable condition of life-you don't like it but it comes-similarly, happy condition will also come according to your destiny. Why you are wasting time for this? This is the decision of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> You cannot change your destiny. If you have to be, have to work like a coolie, even after becoming Ph.D. you'll have to work like a coolie. You cannot change it. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> This is.... Therefore formerly any man was satisfied in any position. They were not trying to develop economic condition, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. She is your daughter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido<br class="calibre2"/>na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kālena sarvatra gabhīra raṁhasā<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">(aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span> (Hindi) Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is such a man. He has all the characteristics of a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> in the home. He is a multi-millionaire's son. But absolutely untouched by wealth, and very fine man, extremely fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If our <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> children comes here they can have very good sporting. And this idea I have given you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Remain healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twice a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Twice a day can come, take bath and enjoy sporting life and then chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take good <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That's all. Why they should waste their time in technology to become a coolie?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Actually there was once a case. A newspaper once wrote that Henry Ford was ignorant. So Henry Ford filed a case against the newspaper. So in the hearing, the defense asked so many questions about science and history to Henry Ford. So Henry Ford said to the judge that "In my office I have a panel of buttons, and I can press any button and someone will come running to answer any of these questions. So am I ignorant?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When Mr. Ford comes willing, back on...? Is he coming back again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are many. There are many. Now, you see, near Delhi there is Modi Nagar. That Mr. Modi was not very educated man, but how he has developed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is employing something like fifty thousand people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Hindi) Mr. Modi near Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Modinagarawala.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is employing fifty thousand people, without any education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We had a very big program in Modinagara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife received us very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Very cultured people. My cousin's daughter is married to his nephew, Modinagarawala. He's a big architect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, Modi, he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This Modi, is, I mean, an industrialist, but his nephew, an architect.... My niece was studying in London, and she married with him in England. Intercommunal marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> I have seen in Miami Beach that one man was found dead in his apartment, and he was living poverty-stricken. His whole place was full of rats and cockroaches. When they investigated his file they found that he had eight million dollars in the bank and in stocks. But all of his friends said he couldn't spend one penny his whole life, because he was too cheap. So even though he was a rich man, actually he was a poor man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But, sir, there are some beggars here in Bombay who have got one and two <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees. You have read the railway(?) story about couple of beggars. They rounded up, and they had money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am also a beggar. I am also beggar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is not.... You are a rich beggar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Millions of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsīs</span> don't touch money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I don't touch money. They pass check. (laughter) I simply sign check. All these accounts in Bombay, they are being managed by them. I do not touch even. <span class="Italic">Lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees they are spending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Begging is prohibited, so they rounded up the beggars sometime back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I tell him this way. Just give books. Transcendental fraud, that we give, say, fifty rupees' worth book, and we draw 2222. <span class="Italic">Buddhir yasya balaṁ tasya nirbuddhes tu balaṁ kutaḥ.</span>(?)Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> You know that story? Eh? You know that story, <span class="Italic">buddhir yasya balaṁ tasya</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "The man who has got the <span class="Italic">buddhi</span> is a strong man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. <span class="Italic">Paśya siṁho madonmataḥ śaśaḥ kena nipatitaḥ.(?)</span> This is <span class="Italic">Hitopadeśa</span> story. You know this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I don't know this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a lion in the forest, and he was disturbing all the animals. So there was a peace conference: "Sir, you don't disturb every one of us. We shall come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Eka eka</span>.... (Hindi) "We shall come automatically." So one day it was the turn of a rabbit. So he was a little late, so the lion, "Why you are late? My time is over." "Yes sir, another lion in the way, he wanted to eat me. So I said, 'No, you cannot eat me. I will be eaten by such and such Mr. Lion.' " So he became very..., "Who is that?" "Yes, come on. I will show you." So he got him near a well, and he said that "Here is the lion." So immediately, (growls) "Aww!" (laughter) And there was sound, "Aww!" Then he saw the photo, I mean, the reflection, and immediately jumped over.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">A <span class="Italic">śaśa,</span> the rabbit, killed a big lion by intelligence. The <span class="Italic">Aesop's Fable</span> was imitated from this <span class="Italic">Hitopadeśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, all are translated more or less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">Hitopadeśa</span> was written by Viṣṇu-śarmā. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...<span class="Italic">Upaniṣad,</span> in sixth or seventh chapter, he says that even <span class="Italic">bala</span> is.... I mean <span class="Italic">buddhi</span> is not stronger than <span class="Italic">bala.</span> He described like that. (Hindi) Strong man is like that, they have described. That is what.... That is there in <span class="Italic">Chāndogya Upaniṣad.</span> It was just sort of a story</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Concerning the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> system, after a child attains a certain age...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No age. As soon as he is able to walk, he can be admitted. What is the wrong there? If he comes to the sea and takes bath and jumps, it doesn't require any age. Any four-year, five-year-old child can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> When he becomes, say, twenty years old, though, when he becomes older...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all begin. Then we shall think of old. But.... At least when he is older, he will not become a nonsense. That.... We want to save him from becoming a nonsense. That is our duty. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Brahmacārī gurukule vasan dāntaḥ.</span> When the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is residing in <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> he must be trained up how to control senses. That is the first education. People are spoiled because they are not trained up to become controller. That is the defect of the modern age. And when one is unable to control senses, he will do all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Vṛndāvana the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> children went to the Yamunā for two days. Even though it was a forty-five minute walk one way, they enjoyed it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they'll enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was a very nice procession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And they're doing it every day now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...intelligence and <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>'s executive power and <span class="Italic">vaiśya's</span> productive capacity and <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> labor. This combined together makes the whole society perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How this social order can be generated in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (to passerby:) Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>'s duty is that everyone is religious. It doesn't matter whether he follows Muslim or.... That is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>'s duty, not that to discriminate, "The Hindu religion is better than the Muslim religion. Muslim..." That is not the way. If everyone is religious, it doesn't matter whether he is Hindu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No religious Muslim would have ever done harm to Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These are also ruled, these Mullahs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore one.... The government's duty is to see that everyone is actually religious and moral. It doesn't matter if he follows some type of religion. [break] ...to discriminate that "Hindu religion is good, Muslim religion is..." Then you cannot act as king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All religion are of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have not been able to find out any difference between the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> and the Christianity. I have studied so thoroughly both of them. Actually Jesus Christ has taught nothing but <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Still, the Christians, when they came here, these Portuguese, converted these people to Christians. They are fanatics. They are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are doing.... They are doing in their own countries. In France the Roman Catholics and the Protestants, they are fighting and cutting each other's head. And still going on, it is. This is fanaticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Political fanaticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, and said Sītā was a prostitute. I don't know.... And still, the government could, I mean, support them. It's too much of a joke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these.... You cannot.... Even on religious principle or so-called religion, you cannot make equality. The rogues will always remain, either Hindu, Muslim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You know that Naikar(?) last year. [break] Secular means you respect all religions. That is the definition of secularism. They mean, secularism means no religion. They are fools. You can call them rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we rascals vote them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, sir. What man, rascals, vote them? It is the hutment fellows who bring them because they are in majority. I have never been elect to, I mean my candidate. Every time my vote goes useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you or your brother votes; somebody is elected. People are degenerated; therefore they do not know whom to vote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are what, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Degenerated. They do not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Degenerated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They vote five-rupees notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is degeneration. For five-rupee notes he is giving his valuable vote to anybody. That is degeneration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why we really.... We are not for this type of Western type of democracy. We should have <span class="Italic">Rāma-rājya,</span> a benevolent dictatorship of a good king, a religious king like Rāma. That should be the ideal condition for this country. This way, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our buses are bigger than this, I think. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is a Matadar Campo(?), no? This is a Matadar Campo(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> [break] ...Deities with Acyutānanda Swami. He's going to travel down South India as soon as he's finished...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, very nice. Better Gaura-Nitāi. Gaura-Nitāi is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But Acyutānanda was explaining that people in South India don't accept Gaura-Nitāi so much as Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, all right. (end)</div>
