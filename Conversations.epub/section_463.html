<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> ...that we all, when we are in material life, we have so many duties, so many works, so many things to do, but then, when she's dead, she wants peace for herself. She wants to be... She has this peaceful situation, wants to be situated in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone will get that peace? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She thinks that everyone will get after death this peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The cats and dogs, everyone? The same? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> [break] ...different from cats and dogs in as much as he has something spiritual in himself, and she says if this spiritual is more emotions and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that difference? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Cats and dogs are animals, and they don't have, animals, they don't have any spiritual life. They live more after instincts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if the man and animal is working for the same purpose... Just like man is eating, and the animal is also eating. A man is sleeping, and the animal is also sleeping. The man is also having sexual intercourse, and the animal also doing that. And man is also fearful of his enemy, and the animal also fearful of enemies. So if the platform of activities are the same, why the difference is there? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says that the difference is that the men does all these activities with his mind and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the activity is the same, eating. Where is the difference between these activities or that activities? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she said that the animals are doing their eating process through the roots, and the men, or the animals, she says, they do it instinct, like before, and the man does it with a spirit soul, this. She says that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I think the... When a man eats and the animal eats, either it is done by instinct or by intelligence, but where is the difference? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So her point is that man was former primitive, but he has developed by his intelligence, this advanced civilization, this, all this kinds of stuff, but the, but the bird or the animal, for instance, he was former primitive, and he is now primitive. So she says that is the evidence that man has some mind or intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he can build nice building, therefore he has got some intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the effect of building, that he builds according to his instinct, and you construct according to your intelligence, but the sleeping comfort is the same. (German) [break] ...such a nice building, and his enemy throws bomb on it. But the dogs, they do not do that. So who is advanced, the dog or the man? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yes she admits that the man by his intelligence, he makes something up which destroys ultimately. But the dog doesn't do, she says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The dog has no greater intelligence. Therefore he sleeps under some bush very comfortably. But man has made very nice building, and another man destroys it by bombing. So the dog's intelligence is better or the man's intelligence is better? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she says that the man, by his intelligence, will go on, go on inventing some things which will destroy, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is that very good intelligence? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she says that this intelligence is actually not good. She says this intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of getting better intelligence than the dog? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...like to have more, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She thinks that she doesn't want to answer to your point. She says that the man has got his intelligence by God, but he misuses his intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But God has given intelligence for this bad work? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says that God has not given this intelligence for this bad work, but that is due to the faulty mankind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore misuse of intelligence will cause his suffering. Now suppose a tiger kills an animal, and a man kills thousands of animals in a day in the slaughterhouse. Is he not sinful? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says that this is the evil in mankind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the conclusion is that the so-called intelligent man is simply misusing his intelligence. So when he misuses his intelligence he is less than the cats and dogs. Yes. (German) And then, after death, how he'll be in peace? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says that every man will get this peace, also the bad men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bad men also will get peace? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nonsense. (laughter) Just see. How nonsense philosophers they are! (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says that this is their... She's also on your side. She says that this would not be right if the bad men were to get the same thing as the good men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She said the bad man also will get peace. (laughs) (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So this lady's point is: where shall the bad man go after death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll become a dog. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says that this would mean that there is a hell. But she doesn't believe in hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may not believe, but hell is there. If... You read this book. <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ [Bg. </span>14.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Read this verse. Just see how misbelief, that there is no hell. Just see. In this way, misled, whole world. The so-called rascal leaders mislead, "There is no hell. Don't believe in hell." Vivekananda said, "Yes. There is no hell." <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvam.</span> And she is a philosopher? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says she is a primitive, simple man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still not willing to go to hell. (German) You found?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sattva-sthāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">(ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti) sattva-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>14.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets. Those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets, and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just... Translator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Pg. 666... Well, it's fourteen-eighteen. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> [break] ...where these hellish worlds are? She asks you where these hellish worlds are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're, they are different planets. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She wants to know how we know this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the books. (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she feels... It seems that she feels a little bit attacked by this hellish worlds. So now she says that Jesus has come to save men and not to, to destroy them. So he says Jesus even came to the robbers and with a purpose to save them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, but provided the follower abides by the order of Jesus. Jesus can save them if the man follows the Jesus order. (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> ...say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus has given some instruction or not? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So he says that Jesus has given some directions and this is that we should love our brother in the same way as we love ourselves and that we should not do any harm to anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Jesus has said also those who are sinful, they'll go to hell? Is it not? Satsvarūpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I can't think of any quote, but of course, that's the teachings of God the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yes, yes, she says that there is something like eternal condemn in the Christian teachings, like Jesus said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eternally hellish life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then why she says that everyone will go, peace? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She makes no... She said that if she could listen to Jesus, what he said, formerly, then she would know, but she says actually one cannot believe it so much because can anyone believe that he has made the dead Lazarus... This was a person who already died, and Jesus came and gave him life back. So she says nobody can believe that, that Jesus has made this dead Lazarus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't follow. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> She, from what he says, she does not actually believe in Jesus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This lady. She says that who can be sure of what Jesus actually did because he was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why, why she quotes Jesus? If she does not believe in Jesus, why she's giving evidence from Jesus? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says like if she makes a comparison like if today there is a car crash, then all the people will say something different and the information will differ from the original car crash. So she says, in the same way, what Jesus did and said is now twisted around so nobody can actually give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means everyone has rejected Jesus. (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> ...that what Jesus said, this is all right, but what is now made of it, this one shouldn't take wordly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She says what Jesus said is all right, but what is now existing from that, one should not take wordly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Literally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That which has been written down about his activities or his speaking cannot be accepted literally because who knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you quote? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she makes a difference what is true and what is not true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you, if you cannot follow Bible literally, then where is the truth? (German) [break] ...new truth. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she speaks of a fashion today, that there's a fashion going on, and she says this fashion is all right, and this fashion is that one takes all the miracles and all the mythological things out of the Bible, and one causes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no truth. It is all hodge-podge. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yeah, so she agrees on your point that everyone takes what he likes, and that she says is what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is a hodge-podge. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> So she again says that she cannot accept the points of the Bible where there is mention of miracles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> She again says that one cannot accept the portions of the Bible where there are statements...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, once she said that those things cannot be taken now literally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of taking Bible? (German) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu:</span> ...that one always has to take the truth from the untruth, also in Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nonsense. From untruth, how there can be truth? (end)</div>
