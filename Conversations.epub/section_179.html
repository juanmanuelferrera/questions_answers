<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will be visible in due course of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What he was telling me was that the table itself has a <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul, that the table is a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So that's what I was asking. 'Cause I said, "Does the table have a <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul?" I was trying to ask that question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span>That's what completely threw me off. I thought, "Oh..." That means the table is a person, this is a person, this is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A particular <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul was in that body. Then it is also proved that every <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul is individual. Although they are living combinedly, everything is individual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, doesn't... That's all right then. Now the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that one <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul was prominent. He was visible. Others were in dormant condition. This proves that every individual soul is separate from the other; still, they can remain together. Just like the sunshine, they create... a small shining particles, combined together, molecules. So everything is combined spirit particles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everything that we see around us, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. <span class="Italic">Sarvam idam khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> Everything is Brahman. But when they are covered, that is called material exis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Each <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just as sunshine is not covered, it is called cloudy. But this light, whatever light you are seeing, that is also sunshine. That is not different from the sunshine. And above the cloud, there is bright. So matter means when it is covered by something, it is matter. That covering is unconsciousness. That covering is also created of the sunshine, by the same energy. And then, by the same energy it is dissipated also. So the conclusion is living being, when it is covered by ignorance, that is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But this, the body itself is sort of a manifestation of ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When the ignorance is gone, then you have got spiritual body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Then I know that I am not this body. Then I know that I am not this body. Now, the question is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I am not ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Then there is some distinction, between the nature of the soul and the nature of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That distinction is inconceivable. You cannot make clear distinction. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">acintya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The distinction between the soul and the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything. We distinguish matter and spirit. That distinction is inconceivable by you. You cannot make a clear distinction. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">acintya bhedābheda tattva,</span> inconceivable one and different, simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> When you said that, once before, that the cells, all the cells in our body, each one is a living entity with a small body. Each one of those living entities covers itself with ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It takes a small body made out of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that body means ignorance. <span class="Italic">Śarīra avidyā jāla.</span> This body is nothing but a network of ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So then myself, I organize all these smaller cells. I organize them into my big body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, when you are covered, that is material. You try to understand. Covered by something. The same example. The sunshine is there, it is covered now. That covering also creation of the sunshine. So therefore the covering has no separate existence. Originally, the sunshine is everything. Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So how do I create matter that is my body? How do I create...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are creating. You are creating actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> By eating and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. By your energy you are creating. This body is my creation. Just like I am the soul, I am here within this body. So I cut my hair; it is again growing. I do not know how I am creating, but I am creating. My nail is growing-I am growing, I am creating. But I do not know. That is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Sometimes people ask...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These questions are not to be discussed in public. These are very higher understanding. For public should be, "This is matter, this is spirit." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, but one of the devotees asked me one time, "Why it is that when the body is dead that the fingernails continue to grow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. Never grows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Huh? They just play like that. And observe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It decomposes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But they say hair continues to come out sometimes from dead bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think you said once ... You answered that sometimes the fan turns a little bit after the plug.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. Mechanism, bodily mechanism has pulled the plug. That's what I said. Some material mechanism is still functioning like a machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has stopped, but maybe just like the fan is stopped, but still moving. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So there are many different manifestations of energies. It is the oneness that they're all Kṛṣṇa's energies. But there is also diversities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we say <span class="Italic">acintya bhedābheda.</span> You cannot clearly distinguish. It is one and different, at the same time. It is spirit and not spirit. You have to take it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Somehow or other, we create our own ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is like that. Everything is spirit but at the same time, not spirit. Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Everything is in Me, but I am not there." How is that everything is in Kṛṣṇa? How Kṛṣṇa is not there? He says like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. He says because you can't see Him there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore matter means when our consciousness is covered to understand Kṛṣṇa, that is matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I want to clear this up. Just like this table. It is full of millions of living entities, but there's not one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atom. Millions of atoms. But Kṛṣṇa says, "I am within the atom." So how you can say Kṛṣṇa is not there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Now you were also telling me that Kṛṣṇa is in the atom as the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not as plenary expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not as a plenary expansion, but a part of a plenary expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A plenary expansion that is also. <span class="Italic">Jīva</span> is also plenary expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Plenary? I thought plenary means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not plenary. That is also expansion. It is called <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa. Svāṁśa, vibhinnāṁśa. Viṣṇu-tattva</span> is <span class="Italic">svāṁśa</span> and <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa.</span> Both of them are part and parcel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Plenary means full portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So <span class="Italic">svāṁśa</span> is plenary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa</span> is part of plenary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So the presence of Kṛṣṇa in the atom, it is <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Both of them there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Both of them? In the atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Kṛṣṇa is not alone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whenever the Kṛṣṇa is there, the, everything must be there. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it says that He is present in every atom in His complete fullness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This brain will not accommodate. But as soon as the king is there you must know the king is with his ministers, secretaries, everything. How you can say the king is alone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You said also in the heart Kṛṣṇa is not alone. Every...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is never alone. With all paraphernalia, all Vaikuṇṭha paraphernalia. That is <span class="Italic">acintya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> But this body of a table, it's not an individual personality is it? There's not one <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul in charge of this table.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> In other words the table itself is not a person, but within there are many persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Living entities, germs, like that are in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And Kṛṣṇa is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is also... Everything is there. But actually, it is Kṛṣṇa, but we cannot see. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ.</span> The whole cosmic manifestation is Kṛṣṇa but it appears it is different from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ.</span> This is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda.</span> So unless we accept the thesis or philosophy expounded by Lord Caitanya, inconceivable one and different... Inconceivable. For us it is inconceivable. You cannot have any clear distinction. Therefore take it as inconceivable, <span class="Italic">acintya.</span> But from theoretical or by logical conclusion, everything is one: Kṛṣṇa. That's all. And another example is that the finger is myself, but I am not finger. This is the position. The hair I am. I am the hair, but I am not hair, at the same time. This is like that. This is called <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> inconceivable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> A related question also: just like there is at the same time the oneness is there, there is distinction, then, between the spirit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That distinction you cannot make clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I know. But still it's, not clear, but clear, there is some distinction, where a distinction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Distinction, there is distinction, there is no distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simultaneous. Now, which one will we accept? Therefore inconceivable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You can't accept one or the other; you have to accept them both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Everything is related in Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. But there's also, amongst the related things. There are related things because there is also diversity amongst them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's right. In preaching, in the movement, that there is no diversity between the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> souls who are living...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is diversity. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> They are saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmajyoti</span> is combination of <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul. And <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is emanation from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Brahmajyoti</span> is coming from Kṛṣṇa. This is a function. Heat is coming constantly, incessantly, from the fire. But still, heat is not fire. You cannot say heat is fire. Fire is far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's right. So the constitutional nature of the entities that naturally form <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is the same as the constitutional nature of the <span class="Italic">jīvātmās</span> that are forming the living entities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is comparison, a small spiritual spark. That's all. We are spark. So long it does not develop a body... That body is also the same. So it remains as spiritual spark. But because it is spirit, it cannot remain in that impersonal stage. He wants to enjoy. So, so long he has forgotten, he develops a body which is called matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Or else he develops a spiritual body? One or the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He is spirit, spiritual identity already. But as we are developing material body, similarly we can develop spiritual body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You very clearly explained to me once in a letter that if the spirit soul then goes into the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> he is considered still fallen. Still fallen. Does that means the whole <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is composed of fallen souls? You see my question? If I go there, I'm a <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul, and I go to the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> I'm still fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That means all <span class="Italic">jīva</span> souls there are also fallen souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That follows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Vibhinnāṁśa.</span> Separated parts. Separated parts, <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa.</span> You can call it fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But we usually think of fallen as being forgetful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is also forgetfulness. In the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> you are forgetful still. Because you are... That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra, anādhṛta yuṣmad anghrayaḥ. Anādhṛta.</span> They do not know how to adore the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That is forgetfulness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So they become separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the spiritual world, everything is composed of <span class="Italic">cintāmaṇi,</span> just like here everything is composed of atoms. So suppose someone develops a spiritual form in the spiritual sky. That form, I mean, that <span class="Italic">cintāmaṇi,</span> they are living entities also? Are they conscious entities or is that an expansion of the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul's own potency? Just like if someone develops the form of a boy, cowherds boy with Kṛṣṇa, is that an expansion of his potency, of that living spirit soul's potency?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you consider. That we imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's why I'm asking. Or like in this world, so many living entities are forming of one spiritual form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In one sense it is right. They are spiritual molecules. Yes. Here also, spiritual molecules, but here it is called material because there is no sense of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Forgetfulness. They are covered by ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The cowherd boy with Kṛṣṇa, he is also <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa</span> expansion. Correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But he's remembering. He is remembering, therefore he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may not remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, he's with Kṛṣṇa, he loves Kṛṣṇa. Therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like when cowherds boy were playing, they did not know Kṛṣṇa is God. They did not know. They did not care to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, but they love Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The love is there. When the love is there, that is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. And then they are not fallen. That is not fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They're not separated any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you should understand. Not that remembering or not remembering. Even in the spiritual world, they do not know that Kṛṣṇa is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The thing that was bothering me when I thought of this, that the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> if it is <span class="Italic">jīvas,</span> that they're all fallen souls, then I thought...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fallen anywhere. When Kṛṣṇa is forgotten, that is fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. But what I thought was just like in a room there is so many particles of light. Already inconceivable. And, then the whole <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is all fallen souls, and they become so inconceivable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not so fallen as they are in the matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. Separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But not in their constitutional position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're not as fallen as those who are in this material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's right. But still if they go there, they will sometimes come back here again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are not pure. They are not pure. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">. Aviśuddha. Aviśuddha</span> means not purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Are they less fallen because they are doing some service by lighting it up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is clearly stated: <span class="Italic">aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ. Aviśuddha. Buddhi</span> means intelligence, <span class="Italic">aviśuddha</span> means unclean, contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Unclean intelligence. So they realize...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think that they have become liberated, but <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says "No, it is not yet liberated." <span class="Italic">Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.</span> Still there is contamination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I see. It was just making my head spin to think of so many fallen souls. If there they also, to some extent they also fall. Here there are so many fallen souls. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ananta.</span> You cannot say how many. <span class="Italic">Ananta. Anantāya kalpate. Ananta</span> means unlimited number. There is no question of counting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Our brain is so tiny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">acintya.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">acintya,</span> inconceivable. (pause) Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Simply try to love Him. That is perfection. That's all. You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Nobody can understand. Kṛṣṇa Himself cannot understand Himself. Yes. (laughter) He's so <span class="Italic">acintya.</span> And what to speak of us. Therefore our only business: how to love Kṛṣṇa, how to serve Kṛṣṇa. That's all. That is perfection. You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Nobody can. Kṛṣṇa Himself cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The more we understand, the more we can convince others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Better you understand this, that you cannot understand. This understanding is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, but what I said is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "I cannot understand," this understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Then you have to give up. Then just simply love Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is real understanding, that "Kṛṣṇa cannot be understood. Simply let me love as far as possible, as I can, whatever is my, in my capacity." That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. But still, we deal with this philosophy for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. On the whole, as Kṛṣṇa says, we can understand that. That's all. You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa fully. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But even... Just like this book, this is for convincing people. This book is for convincing them to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, still, we understand better than them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is not understandable does not mean that we are also as fool as they are. Rather, Kṛṣṇa is so big that He is understandable even by us, and what to, about these rascals. What you can understand? We cannot understand. This should be the position, that "We are constantly serving Kṛṣṇa, we cannot understand Him. And what, rascal, you can understand?" The attitude should be taken like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We just accept whatever Kṛṣṇa says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's a fact and that's all. And we serve Kṛṣṇa. In the material sense, people try to understand a thing without, by inspecting it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without knowing his capacity. He has no capacity, still, he wants... And when he's caught that "You have no capacity," "No, I am trying. I am trying." He won't say that "I have no capacity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Or "I <span class="Italic">will</span> understand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I will understand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "In the future."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Obstinacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So we always try to understand as far as possible. And then when we don't understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far as we know from <span class="Italic">sādhu-guru-śāstra.</span> That's all. That is our understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. We can't extend it any further by our own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Don't try to extend also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Like that business about the soul in the table. I just completely changed everything we've done so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura said that "Whatever I heard from my guru, that is my life. That's all. Let me execute that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That was semantics. That was word usage. That's why we got confused. And now I can clear up the confusion I stirred up. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But I have one more question Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In our world here, there are material scientists and they understand things in a particular way. They understand, for instance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their way and our way is completely different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I know. But I mean, there must be... Suppose, on the heavenly planets, there must also be a class of men who understand things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Anywhere within this material world, they are all conditioned souls. Their understanding is incomplete. Even Brahmā. Even Brahmā. Brahmā has admitted in his prayers that people..."Other rascal may say that he has understood You, but for my part, I say I never understood You." He has said like that. Have you read this portion? So even Brahmā cannot understand. What we? He says, "The other rascals may say." Where is that <span class="Italic">Brahma-stotra?</span> In the first part, find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No. It's in the Process of Creation isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. In Kṛṣṇa Book. Where is that...? This is second part. I say always that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Second part?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Volume Two. No, no. It is not in Volume Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's in Volume One, when Brahmā kidnaps the cowherd boys. When I went to Paris, they had gotten all confused. Someone was thinking that Brahmā, Lord Brahmā is not a pure devotee, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In one sense, not. In one sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> By his behavior sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, behavior... Because he is in the material world, he wants to lord it over. But a pure devotee has no such desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But at the same time, he appeared as Ṭhākura Haridāsa in this world. So Brahmā, he appears as Ṭhākura Haridāsa with Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Brahmā, it does not mean Brahmā cannot be pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Does he become a pure devotee? Otherwise how he can see Kṛṣṇa and reveal <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā?</span> Also he's the head of our disciplic succession. That's why I said, "No. He's a pure devotee." How can he be the head of our disciplic succession if he's not a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He says, "My dear Lord, people may say that I am the master of all Vedic knowledge and I am supposed to be the creator of this universe. But it has been proved that I cannot understand Your personality, even though You are present before me just like a child. You are playing with Your boyfriends, calves and cows, which might imply that You do not even have sufficient education. You are appearing just like a village boy carrying Your food in Your hand and searching for Your calves, and yet there is so much difference between Your body and mine that I cannot estimate the potency of Your body. As I have already stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> Your body is not material." He says, "Even though You are standing before me, I cannot..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He says, "Even though You are present before me just like a child, I cannot understand." So people they think they understand it only when God is nowhere near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the position. Even Brahmā cannot understand; what we can understand? So without bothering ourself... <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam. Jñāne prayāsam</span> means endeavor to understand. <span class="Italic">Namanta,</span> give up this practice. <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapasya namanta eva.</span> Just become submissive. Submissive means that "We cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Simply let us serve." That's all. And develop your dormant love. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Is that why Kṛṣṇa also says to Arjuna, He says, "What need is there of all this..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa also, He says to Arjuna, "What need is there of all this knowledge? Just know that with one spark of My splendor I am pervading everything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. How He is doing that, it is very difficult to know. (pause) <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapasya namanta eva san-mukharitaṁ bhavadīya-vārtāṁ jīvanti.</span> [break] ...in temple you'll have to sleep. Yes. So also keep it in mind that unless there are four, five devotees experienced, we should not center, open a center. Because alone he becomes polluted. Without any association, he thinks otherwise and becomes fallen down. That which has happened to Kṛṣṇa dāsa. When he was alone, he could not manage. There was debts and he became disgusted. You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What about, Prabhupāda, in Germany, I have, like for instance, in Munchen, in Munich...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, must be two, three men; otherwise don't open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, there are two, three men, but I visit them regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Visit. Keep them alive. "Simply because we have opened a center, the business is finished." No. You must keep them alive. Alive means this morning class must go on, evening class must go on, there must be regular program for <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution. Busy. That is alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And they must also study your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise, so many Indian temples or churches, they think, "The church is there; everything is finished." No. Why people are losing interest in church? There is no preaching. Neither do they know what is preaching. They simply think that "This building will attract people." So they are now on sale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> In Calcutta it was like that. Everywhere we attract people with the Deity worship, but we hold them with the lectures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Come on. So how you were allowed to enter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śivānanda:</span> Oh, it was all right. No difficulty. No difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last time you had difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śivānanda:</span> No. Last year it was all right also. But before that it was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before that. So what news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śivānanda:</span> Nice place in Heidelburg. Kṛṣṇa gave us a very nice temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your health is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śivānanda:</span> My health is fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. You are the pioneer of European activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śivānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Montreal, you were pushed. Yes. And from San Francisco, Gaurasundara was pushed to Hawaii. (chuckles) So Śivānanda Prabhu was also pushed from Montreal. So Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased. And Sudama was pushed to Japan. Now, anyway, that pushing has not become unsuccessful. (end)</div>
