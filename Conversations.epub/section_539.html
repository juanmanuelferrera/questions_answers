<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...any language, you should submit, and you should feel that, that "I am worthless. My Guru Mahārāja has given this chance to serve Kṛṣṇa, to offer Kṛṣṇa... My Lord, I am worthless. I have no capacity to serve You. But on the order of my Guru Mahārāja, I am trying to serve You. Please do not take any offense. Accept whatever I can do. That's all. That is my request." That <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is sufficient. Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yo me bhaktyā prayacchati.</span> Kṛṣṇa never said that "One who offers Me with Sanskrit <span class="Italic">mantra." Yo me bhaktyā prayacchati.</span> Real thing is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> feeling: "How to serve Kṛṣṇa? How to please Him?" That is wanted. Not to see that you are a very good scholar in speaking in Sanskrit or English or... That is not... Always feel that "I am worthless, but I have been, by the grace of my Guru Mahārāja, I have been given the chance. So kindly accept whatever little service I can give. I am offensive. So kindly excuse me." In this way be humble, meek, and offer your feeling, and Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. Not that you have to show how you can speak in Sanskrit language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> In another <span class="Italic">śloka, tṛṇād api sunīcena taror...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">...api sahiṣṇūna amāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) So you, for the time being, engage. See that the Hindi publication is done very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> What I thought was... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>6.1]<span class="Italic">. Anāśritaḥ kar...</span> Everyone is expecting some good result for his sense gratification. That is <span class="Italic">āśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ.</span> He has taken the shelter of good result. But one who does not take shelter of the result of activities... It is my duty. <span class="Italic">Karyam. Karyam</span> means "It is my duty. Doesn't matter what is the result. I must do it sincerely to my best capacity. Then I don't care for the result. Result is in Kṛṣṇa's hand." <span class="Italic">Karyam:</span> "It is my duty. My Guru Mahārāja said it, so it is my duty. It doesn't matter whether it is successful or not successful. That depends on Kṛṣṇa." In this way, anyone, if he works, then he is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Not the dress, but the attitude of working. Yes, that is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa. Karyam:</span> "It is my duty." <span class="Italic">Sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca.</span> He is yogi, first-class yogi. Just like Arjuna. Arjuna officially, he did not take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> He was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> soldier. But when he took it very seriously, <span class="Italic">karyam-</span>"Kṛṣṇa wants this fight. Never mind I have to kill my relatives. I must do it"-that is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> First of all he argued with Kṛṣṇa that "This kind of fighting is not good, family killing...," and so on, so on, so on. He argued. But after hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> when he understood that "It is my duty. Kṛṣṇa wants me to do it." <span class="Italic">Karyam.</span> So in spite of his becoming a householder, a soldier, he's a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He took it<span class="Italic">-karyam. Karyam</span> means "It is my duty." That is real <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> "Kṛṣṇa wants that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be spread. So this is my <span class="Italic">karyam.</span> This is my duty. And the direction is my spiritual master. So I must do it." This is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> This is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa, sannyāsa</span> mentality. But there is formality. That should... That may be accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> That has got some psychological effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. In India especially, people like. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī</span> may preach. Otherwise, the formula of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> is given<span class="Italic">-karyam:</span> "But this is my only duty. That's all. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be pushed. This is my only duty." He's <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Because Kṛṣṇa personally comes, He demands... <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityaja mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> And Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa, He says, <span class="Italic">yei kṛṣṇa tattva vettha sei guru haya:</span> "Anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, he's guru." And what is the guru's business? <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa: [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128] "Whomever you meet, you just try to impress upon him about the instruction of Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityaja...</span> So in this way, if we take it up, very seriously-"This is my duty"-then you are a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Sa sannyāsī.</span> Kṛṣṇa certifies, <span class="Italic">sa sannyāsī.</span> People are not taking seriously about Kṛṣṇa's teaching. That is India's misfortune. They're bringing in so many competition of Kṛṣṇa. Is Kṛṣṇa... And "Kṛṣṇa... Rāmakrishna is as good as Kṛṣṇa." This rascaldom has killed. They have done the greatest disservice. Instead of Kṛṣṇa, they have brought one rascal, Ramakrishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> They have big <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> in Bhuvaneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> In Bhuvaneśvara, they have big Ramakrishna <span class="Italic">maṭha.</span> Vivekananda School, library, so much land, everything, very organized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can do that. You have to convince people. There is no question of making competition with them. But you, you can preach your own philosophy anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> With that happening with the people in Orissa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> ...try to convince them: No, that is false and this is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, their Ramakrishna Mission allurement is that <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva</span> and hospital. That is their only allurement. They have no program. Nobody is attracted by their philosophy. And what philosophy they have got? Never mind. We are not concerned with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> When we were in Māyāpur, I had the idea of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiye</span> (Hindi) (Aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> Purī Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purī Mahārāja? Oh? (Bengali) Oh. This Caitanya Mahāprabhu? (Sounds like looking at child's? drawing) Very good. Hang it here. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Get some ropes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, get some rope. Just read. (end)</div>
