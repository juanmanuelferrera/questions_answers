<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Away from the town hustle and bustle and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is their demand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Which one? I showed him... I showed two places. Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> The very large one right next to the road. The road curves like this. It is still part of that property.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> I don't remember now, I made the inquiries just then and I have forgotten. And I told Suba(?) dāsa Bābājī the exact amount that they wanted and so on. I think it was... I don't quite remember, it was sixty thousand or what. For the smaller one it was perhaps forty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> And the bigger one was sixty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Bigger one was perhaps sixty thousand. I don't quite remember now. We didn't talk with the owner, you see, but the people residing there, they gave an idea. We didn't proceed further because Suba(?) dāsa Bābājī said unless Prabhupāda approves it, he would not seek further. So hopefully that price that they demand, they will come to talk and we talk with the owners themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes, but they're eager to sell that property, the owners? Where are the owners? Do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> None of the owners are here, but I'm told one Mr. Lodiya(?)... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...Vṛndāvana-dhāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Situated (indistinct). (laughs) There is something going on always, you know. (laughs) Just now there is a controversy going on. One Kṛṣṇa Caitanya dāsa Bābā has published a book, have you read that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is from Rādhā-kuṇḍa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No, Prabhupāda, (indistinct). He has brought out a book which is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> He says that this Pañca-tattva principle, we should recognize that this we have borrowed from Buddhism. And there is no mention of Pañca-tattva before <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means he defies<i class="calibre3"> Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> He defies <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</i> he defies <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i> like anything, right and left, right and left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He is a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then he is a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> But, you see, the trouble is he is well read, and he has tried to make a very good unchallengeable sort of a case, and I tell you that nobody from Vṛndāvana has yet been able to come out with a cogent reply. We have yet to find out an answer to two important question that he has raised: one, as to whether this principle of Pañca-tattva has been mentioned anywhere in the works of the Gosvāmīs prior to <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta;</i> and two, this (indistinct), whether this has also been mentioned anywhere before. Both these he says have been borrowed by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. They have been introduced under the influence of Buddhism, prevalent so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How he gives quotation from Buddhism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No, he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But he says from Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> He draws comparisons. He traces the historical background, and then the conditions prevalent..., conditions prevalent particularly in Orissa at that time Vyāsarūpa(?) Gosvāmī lived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> One thing is that he says that it is from Buddhism. So where is the authoritative statement in the Buddhism about Pañca-tattva? That he has not mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No. He has said in Buddhism you have the principle of<i class="calibre3"> pañca-śaktis.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Śakti</i> and <i class="calibre3">tattva</i> is not the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Well, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b><i class="calibre3"> Śakti</i> is part of <i class="calibre3">tattva.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> But these Pañca-tattvas...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Śakti</i> also can be taken as <i class="calibre3">tattva.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> As <i class="calibre3">tattva,</i> yes. And these <i class="calibre3">tattvas,</i> Pañca-tattvas, have been described as<i class="calibre3"> śaktis.</i> These Pañca-tattvas also have been described as <i class="calibre3">śakti</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But Caitanya Mahaprabhu as <i class="calibre3">śaktimān,</i> and others...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2): </b>As <i class="calibre3">śakti.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not all <i class="calibre3">śakti;</i> two Pañca-tattva. <i class="calibre3">Īśāvatāra, tat-prakāśa(?) avatāra,</i> they are not <i class="calibre3">śakti.</i> They are all the <i class="calibre3">śaktimān.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And only <i class="calibre3">śakti-tattva,</i> Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa. And other three, they are <i class="calibre3">śaktimān-tattva.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> They are<i class="calibre3"> śaktimān-tattva.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Pañca-tattvātmakaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ bhakta...</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> That<i class="calibre3"> śloka</i> is from Svarūpa Dāmodara, his <i class="calibre3">kavaca, </i>which he says nobody has ever seen. So it was very safe for Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja to quote the authority of this <i class="calibre3">kavaca</i> because it is nonexistent. And that is his only authority for the Pañca-tattva principle. A mention has also been made of this in <i class="calibre3">Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,</i> but he says that is not an authoritative work, that that doesn't really...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means whatever he says, that is authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No, but you see, he argues it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> He argues it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Argue, that's all right. But this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> The trend is that, whatever he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā</i> all the <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i> have accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> But there is a trend now not to accept it. You see, Rādhā-Govindanātha does not accept it. Rādhā-Govindanātha in his big work, he has..., he has not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This Rādhā-Govindanātha, there was some protest against him. He has not accepted Baladeva Vidyābhūṣana also as authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> He has not accepted. This point also he has raised, this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So this difference of opinion may be there, but he is also one of the..., what is called? Differentiate? This gentleman who has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Kṛṣṇa Caitanya dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So differences are there, there will be always. So how one's opinion should be taken as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Yes. No, but you see, this kind of writing does create sort of a... It does give rise to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So Vṛndāvana is the breeding ground for such things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No, it's not Vṛndāvana. That man doesn't live here, he lives in Calcutta. The book was brought here. It was sent by him to some people, and one copy was directed to me also. Five copies were sent here, and I have the honor to be the recipient of one of them. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How big it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> A small thing, small thing, about eighty, ninety pages. So I was just going through it, I have been, and I will call a gentleman at two o'clock today with whom I shall discuss the matter. He belongs to that party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Which party?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> The author.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> The author, author's party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Author's party. They have got a party here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No party here, but this gentleman has given the foreword. He is the author of Ṭhākura Haridāsa, that big volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Rama-(indistinct) dāsa. A foreword in his name has appeared in this book, which he says he never gave. He never gave that foreword, but his name was given. And he has also published this in paper, and the author of that book has not challenged it so far. So his hands seem to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What he is, the author?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Kṛṣṇa Caitanya dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, what he is, is he professor or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> No, he's not a professor. He's just a <i class="calibre3">sadak</i>(?), you see, interested in reading and writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> So if he will put the name on any foreword, then he can also create any theory. If that man did not give the foreword and he has put the name, he will create any theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Yes, of course, that's what he is up to, that's what he is up to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> And if someone doubts that, then they're not strong followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> Yes. That is a great thing against him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> How can you doubt the authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> I think he has got certain preconceptions in his mind and, you see, he just tries to prove them by collecting all sorts of data that will just fit into his point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like Gandhi wanted to prove nonviolence from <i class="calibre3">Gītā.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> From <i class="calibre3">Gītā.</i> No, not like that. I would say like Brindarkara(?) wanted to prove that the..., that Kṛṣṇa story and Kṛṣṇa religion had been borrowed from West, you see, and they are a copy of Christ religion. Mandakara has done that.(end)</div>
