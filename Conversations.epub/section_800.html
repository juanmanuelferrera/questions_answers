<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...for getting a big display inside. And I got him to agree to only seventeen point five percent commission, which is very reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Let them send. [break] ...is compared with a rose flower without flavor. Man with education is compared with the <span class="Italic">koi.</span> (cuckoo bird) <span class="Italic">Kokilānāṁ svaro rūpam.</span> The bird, <span class="Italic">koi</span>, is very black, but his sound, sweet, so sweet, everyone likes. <span class="Italic">Kokilānām svaro-rūpaṁ vidyā-rūpaṁ ku-rūpanam, nārī-rūpaṁ pati-vrataḥ.</span> And woman's beauty is how she is chaste and devoted to the husband. That is beauty, not personal beauty. <span class="Italic">Vidyā-rūpaṁ ku-rūpanam.</span> And education is the beauty for the brain. And the beauty of the <span class="Italic">koi</span> is her sweet voice. <span class="Italic">Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ.</span> And those who are saintly person, they should be simply forgiving. That is their beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Forgiving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pusta Kṛṣṇa:</span> Forgiving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forgiving. <span class="Italic">Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ.</span> Did Christ said that "Father, they did not know..."?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah. "Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Forgive them for they know not..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how much forgiving. This is saintly character. They're killing, and still forgiving. <span class="Italic">Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ.</span> Christ is very ideal character, but these Christians, they not dignified him-degraded. So you can get on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...how to respect food grain. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone should understand, "This food grain is supplied by Kṛṣṇa for our living. How can I disrespect?" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore we say, <span class="Italic">prasāda-sevā,</span> not "<span class="Italic">prasāda</span> eating." <span class="Italic">Prasāda-sevā. Prasāda</span> should be accepted as Kṛṣṇa. And our eating means to serve Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa has given. Eat them. Yes. That's all."</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">kṛṣṇa baḍa dayāmaya, karibāre jihvā jaya<br class="calibre2"/>sva-prasāda-anna dila bhāi<br class="calibre2"/>sei prasāda-annāmṛta khāo, rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāo</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp"></div>
<div class="Purp-para"> And at the same time also chant, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is so kind. We are hungry, we are so greedy, and He has given so nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pusta Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes we have difficulty discriminating where the enjoying spirit stops and where the service spirit begins, especially when we take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you should remember it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Then it is all right. Actually everything is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Without Kṛṣṇa's mercy, you cannot live even for a moment. You should always remember. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bado dayāmaya.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa badā dayāmaya karibāre jihvā jāya, sva-prasāda-anna dila bhāi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So if one cooks according to one's own tastes, and then offers it to the Deity, that is not so good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have to learn this now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, I'm just parrotting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pusta Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is it that everything we do, are we trying to make some mental adjustment, that "We're taking <span class="Italic">prasādam...</span>"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mental adjustment is nonsense. No mental adj... Actual. Mental adjustment is material. You have to follow the orders of superior. There is no question of mental adjustment. [break] You get all your necessities of life from the earth. Now, you get food, you get drinking water, you get shelter, bamboo. These things will... You get cotton. So what is that slogan? <span class="Italic">Kapara...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Roṭi kaparā makān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, everything, yes. <span class="Italic">Roti</span> is there, <span class="Italic">kaparā</span> is there, and <span class="Italic">makān</span> is there. And wherefrom it is coming? <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī.</span> From earth. Why you are after factories? The mother earth is giving you everything. Therefore he's called mother. Seven mothers... One of the mothers is this earth. <span class="Italic">Dhenu dhātrī tathā pṛthvi sapteti mātari smṛtāḥ. Dhenu</span> means cow, and <span class="Italic">dhātrī</span> means nurse. <span class="Italic">Tathā pṛthvi. Pṛthvi</span> means this land. So they are taking care of the land, nationalists, and killing the other mother, <span class="Italic">dhenu.</span> A rascal civilization. If you are taking care of mother, you must take care of all mothers. No, they are mad after the land, but killing the other mother, <span class="Italic">dhenu.</span> This is called rascaldom. [break] ...to give all comforts to the human brother, and they are sending the animal brother to slaughterhouse. What is this Communist? If you are Communist, if you are equal to all your brothers, why you should discriminate? And our communism is that even there is a snake in your home, you must see that he is not starving. This is spiritual communism. Nobody likes snake. Everyone kills. But <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "Even a snake is there at your home, you must see that he's not starving." This is communism, perfect. What are these he is collecting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Eggplant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eggplant? [break] Not of the sun but of the mist, one who is driving away, "Get out!" Now, just see. He is becoming pure. <span class="Italic">Yāhāṇ kṛṣṇa tāhāṇ nāhi māyāra adhikāra.</span> Immediately there is Kṛṣṇa, there is no more <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> (end)</div>
