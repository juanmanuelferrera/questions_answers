<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You cannot say that I have got a different faith. I do not care for the laws of God. If it is a law... Just like, for example, here in the state, if you kill somebody, then you have to pay for it with your life. So if that is the law in your state, why a similar law in broader sense is not there in the courts of God, law..., law of God? You can avoid the arrest by the police and punishment by the state law by tricks, but you cannot avoid by tricks the law of God. That is not possible. If you violate the law of God, then you will be punished. If you violate the law..., just like if you touch fire your hand will be burned, so this law you cannot violate. Either you are Christian or Hindu or Muslim, if you touch fire, the law of God is that it will burn. So it will not care for you whether you are Hindu, Muslim, Christian. So law of God is applicable to everyone. Either you are Hindu or Muslim or Christian or you have got this faith or that faith, doesn't matter. So we have got such a God whose laws are equally respectable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Universal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Universal. We present such God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Moreover, we present a God that is lovable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Lovable, yes. Practical. Anyone who comes in touch with Him, he becomes a lover of..., immediately. How you can say that is not God? You have to prove that He is not God. That you cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> How many qualifications does a spiritual master have in terms of being a spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> One qualification: he is a devotee of God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Also is he designated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Does he have to be designated by the former spiritual master? He has to be devotee...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, yes, oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...surrendered and designated. That is..., identifies disciplic succession: both surrender and designation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And by the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And the result of activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So far designation is concerned, the spiritual master authorizes every one of his disciple. But it is up to the disciple to carry out the order, able to carry out or not. It is not that spiritual master is partial, he designates one and rejects other. He may do that. If the other is not qualified, he can do that. But actually his intention is not like that. He wants that each and every one of his disciple become as powerful as he is or more than that. That is his desire. Just like father wants every son to be as qualified or more qualified than the father. But it is up to the student or to the son to raise himself to that standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes, I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you are incapable of raising yourself to the standard of becoming spiritual master, that is not your spiritual master's fault, that is your fault. He wants, just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,<i class="calibre3"> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā</i> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]<i class="calibre3">,</i> By My order, every one of you become a guru. If one cannot carry out the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then how he can become a guru? The first qualification is that he must be able to carry out the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then he becomes guru. So that carrying out the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu depends on one's personal capacity. <i class="calibre3">Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā.</i> Acceptance of Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Kṛṣṇa, that is there in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra,</i> in the <i class="calibre3">Upaniṣads,</i> in <i class="calibre3">Mahābhārata,</i> in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> How are the references made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> What references are given, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You will find all this in the <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</i> references from <i class="calibre3">Upaniṣads,</i> from <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata.</i> Caitanya Mahāprabhu never said that I am Kṛṣṇa. But the devotees, you know Sanātana Gosvāmī, corroborated. You know that? You have read that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So <i class="calibre3">sādhu śāstra guru vākya. </i>So we have to accept the authority of <i class="calibre3">śāstra, </i>guru,<i class="calibre3"> </i>and<i class="calibre3"> sādhu.</i> So those who are <i class="calibre3">sādhu,</i> they accept Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The guru in the..., they accept. And <i class="calibre3">śāstra,</i> there is acceptance. So, therefore, it is confirmed. Not only He, any <i class="calibre3">avatāra,</i> he must be confirmed by these three sources: <i class="calibre3">sādhu, śāstra,</i> guru. I accept Caitanya Mahāprabhu because my Guru Mahārāja accepted. He accepted Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Kṛṣṇa; his Guru Mahārāja accepted. And the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> is there. When guru says that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa, he quotes <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i> The <i class="calibre3">śāstra,</i> guru, and those who are actually devotees, <i class="calibre3">sādhu,</i> they also accept. This is the evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1) (woman):</b> Prabhupāda, is Lord Caitanya always carrying on <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i> in the spiritual world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. He is the father of the <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i> movement. <i class="calibre3">Saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ. </i>This is the statement in the <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</i> This Lord, incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, is worshiped by <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana yajña, </i>and those who are intelligent, <i class="calibre3">sumedhasaḥ,</i> sharp brain, they worship this Lord by <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana.</i> This is the statement in the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata.</i> And, therefore, we worship Him with<i class="calibre3"> saṅkīrtana.</i> This picture, He is being worshiped by <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti</i> [SB 11.5.32]<i class="calibre3">.</i> And they are all big men Śrī Advaita, Śrī Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa, and others, followers. That is the proof. <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam,</i> He is fair complexioned, but He is always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa-varṇam iti,</i> He is describing the science of Kṛṣṇa. These are the statement, and He is doing exactly the same thing. His accepting <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i> order is also mentioned in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i> So everything we have to accept through three channels: <i class="calibre3">sādhu, śāstra, </i>guru. Saintly person, they you should accept; guru you should accept; and it must be mentioned in the<i class="calibre3"> śāstra.</i> Guru cannot manufacture something. He must quote from the <i class="calibre3">śāstra </i>and then tell to his disciple. So disciple, as soon as he receives a message from guru corroborated by the<i class="calibre3"> śāstra,</i> then he should take it as fact. This is the way. Why there should be any more doubt? What is your argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> There is no argument, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It's just the conditioning of the mind, the trouble of the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is different. That is different. <i class="calibre3">Manodhar</i>a. <i class="calibre3">Manodhar</i>a means those who are conditioned by the mind, their statement is not accepted according to our philosophy. Because he has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> They have to be cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> They have to be cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So a crazy man's statement is not accepted. Child's statement, crazy man's statement, unauthorized person's statement, blind man's statement, we cannot accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> A woman's statement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> A woman's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If a woman is perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Just like Jāhnavā-devī, Lord Nityānanda's wife, she was <i class="calibre3">ācārya.</i> She was <i class="calibre3">ācārya</i>. She was controlling the whole Vaiṣṇava community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Lord Nityānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Wife. Jāhnavā-devī. She was controlling the whole Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Do you have references about that in any of your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I don't think. But there are many <i class="calibre3">ācāryas.</i> Maybe somewhere I might have mentioned. It is not that woman cannot be <i class="calibre3">ācārya.</i> Generally, they do not become. In very special case. But Jāhnavā-devī was accepted as, but she did not declare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Women today..., there is a very popular topic amongst women. They speak of liberation. And their desire to be liberated is sane, but they do not understand. And they object very strongly... I've spoken to some of these so-called liberated women, and they object strongly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because they think we discriminate against women. So I have been taking advantage of opportunities to describe to them that the only means to liberation for men and woman is through Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Kṛṣṇa does not make any discrimination. Kṛṣṇa does not make. Whatever difference is there, it is bodily difference. But as soul, there is equality. So whatever difference we make, that is bodily difference. So when one is above the bodily concept of life, there is no difference. Why woman? Even cats and dogs. Woman is human being. Even cats and dogs, they have got the same spirit soul. So a learned scholar will see from the spiritual platform. Then there is equality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes. This woman liberation movement, they speak like that, but they try to control every man with their body, they try to control their mind. And I told them, when you stop doing that, you're liberated. And they talk, they talk all the time, but they're still playing woman games.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> They want to be men in women's bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> They want to be men in women's bodies. They want to control, they want to be the president of the company, they want to wear pants, and they don't want to have children. This is basically their idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> But they want to control with their bodies, with their physical attraction. They want to use that too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is material. It has no spiritual significance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Prabhupāda, I've heard that every one of us who are in the movement now has had some association with Lord Caitanya (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Is it so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. He's associating with Lord Caitanya just now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Yes, now. But in some other life, this is what is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In other life may not, but he is associating at the present. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> When you first came, Śrīla Prabhupāda, a lot of people probably presented you arguments such as If you call the movement God consciousness you'll be more successful. If you not wear <i class="calibre3">tilaka</i> and do not shave your head and do not wear robes and do not go on <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana,</i> you will be more successful. And people still tell us things like this, that You tell us the philosophy, we like the philosophy, but why do you go on <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana?</i> So what were some of the arguments you presented to these type of people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is the same argument, <i class="calibre3">ardha-kukkuṭī-nyāya </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi-līlā </i>5.176]. You cut the mouth of the chicken because it eats, it is expensive, and keep the back side because it lays down egg. You see? Intelligent man said, I am getting every day one egg. So that side, the back side, is very good. But this side is expensive, eats. Cut it. So he does not know, he is such a foolish, that if I cut the head, then the egg-giving business will also stop. Similarly, if you accept this philosophy, then you must accept this also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes, that is difference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you don't accept this <i class="calibre3">kīrtana,</i> then it will prove that you don't accept the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes. That's the difference between Your Divine Grace and all these other<i class="calibre3"> bhogis</i>. They make it according to the taste of the people. They change. That's why this movement is so solid: no compromise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Why compromise? My Guru Mahārāja never made any compromise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Compromise means you have some material attachment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, compromise means you don't want real business but you want some money by cheating and by bluffing. That's all. That is compromise. If I aim... Just like this Mahesh Yogi is doing: Yes, God has given you senses, why should you not enjoy? You simply enjoy. You simply give me thirty-five dollars, I'll give you a special <i class="calibre3">mantra</i>. And here, Allen Ginsberg told me, Swamiji, you are very conservative. I said that I am the most lenient. I'm not conservative. You are conservative. You cannot give up your bad habits. I am very liberal and accepting everyone. But you are... Because you are conservative, you cannot give up your bad habits; therefore you deny to come to my camp. I am very liberal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> A Vaiṣṇava is conservative with Kṛṣṇa and liberal with everybody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is not conservative. Conservative means unnecessarily catching something. That is conservative. If you try to protect your life, will anyone say You are very conservative. I wanted to kill you, and you want to keep your life? Is that conservatism? Do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And if the murderer thinks that You are very conservative. I wanted to kill you and you did not allow. That is not conservative. That is self-preservation, that is not conservative. Conservative means unnecessarily you catch some rules and regulation without any meaning or without any utility. That is conservative. In Sanskrit it is called <i class="calibre3">niyamāgraha.</i> (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 29, 1972, San Diego</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the Indians who are outside India, they have got a special duty. So far our economic condition is concerned, as I explained yesterday, that one is destined to certain material comforts and discomforts, according to his body-already he has got. So either you stay in India or you stay in America, the bodily comforts or sense gratification, that will be achieved either in India or America. What you are destined to achieve, you will have it because as soon as your body is manufactured, your standard of comfort and discomfort is also manufactured. In Bengal there is a proverb that <span class="Italic">yethā deoyā bhange, kapāla yābe saṅge</span>(?): "Wherever you go, your fortune will go with you." Fortune and misfortune, that will also go with you. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said one thing, that "Any Indian, any man who has taken birth on the soil of Bhāratavarṣa, India, he has got a special duty. And that duty is to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness."</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">To do good to others, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> So those Indians who are here, it is all right you are earning for some economic development, but at the same time, you try to make your life perfect by Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spread it to the foreigners as far as possible. That's your duty, not that, that you are getting decent salary than India, and enjoy life and forget your culture. That is suicidal. You have got a culture... So this culture is Vedic culture and Vedic culture means Kṛṣṇa conscious. As it is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Vedic culture means to understand Kṛṣṇa. One who has not understood Kṛṣṇa, he has no Vedic culture. But every Indian is supposed to have Vedic culture. And to have Vedic culture means to understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore all Indians, they should cultivate this Kṛṣṇa consciousness personally, make their life successful, and distribute it to the, our neighbors. Of course, I do not think... If you invite your neighbors, they do not come, you said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Obviously, they have got some other work, this, that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. But anyway, because you are living in this country, you must have some friends. Whenever you talk with your friends, you talk about Kṛṣṇa. Don't waste your time in other ways. That will be beneficial for you and for your friends. And before talking about Kṛṣṇa, you should know about Kṛṣṇa. And you can know about Kṛṣṇa very easily by understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> thoroughly. Try to understand it and you can distribute it. That is a great service to Kṛṣṇa, to your personal self, and to the person you are speaking about Kṛṣṇa. And four principles of impious life, as it is accepted by our Vedic followers, namely, no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication. That will give you strength and over and above that, if you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra...</span> You can chant. It is not difficult. There is no loss. You can chant. That will give you spiritual strength. And in this way try to become spiritually powerful and serve Kṛṣṇa. It doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't matter. Everywhere is Kṛṣṇa's kingdom. <span class="Italic">Sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is the proprietor everywhere. So if you be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so wherever you may be, you'll be with Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as you remain with Kṛṣṇa, you are not living within this material world. You are living in the spiritual world. So, especially I request Indians, as it is ordered by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that <span class="Italic">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra:</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41] "Anyone who has taken birth on the holy land of Bhāratavarṣa, India," <span class="Italic">janma sārthaka kari,</span> "just make your life successful by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and preach it." This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order. So if you take it you'll be happy, your neighbors will be happy, the world will be happy. And <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-kathā</span> means to present Kṛṣṇa as He is. Don't misinterpret by us..., just like some rascals do. Even a great scholar known all over the world practically in scholarly circle, he has practically vilified Kṛṣṇa by his so-called scholarship. Now he's suffering. He has lost himself, we have practically seen. So that is a great offense, to vilify saintly persons or God. That's great offense. So read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, present it as it is. Then your life is successful. Now, if you have got any question we can discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Swamiji, the four principles you were telling about, are they for purposes of just other-worldliness or is it for material gains in this world or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We belong to the other world actually. We spirit soul, we belong to the spiritual world. Just like fish belongs to the water. Fish does not belong to the land. So if the fish is brought from the water to the land, it cannot be comfortable at any stage. It will die. Similarly you are Brahman, part and parcel of Brahman, particle of Brahman. So unless you return to Brahman, you cannot be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But if we look at the world as it is today we'll find that people who are the most powerful in this world are those who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is powerful? First of all let us see who is powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Like United States, like Soviet Union. There is no other power in this world who can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by powerful? Then President Nixon is not afraid of anything, do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He personally may not, may be afraid of something, but as a country, yes, it's very powerful. The whole world is afraid of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, President Nixon means this country. Why he went to China? Why he went to Russia? He's also afraid. If there is war there will be great calamity. So everyone is afraid. Everyone is under the control of the laws of nature. Everyone is hungry. So actually nobody's powerful in this material world. Even if he's powerful, it is for temporary. So many Hitlers, so many Napoleons, so many Churchills and others came and gone. There was powerful British Empire, powerful Roman Empire. So nobody's powerful. That's a wrong idea. In due course of time everything will be kicked out and finished. That is the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but what I'm trying to get at is that it seems to me that if you carefully look at the world history during the past...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> World history is that history repeats itself. Everything comes into existence and then vanquished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, that's not what I mean. What I meant is that during the past two thousand years, whoever was very powerful was who was doing all these four things which we are, which you are suggesting that we should give up, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I say that my challenge is nobody's powerful. That is my challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You mean, but that is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's a fact, I mean, when they are powerful they rule the whole earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is your Hitler? Where is your Mussolini? Where is Napoleon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, Hitler is gone, but then we have that U.S., you see. If tomorrow U.S. goes, maybe there will be Soviet Union.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means everyone will come into power for some days; then it will be finished. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yeah, but all the people who are getting into the power are people who are having these four vices, you know, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore their power is finished. If you become sinful, then your power will not exist. Just like Rāvaṇa became powerful. He was so powerful that he dared to take away Sītā. But he also became vanquished. That is the history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes but people say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People say, that is other... You see the fact. Nobody is powerful; nobody can exist here. For the temporary, say for some years, you may be so-called powerful but it is not powerful. We are concerned with eternal life. We are not interested in the so-called power for a few days. That is not our aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but if we say that everything is destined, like the moment your body is manufactured and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...everything is destined, then we are probably as well destined to be Kṛṣṇa conscious or to be non-Kṛṣṇa conscious, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That destiny can change. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says... Destined means so far you're... Suppose you are to get, say, one thousand dollars per month. That you'll get. You try for it or don't try for it, you'll get. Therefore we should not waste our time for getting one thousand dollars. We should utilize the time for developing our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is our philosophy.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Just like nobody tries for becoming unhappy, but unhappiness comes. Nobody tries, that "Let me become unhappy." But people become unhappy. Why? He does not try for it. Similarly, that happiness also, even if you don't try for it, it will come. So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "You don't bother yourself for worldly happiness or unhappiness. Whatever you are destined, you'll get it. You try for develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which in other life, in the animal life, you could not do." In the animal... [break] ...advised... If the animal is advised that, "You become Kṛṣṇa conscious," he cannot do it. He has no power. But a man can do it. Therefore the man's main business should be how to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not for so-called economic development. Economic development will come automatically, what you are destined to have. This is our philosophy. We don't try for any economic development. All our members, we have no concern what we shall eat tomorrow, although we haven't got any source of income. We are pushing this movement all over the world. We have got about one hundred branches and similar devotees are there, each branch, not less than twenty-five. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Twenty in San Diego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty. And about two hundred somewhere. And in America you know the expenditure. We are living in the best part of the city. But we have no source of income. We take some books, some incense, but there is no guarantee that it will be sold. So it is not a book of technology, general demand-Kṛṣṇa book. So if somebody's kindly interested in Kṛṣṇa, he'll purchase. So we are living in this way, depending on Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa's supplying all necessities. We have got seventy thousand dollar expenditure per month. So this is practical. We don't try for getting any job or any business. Depend on Kṛṣṇa. But our main business is to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness and follow the rules and regulations, chant sixteen rounds, Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> So we are... There is no problem for us. To collect seventy thousand dollars and spend every month, do you think is very easy job? A big government is concerned, or a big company, to collect seventy thousand dollars and distribute it again. It is a big problem. So how... We are increasing our centers. Practically every month, two, one, two. And we have got huge expenditure. But Kṛṣṇa is supplying. So we should see the example, be confident, depend on Kṛṣṇa and then everything is all right. Kṛṣṇa is powerful. He's omnipresent. He knows better than me. Our business is to satisfy Him. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are preaching this, that "You take to Kṛṣṇa. Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." Kṛṣṇa said. The same thing we are saying. We are not manufacturing it. Why should we manufacture? The words are already there. We haven't got to manufacture anything. We simply... Just like I have come to your place. What am I speaking? I am speaking that "You become Kṛṣṇa conscious." We don't talk of any economic problem, political problem. We don't talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How can you separate out economics, politics...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no separation. Kṛṣṇa is the all-inclusive. Economic problem means eating, sleeping, mating or getting some money. So we are getting money. I have already given you account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but... No. As far as ISKCON is concerned, maybe that is true. But supposing if you take an individual devotee, see, who is married and has a family and all that... He cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many married families. So many married families. He is married family, he is married family, he is married family. They have got children, wife, everything. There is no problem. The children are getting nice education, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, dancing, eating nicely. Just now we are purchasing one house in front of our temple, seventy thousand dollars for providing <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span> Husband, wife, children will live there. So we have no problem. The <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> are there, the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> are there, <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> are there-everyone is there. We maintain the Vedic culture, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,</span> or <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> The eight orders of social structure we maintain. But they're all engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. That is the distinction. Everyone is twenty-four hours engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What are the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> of this order supposed to doing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are taking to politics. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Whom are they fighting? Whom are they going to fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, some of our members, they are standing for election in the government. Election. And we hope one day some of our men will become President. That is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's</span> business, to take part in administration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No fighter? No fighting? They are not going to fight? They're not going to become warriors, not like the real <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, when you take part in politics you have to fight. (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I don't mean that. I mean <span class="Italic">muṣṭi</span> fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if required, <span class="Italic">muṣṭi</span> fight will be there. Arjuna, Arjuna was fighting. He was Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. But what I'm basically asking is what are these <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> going to fight with?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriya</span> fought... Why don't you take the case of Arjuna? He was a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> He fought for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but in those days, you see, there is some kind of a clear cut...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those days or in these days, the same principles are there. <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas</span> should fight for Kṛṣṇa. That is his perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Okay. Then the question is whom shall we fight now? Okay, supposing we are all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Fight in a real..., sword, fight with swords?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The demons. Demons. Demons. Just like Lord Rāmacandra fought with the demons, so similarly, Kṛṣṇa conscious person will fight with the demons. That is already there. Demons and demigod always fight. <span class="Italic">Devāsura-yuddha,</span> you know? That is history. We don't say that fighting should be stopped. We don't say that. We don't say that becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, nonviolence. That is bogus. In Delhi when there was not..., declaration of war between Pakistan and India, press representative came: "Swamiji, what is your opinion about this fight?" I said, "You must fight." And it was published in the paper. It gave some agitation. They were glad. I said, "You must fight." And that was published in big letters in... So we are not that kind of <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> and Vaiṣṇava, that we don't take care of practical things. When there is need of fight, we shall fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes but if that is the case, you see, then the Muslim Mullah, or whatever you may call, says, "Fight all non-Muslims."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Muslim... It is not the question of Muslims and Hindus. When there is right cause for fighting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But what I mean is a Muslim Mullah can say all non...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, why you are making...? We are talking of philosophy. That is applicable to the Muslim or to the Hindus or everyone. When there is right cause of fight, one must fight. This is philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes but what is the basis on which you decide whether a cause is right or wrong? There should be a common basis. You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like aggressor. Aggressor. Just like you are living in this room. If somebody enters your room and attacks your wife, you must fight. You immediately kill him. That is the law. This is fight. You cannot see your wife being insulted before you. You must fight. You must kill him. That is the law. Aggressor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Does this apply to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should fight... No, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> will not fight. the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> will fight. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,</span> they are part and parcel of the same unit. Just like hand. Hand is the part of your body. When there is attack, you first of all spread your hand. So this is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's</span> business. When somebody is coming to attack you, you don't put your legs, you put your hands. And the hand is raised by the order of the brain. And the hand and the brain is maintained by the belly. Why don't you study your own body? As in your own body there is brahminical department, there is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> department, <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> department and <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> department... (laughter) But nobody is less important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How do you define a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That is for a man, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is for everything. The brain of the society should be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> By brain what do you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean, that you learn. You come to our school. Then you learn. You cannot learn everything in one minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (laughs) No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you just hear. Don't make yourself laughing stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, what I mean is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> means by birth or by action or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not by birth. By action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> By action only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You don't recognize <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> by birth, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no. Then how they are becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas?</span> They are not by birth <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> Why don't you see yourself? They are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So if there is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth, if he doesn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth. That is not sanctioned by the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Oh, I see. So there is no real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no... That is not sanctioned by the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I see. So according to you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇas</span> means by quality. He must have the brahminical quality, then he's <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So under these principles then, there are no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> in India, really, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. At the... Not only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Not all the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> who are supposed to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We... Our... This philosophy, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, according to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> we don't accept <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth. We accept <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by quality. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Quality and work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What are your qualifications for a <span class="Italic">śūdra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdra</span> is serving others. Get some salary and be satisfied. That's all. He has no more culture. That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He cannot live independently. Anyone who serves others for his livelihood, he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> never serves anyone, a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> never serves anyone, a <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> never serves anyone. A <span class="Italic">śūdra... Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdrasyāpi svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> They want some service: "Give me some money, sir. I am helpless." "All right, you work like this." That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So in other words, all dependent employees, they're all <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the statement of the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:</span> "In the Kali-yuga everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2): :</span>So only those who have independent means, then, would come in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can be counted, yes. Because a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is advised not to accept service at any circumstances. That is the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> He can take the profession of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> but not the <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So whoever cannot stand on his own legs as an independent businessman or landlord or whatever it be, he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These are described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I have not manufactured these things. These are <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that "He's <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>"-the qualification. "He's <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span>"-qualification. "He's <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span>"-qualification. "He's <span class="Italic">śūdra-</span>by qualification." And Nārada Muni says, but we have to judge by the qualification. <span class="Italic">Yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam, yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta tat tenaiva vinirdiśet:</span> [SB 7.11.35] "These are the qualities of different caste. If it is found in other place, you should designate him according to the quality." Just like a man born of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, but if he has got the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> qualities, then he should be <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> And a man born of a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> family, if he has got the qualities of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then he must be designated as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What about intermarriage between all the castes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, intermarriage, that has introduced according to the social system. But so far we are concerned, we are allowing intermarriage from any country, any... If he's Kṛṣṇa conscious, we help him marry. There are so many intermarriages in our society. So try to understand this philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spread it so that there will be oneness-one God, one scripture, one nation, one religion-according to Vedic injunction. Not that we are manufacturing something. That is the Vedic injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What is the speciality of Vedic injunction compared to Hebrew scriptures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic injunction is, the ultimate goal of human life, to go back to home, back to Godhead. That's all. This is not... As... I have already explained that this is not our home, material world. We are spirit soul. Our real home is spiritual world. So in the lives, different species of life, 8,400,000's of species of life, they cannot understand it, that we are spirit soul, our home is in the spiritual world. They cannot understand it. That opportunity is available in this human form of life. Therefore if we don't take advantage of this information and prepare ourself accordingly, then we are losing the opportunity. <span class="Italic">Tad api aphala-janma. Anāśrita govinda-caraṇa-dvayam.(</span>?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But how does this differ from the Hebrew scriptures? Hebrews also say the same thing, you know, that you have fallen down from the heaven and go back...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Hebrew... Hebrew, Indian, there are... The aims is the same-back to home, back to Godhead. The process may be different. The process may be different. Just like everyone wants some money. Without money he cannot exist. The process may be different, how he's earning money. Similarly, every religion, the aim is to go back to home, back to Godhead. Now the process may be different according to country, time, climate, men. That is another thing. But the... The same example. Either you are businessman or in service or working, craftsman, the aim is you require some money. Without money you cannot exist. This is crude example. Similarly, the aim is we are part and parcel of God. We... Unless we go back to home, back to Godhead, there cannot be any peace. That understanding is possible to develop in this human form of life, not in the animal form of life. Therefore every human being should take advantage of this human form of life and develop this idea of going back to home, back to Godhead. Either you do it through Hebrew religion or Christian religion or Hindu religion, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. If your aim is... Just like at the present moment people want money. If he gets money it doesn't matter in which way he gets the money. Money we must have. Similarly, the aim should be fulfilled. Either you fulfill it through the Hebrew or through Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan, it doesn't matter. But if the aim is missed, then you miss everything. That is the definition in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata,</span></div>

That will not help you. <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span> Whether you have come to this consciousness, "What I am? I am not matter; I am spirit. I have to go back to my spiritual."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In other words, this question of there being another world, it could be actually learned. There is no belief in word in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You could actually find out, experience yourself that there is another world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. Just like you have come to America. (laughter) Yes, similarly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So you are saying there is a process by which you can see the other world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Does this take a whole lifetime to learn?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It takes only one minute. (laughter) If you are serious. If you are not serious, it will not be understood, even millions of years. That is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I see. It's so simple, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are serious, then it is a one minute's business. And if you are not serious, it is not fulfilled in millions of years. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What determines, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if one is serious or one is not serious? What makes one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, this seriousness comes after many, many births. It is also not so easy. Rūpa Gosvāmī says, <span class="Italic">tatra laulyam api mūlyam ekalaṁ janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate.</span> He wrote a verse, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate:</span> "The <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti,</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this thing, if you can purchase somewhere, just immediately purchase it." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ krīyatām:</span> "Just purchase." <span class="Italic">Yadi kuto 'pi labhyate.</span> First of all, if you want to purchase, the things must be available. <span class="Italic">Yadi kuto.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">kuto 'pi,</span> "If it is available, immediately purchase." Then next question is, "What is the value? What is the price I have to pay?" Then he said, <span class="Italic">tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyam,</span> "Simply your serious eagerness to have it. That is the price." "Oh, that I can have very easily." "No." <span class="Italic">Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate:</span> "That <span class="Italic">laulyam,</span> that seriousness, is not obtained after thousands of years' pious activities." It is so difficult. <span class="Italic">Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate.</span> People are acting piously, but that kind of seriousness is not available even after executing pious activities for thousands of lives. So that seriousness is also very difficult, to become very serious that "In this life I shall finish my business and go home, back to home, back to Godhead." <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "After many, many births, when actually one becomes in knowledge, he surrenders unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Are we all part of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are part. Yes, we are part of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If we are all part of Kṛṣṇa, then what does it matter whether we really worry about becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious or not? We already are part of Kṛṣṇa, so whether we are conscious or not, we are there, you know, and it really doesn't need any effort at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are part of human society. Then why you are trying to improve your position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are trying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> To be more powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. You do not know. You have forgotten the power, part of Kṛṣṇa. What is the function of part of Kṛṣṇa. You are thinking you are part of this material world. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but that is what Kṛṣṇa gave me, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa... You have taken it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The moment my body is manufactured...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, that is provided He gives me that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not "provided." There is no "provided." Kṛṣṇa says this. This is Kṛṣṇa's order, that "You give up all nonsense. Simply surrender unto Me." That is your business. But you are thinking, "No, I am part of this world. I must work in this world. I must have this. I must have that." That is your thinking. Kṛṣṇa's order is, "Simply surrender unto Me." That's all. But you are thinking, "How can I surrender?" And that is your business. If you do not surrender, then you go. See to your own business. So whatever you are creating, you are creating by yourself. "Man is the architect of his own fortune." So you are creating your fortune and misfortune, both. Kṛṣṇa is giving you facilities. "All right, you want this? All right, take this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How does this tie in with the other thing, saying that if you are destined to get something, you will get it. But now you are saying, "If you want it you'll get it." These two seem to be contradictory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa... Not contradiction. You have created your destiny. You have got a certain type of body. So you must enjoy and suffer. And again, if you want something, you'll be offered another body. What is the difficulty to understand? Now you wanted something; you have got a particular type of body. You finish it. Now you want something more, you'll be... "Give me another type of body." Similarly, if you want Kṛṣṇa, you'll be given a type of body where you can go to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I see. So you are saying that if you ask for something now, you may not immediately get it. You may get it in another birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural. That is natural. Just like these children. If he says, "Give me one boy." Is it possible? He has to wait. (laughter) Suppose a girl is married. If the girl says, "Give me immediately boy," is it possible? When she's married there will be. Wait.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Maybe somebody like Kuntī can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, everyone is not Kuntī. So let us go. (end)</div>
