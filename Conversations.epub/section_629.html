<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to sit in chair, you can sit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Here, I'll get you a chair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda can sit here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> Thank you very much. This is fine. This is fine. I have here a check for the life membership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> I'll cash it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Mr. Manischewitz is becoming life member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ohh. Thank you very much. So give him books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> This is fine, thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you can... I saw you before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> Twice before. Once in Chicago and once in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How are you now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> I'm fine, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She's your daughter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> My daughter. My son-in-law. My sleeping grandson. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make him active like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> I have a question. May I ask? Is it sometimes possible that a person is reborn in the same body (indistinct, Prabhupāda coughs).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same body? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Is a person reborn in the same body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you are reborn every moment. You were like this child sometime. Is this body the same? You think your body is the same when you were a child like that, lying down on the lap of you mother? Is the same body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> No, my body is different from a child's body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So different body means you are changing body every moment, imperceptibly. That is the medical science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> Can it sometimes be perceptibly? Can a person...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perceptibly we can understand that the body is being changed so long you are within this body. Because if the person, the soul, is not in the body, the body does not change. Body changes so long the soul is there. And as soon as the soul goes out of the body, there is no more change. Is it not perceptible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> If the soul goes out of the body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no more change. It remains the same. Same status. Why? That means so long the soul is there, changes take place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> I see. Thank you very much. I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, every intelligent man will understand this very simple thing, that so long as the body..., the soul is within the body, the body is changing. And as soon as this body... Just like you are old man, I am old man, the body is no more possible to be changed; somehow or other then I'll have to accept another body. That is called transmigration. The modern so-called scientists, philosophers, they do not understand this plain truth, and they are passing on as big scientists, big philosopher, misleading public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This is for my wife. She's getting second initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give him some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz:</span> Thank you, yes, I have. (gives Śrīla Prabhupāda gift of a fruit basket)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. So many fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pratyatoṣa:</span> Yes, it's all fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good father, good daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bernard Manischewitz, Pratyatoṣa and Urmila:</span> Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pratyatoṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, can I ask you a question? My son likes pictures of Kṛṣṇa. Is it all right to give him pictures to play with, or is that too offensive? They could be covered with plastic or something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not offensive, but it should not be disrespectful. That, he cannot do that. He has no sense now. So better just show him and keep it. Not have it. (devotees pay obeisances) (end)</div>
