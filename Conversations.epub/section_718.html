<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is all because of the body consciousness of a man thinking himself the body and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Somebody has constructed big, big, big building but he does not think that how long he will be able to enjoy it. After this body he has to change.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone is dying every moment, but the living man is thinking, "I'll not die."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That he is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I'll not die."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>The body will not die. He does not die, no doubt. That is a fact. But he thinks that the body does not die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the question of body. That is a fact. But he is attached with this body. So the body will not exist. That he cannot see. He has got spiritual business. That he is neglecting. Everyone at the present moment, all over the world, ask, "Are you engaged with your bodily activities or spiritual activities?" "What is the nonsense spirit? We are all body, this body, so long we have got." Even the big Professor Kotovsky, he said, "Swamiji, everything ends after the body. Why do you bother?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think Einstein was also saying the same thing. Einstein, Professor Einstein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know, but I talked with this gentleman privately. He said... He was a big man in Russia. He said, "Swamiji, after the end of the body everything is finished."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They know... These Russians are the only hundred-percent body conscious. The Carvakas. Who are they? They are descendants of Carvakas, these Russians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in India also, all these political leaders, big ministers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. The Communism itself is Carvakism in a different way. Our <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is a communist-dharma, when you see the same eye, everyone in equal. But they don't want that way. They want other way. From body consciousness, not from soul consciousness, they want Communism. <span class="Italic">Sanātana-dharma</span> preaches us Communism from soul consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the understanding of soul? Everyone is puffed up with his body. Nobody considers even that "When I say this finger, 'my finger, my head, my leg...' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And who is that "my"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is that "I"?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> is death. One may not have this "I" conception, but he has to die. That is a fact. [break] What further arrangement is being made? Today a meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At a quarter to twelve.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You explain.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is also paṇḍita. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata </span>Sanskrit little difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasyātmā-buddhiḥ-kunape tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> This body is just like a bag made of three <span class="Italic">dhātus: kaptha, pitta, vāyu.</span> Actually it is so. They are thinking that this body is made of blood, muscle, bone, and urine, and stool. This is the constitution of the body. And these foolish people thinking that the living condition is coming from combination of these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Material things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only material. Such abominable things as stool, urine, blood, bone, muscle-all rejected things. And they are so foolish that they are accepting that combination of the stool, urine, blood and bones can create a body..., a life. Body is already there. So if you are so big scientist why don't you take this material and create a life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what the Russians say.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That the consciousness comes after the combination of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are talking of this verse, that if this is the composition of the body, these things are available anywhere. Why don't you create life? Therefore he is no better than the dogs. He has no intelligence that "How this combination of blood, urine, stool, and bone, and muscle can create life?" They are thinking that a combination of matter can bring life force. That is the so-called scientists' theory. So these things are available in large quantity, so why don't you create life? Therefore <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ.</span> Their intelligence is not better than the cows and the asses from the very beginning. If they are not cows and asses, how they can think of that combination of these material things can bring in life? When a man dies, find out if there is scarcity of stool or scarcity of urine or scarcity of blood. Bring it and inject it. These rascals, they cannot do it, and still they are calculating urine examination, blood examination and this examination. (laughter) No, I am not saying. It is<span class="Italic"> śāstra.</span> (laughter) Take this dead man's body, and whatever urine and stool is there, examine, and then inject, and come him, let him back, come to life. Then I will understand that your examination of the stool, urine is perfect. This is common question. So long the soul was there, you are very expert to examine stool, urine and this and that. But when the soul is gone... Now the stool is there; urine is there. Why don't you examine and give life? This is our challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say that the life, the consciousness... According to our religion, consciousness, the whole thing is conscious</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Consciousness means soul, soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Consciousness is the higher <span class="Italic">śakti</span> of God, I mean, <span class="Italic">apara</span> to <span class="Italic">anya</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, consciousness... So long the soul is there, the consciousness is there. The consciousness is not there means the soul is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (2):</span> But one thing the doctor has got in power, you see. That is this, that suppose he gives a poisonous injection, that is immediately affected, and why the soul is out of it if...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, all injection will be effective so long the soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. Give it to the dead bodies, he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my point, that if... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. If this analysis of the blood, urine and other things can help us, so you can analyze the dead bodies-stool, urine, blood, something is there-and give some injection and let him come to life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He says that you cannot bring life, but you can bring death immediately. Why is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Death? He's already dead. What you can bring? Rascal, don't you see that he is already dead? If you have to bring something you have to bring life. Death is already there. (dog barking, woman yelling) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> has analyzed, <span class="Italic">yasyātmā-buddhi kunape tri-dhātuke.</span> And this is the beginning of mistake, taking this body as everything and then bodily issues, bodily... <span class="Italic">Sva-dhiḥ kalātrādiṣu.</span> And because I have got relation with some woman... There are thousands and millions of women, but because I have got bodily relation with some woman, I am so much attracted. That is due to the body. Actually I am not attracted to the woman. There are many millions of women, but that particular woman, wife, because I have got bodily relation with her, I think, "Oh, she is mine." <span class="Italic">Sva-dhiḥ kalātrādiṣu. Kalātrādiṣu,</span> beginning from <span class="Italic">kalātra,</span> then go on-children, grandchildren, father-in-law, mother-in-law, this one, this one.

The same Ganges in Calcutta, and the same Ganges in Hardwar, but he will go to Hardwar to take bath so that he may think that "I have come to some holy place." The holy place is Ganges, but Calcutta is not holy place and Hardwar is holy. Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhauma idya-dhiḥ. Yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile.</span> Actually Hardwar or Vṛndāvana, such places are meant to see great saintly persons, to take some knowledge from them. To take some knowledge from them, that is the purport of going to the holy place. But without consulting them, without seeing them, he simply dips into the water and he takes, "My pilgrimage is finished." <span class="Italic">Yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicit janeṣv abhijñeṣv.</span> There are many saintly persons, very experienced. They will not go there. So <span class="Italic">eva go-kharaḥ.</span> These are asses. This conception of life is <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ,</span> animal. <span class="Italic">Go</span> means the cows and asses. This is the explanation of the verse. All religionists think. They go to Mecca, they go to Jerusalem-to the water. They are not eager, searching out that "Where there is some saintly person in this holy place?" No. They have no search out. They do not want to consult. <span class="Italic">Yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> And this is further explained by Prahlāda Mahārāja... What is that? <span class="Italic">Tato vimukha-cetasaḥ:</span> "All these things happen when one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious." <span class="Italic">Tato vimukha cetasaḥ. Vimukha.</span> "Eh! What is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" <span class="Italic">Tato vimukha... Śoce tato vimukha-cetasaḥ māyā sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhan [SB </span>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Brahmānanda was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (simultaneously) ...was complaining about his analysis of stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Brahmānanda Mahārāja says he's like a big ball. Everything just bounces from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is the general way. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> ...what they're doing is that you're not this body, so whatever you do, you just become self-conscious and everything is all right. There were some so-called <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> they admit, and they say "I am not this body. I am not attached."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is that self-conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He said, "Whatever my body does, I am not attached to it. I am not this body; I am spirit soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am not responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. Therefore they say, "I am not this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why different bodies? If you are not responsible, then why do you get different bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> "That is because I did not know in the past that I was, I am a spirit soul. But now I know that I am spirit soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you did not know in the past. So you were a fool in the past. You are fool now also. Where is your advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> "Now I know that I am a soul. I am not this..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply by knowing soul is not good. Why you have got this body? Why everyone wants a king's body or a very nice body? Why he gets a dog's body? What is the reason? Everyone wants: "I may have a very good body so that I can enjoy." But why he is baffled? He gets a cat's body, dog's body, insect body, tree's body. He has also body, but he is standing there for hundreds of years. He cannot move an inch. So why you have got this facility of this body that you can move, you can cut, but he cannot protest? He is also body. And what is he? Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> "It is because of my past <span class="Italic">karma.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you must first of all rectify your <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Then talk. Past <span class="Italic">karma,</span> you have got this body. Therefore you must rectify your <span class="Italic">karma. Karmano 'pi bodhavyam akarmana.</span> You must know what is <span class="Italic">karma,</span> what is <span class="Italic">akarma,</span> what is <span class="Italic">vikarma.</span> That is knowledge. If you remain blind about your <span class="Italic">karma</span> and by nature's way you get different body, then what is your knowledge? Just like if you go to a doctor, he says that "Due to this infection, you have got this disease," so you know it so that in future you will be very careful. That is knowledge." I do not know why I have got this disease, and still, I do not know what further it is going on"-that is ignorance. (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. To remain in ignorance, that is the greatest sin. <span class="Italic">Tamasi ma:</span> "Don't remain in darkness." That is Vedic injunction, "Enlighten yourself." <span class="Italic">Jyotir gama:</span> "Go to the light." But where is your light, you do not know. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> say, "Ignorance is bliss."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That's nice. Yes. That is dog's bliss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Then we say that, this verse, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna that "If you know that you are not this body, then even if you kill all these people, then you are not affected by the reaction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But kill by Kṛṣṇa's order, not whimsically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Similarly, they say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you know that you are not this body-"I am soul"-that what is the soul? <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁso jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So just like this finger is itching here-it is by my order-similarly, when you understand that you are soul, then you have to act according to the advice of Kṛṣṇa. And if you act according to the advice of Kṛṣṇa there is no <span class="Italic">papa.</span> That is the meaning. To know that you are soul, then you must know what is the soul. That is... Kṛṣṇa explains, <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁso:</span> "These <span class="Italic">jīva-bhūta,</span> these living entities, they are My part and parcel." So as soon as you realize <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> then you act in that Brahman platform: <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kaṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the platform. To understand simply "I am Brahman" and remain silent, that is not. <span class="Italic">Mad-bhaktim labhate param.</span> If you are actually <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ,</span> then next stage is, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ</span> means to act in devotional service. That is real. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Just like when some people say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, simply their point is that you realize or I realize Brahman. That is not the end. You realize fully. They think to Brahman means to stop all activities. Now you become dull, without any activities. So that is not the end. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says if you are <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ,</span> then come to this point: <span class="Italic">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you will stay. And if you simply stay on <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ</span> stage, then you'll again fall down. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata,</span> that <span class="Italic">ye 'nye 'ravindakṣa vimukta-maninaḥ.</span> They are thinking, "Now I am relieved from the conditional life." But actually he's not. <span class="Italic">Ye 'nye 'ravindakṣa vimukta-maninaḥ.</span> They are thinking like that, "Now I am liberated." He's not liberated. Why? <span class="Italic">Tvayy aṣṭa-bhavat. Aṣṭa-bhavat:</span> "He has no still information of You." If he is actually <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ,</span> then he knows the Supreme Brahman, Parabrahman, and then he engages himself in His service. And when he is engaged in that service there is no question of material, <span class="Italic">tri-gunātmākam. Sa-guṇan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya... [Bg. </span>14.26]. That is real Brahman, when he is above these three <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span> Otherwise, if you think, "Now I have become liberated," maybe by your liberation liberated, but it will not stay. You'll fall down again. Just like this land. You can take it-here is land-but at night it will be water. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarisa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must go to the real land. If you take, "This is land. Now I am safe," no, that is not safe. At night it will be overcome. And that, to go to the real land, means to become a devotee. Then it will stay. If you are suffering from some disease, you see now the temperature is gone down or there is no temperature, that is all right. But if you do not take care, it may relapse. That is the point. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhutaḥ prasannātmā na śocati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ</span> stage. But <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktim.</span> If he does not go up to that point, <span class="Italic">mad-bhaktim labhate param,</span> then you are unstable. You can fall down at any moment. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> If you are in Brahman stage, then you make further progress to understand Paramātmā. Then you must make further progress to understand the Supreme Person, God. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti.</span> So unless you come to the stage of understanding Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no safety. Then he may fall down at any moment. Therefore we see so, so many Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> <span class="Italic">yogīs.</span> They fall down. They fall down. Big, big <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> they, after studying so much... The Karpatraji, now he is fall down to politics. Vivekananda, he fell down to hospital. That is fall down. You say, <span class="Italic">brahma satya jagan mithya:</span> "The world is false." Why you come down to false again? That means you did not get any substance in your so-called Brahman knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Vivekananda fell down still further because he said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, further... Not... At least we can see this, that after preaching <span class="Italic">Vedānta,</span> he came in India. He became captivated with hospital, as if there was no hospital. There are many thousands of hospitals, and ordinary men, they are inclined to open hospitals. Why...? You have realized <span class="Italic">brahma-satya.</span> Why you come to hospital? And nobody questions. Your progress would have been completed when you, in... <span class="Italic">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">,</span> if you had been promoted to the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> stage. That you haven't got. You come to the hospital stage. That means falling down. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is also propounded by him only, that "You can do anything as long as you know that you are not this body, you are soul." I heard that one day he went into the Muslim mosque and said, "Today I am a Muslim, so I can eat beef today. Tomorrow I am a Christian, so I can eat this, because I am not this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was done by Rāmakrishna also. And when he wanted permission from the proprietor of the temple, that "Now I shall practice the Muslim way of religion. So I shall eat beef," so the proprietor said, "Kindly go out and practice it outside." (laughter) [break] ...exemplified like this: on the glass it appears like a sun, but it is not sun.
