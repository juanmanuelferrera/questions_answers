<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vairāgya</span> is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, shall I say, <span class="Italic">vairāgyaṁ jñeyam akati kṛṣṇa avasyati.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> So unless he has attained this stage, <span class="Italic">virakti,</span> then where is <span class="Italic">bhakti</span>? <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is so powerful that it brings automatically <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> But if there is no <span class="Italic">vairāgya,</span> where is <span class="Italic">bhakti</span>? Understand it now? Yes. It does not depend that you have to practice <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> separately. But if you are actually <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> then <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> is there. If there is no <span class="Italic">vairāgya,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> It is <span class="Italic">sahajiyā-bhāva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In other words, <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> is a by-product of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse">kecit kevalayā bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena<br class="calibre2"/>nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Vairāgya</span> is to be practiced, but <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is so strong, <span class="Italic">kecit kevalayā bhaktyā,</span> simply by <span class="Italic">bhakti, vāsudeva-parāyaṇa. Vairāgya</span> immediately comes. <span class="Italic">Aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.</span> If actually one is pure <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> then everything material finished. That is real <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> Now I have got some <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and some material desire also. That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is <span class="Italic">markaṭa-vairāgya.</span> That does not mean that I shall stop <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> No, you take <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> to the principle, to the regulative principle, then automatically <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> will come. The <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> is not coming, that means you have not been a pure <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> That is adulteration. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> And because there is not <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">,</span> it is adulterated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-avyabhicāriṇī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Avyabhicāriṇī,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate. Avyabhicāreṇa. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is above three <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span> So if I am still under the modes of material nature, that means I'm not in <span class="Italic">avyabhicāriṇī-bhakti.</span> This is the warning. Therefore Lord Buddha rejected <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because, sir, in the name of <span class="Italic">Veda</span> people were misbehaving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> when Lord Buddha wanted stop animal killing, these rascals came with <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> "<span class="Italic">Vedas</span> there is sacrifice, there is animal killing." So he thought that these rascals will create botheration. By bringing <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> there is... He said, "I don't care for it."</div>
<div class="Verse">veda nā māniyā bauddha haya ta nāstika<br class="calibre2"/>vedāśraya nāstikya-vāda bauddhake adhika</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Similarly, these rascals are giving evidence of Rūpa Gosvāmī's advice, that "Here is Rādhā-kuṇḍa..." But whether you have followed other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ, pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt. Etān vegān yo viṣa...</span> You are manipulated by the <span class="Italic">udara-vegam, upastha-vegam.</span> First there is test: <span class="Italic">etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ</span> [NoI 1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then for him Rādhā-kuṇḍa. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has got three dozen <span class="Italic">sevā-dāsī,</span> and living in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. My Guru Mahārāja wanted to publish <span class="Italic">Govinda-līlāmṛta.</span> He asked permission of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. So first of all Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, "I'll tell you some day." And when he reminded, he said, "Yes you can print one copy. If you are so much anxious to print it, print one copy. You'll read and you will see that you have printed. Not for distribution." So we are printing all these books for understanding properly. Not that "Here is Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Let us go." Jump over like monkey. "Here is <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā.</span> Immediately..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Even in <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā</span> should not be told in public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book must be there, in the book must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But in public...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you should go gradually. You should go gradually. You first of all understand Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-līlā.</span> If you have not understood Kṛṣṇa, then you'll think Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā</span> is just like we mix with young women. And that becomes as polluted. Because they do not understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> Kṛṣṇa understanding so easy? If you do not understand Kṛṣṇa how can you go to the Kṛṣṇa's confidential activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Some of the devotees, they said that it is for liberated souls. So they said, "Well, we are all liberated."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Liberated for going to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In your <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you've given such clear explanations along with the stories of Kṛṣṇa that it's very difficult to misinterpret, because you use such clear explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you read all the books first of all. Then you'll be able to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even theoretical understanding that Kṛṣṇa is transcendental will not help unless one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Kṛṣṇa will lift, <span class="Italic">samaste,</span> Kṛṣṇa lifted the hill. Now how you can become equal with Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about if some devotees, I know they want to come to Vṛndāvana...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every devotee, they must follow the rules and regulations, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And engage in practical service to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya āra nā kariha mane āśā</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span> Has he taken order from Guru Mahārāja that "I am going to jump over Rādhā-kuṇḍa"? Why does he go? Daily singing, <span class="Italic">guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete, āra nā kariha</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span> Why should he desire like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are some devotees who always want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not devotees. Rascals. Don't say "some devotees." Devotees will hear: <span class="Italic">guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya āra nā kariha mane</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They also wear the Rādhā-kuṇḍa <span class="Italic">māṭi, tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no harm, but they should understand what is Rādhā-kuṇḍa and how to deal with Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī showed how to live in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. <span class="Italic">Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ kālāvasānī-kṛtau.</span> He was circumambulating Rādhā-kuṇḍa, falling down, making a mark. That is Rādhā-kuṇḍa <span class="Italic">vāsī. Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.</span> Not only counted holy names, but offering obeisances so many hundred times in... That is Rādhā-kuṇḍa. He, so much <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> he showed. He can take bath in the Rādhā-kuṇḍa. First of all, do this like Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ kālāvasānī-kṛtau nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau cātyanta-dīnau ca yau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In other words, first one should understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then gradually the First Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Then ultimately <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Without that, simply taking <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the entrance. Then <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is graduate and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta...</span> This is the step by step. But if one is sincere everything becomes revealed. He does not commit mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some devotees, especially in Vṛndāvana, who will always try to run to Hardwar, Jagannātha Purī, always <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> of holy places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is good to go to holy places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They go independently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Unauthorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They go more to avoid service than to become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there's no harm if they just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see you can become independent, nobody can check you. Everyone is independent. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">.</span> But one who wants to be regulated, he has to surrender. That is voluntary. Otherwise, everyone is free to do whatever he likes. And those who are surrendered souls, they will wait for the instruction of guru and do accordingly. That is the proper... <span class="Italic">guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya āra nā kariha</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted. Otherwise, everyone can remain independent. All living beings are independent. Even if I say that you do not do it, you are independent, you can do it. Even Kṛṣṇa gives independence to Arjuna. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru.</span> "I have told you everything. Now you do whatever you like." So that depends on the candidate. Everyone is free to do anything, but if he's actually serious then he has to do <span class="Italic">guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete āra nā kariha</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span> This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> What prompts the soul to misuse his independence or improperly use...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he has got little independence. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā,</span> he has got this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Why do some misuse it and some never misuse it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on him. If one is determined that "I shall only act according to the advice of my Guru Mahārāja," then he's perfect. One has to submit like Arjuna said, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Otherwise he'll argue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Even <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha</span> has guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even the liberated soul, <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Liberated soul never says that "I am liberated." As soon as he says "liberated," he's a rascal. A liberated soul will never say that "I am liberated." That is liberated. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is God-<span class="Italic">guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsan</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc.</i> <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 7.71]<span class="Italic">.</span> "My Guru Mahārāja saw Me a fool number one, and he has chastised Me." He's God. This is the example. If one remains always a servant ever-lastingly of guru, then he is liberated. And as soon as he thinks that he is liberated, he's a rascal. That is the teaching of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Guru more mūrkha dekhi'.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu is <span class="Italic">mūrkha</span>? Why He's posing Himself that <span class="Italic">mūrkha</span>? "I am fool number one." That means that is liberation. You must be ready always to be chastised by guru. Then he's liberated. And as soon as he thinks that "I am beyond this chastisement, I am liberated," he's a rascal. Why Caitanya Mahāprabhu says <span class="Italic">guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsan</span>? This is <span class="Italic">sahajiyā-vāda.</span> He is thinking, "Oh I have become liberated. I don't require any direction of my guru. I'm liberated." Then he's rascal. Why this Gauḍīya Maṭha failed? Because they tried to become more than guru. He, before passing away, he gave all direction and never said that "This man should be the next <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span>" But these people, just after his passing away they began to fight, who shall be <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> That is the failure. They never thought, "Why Guru Mahārāja gave us instruction so many things, why he did not say that this man should be <span class="Italic">ācārya</span>?" They wanted to create artificially somebody <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> and everything failed. They did not consider even with common sense that if Guru Mahārāja wanted to appoint somebody as <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> why did he not say? He said so many things, and this point he missed? The real point? And they insist upon it. They declared some unfit person to become <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Then another man came, then another, <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> another <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> So better remain a foolish person perpetually to be directed by Guru Mahārāja. That is perfection. And as soon as he learns the Guru Mahārāja is dead, "Now I am so advanced that I can kill my guru and I become guru." Then he's finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They kept fighting, and when the real <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> emerged they all became wonderstruck. They all became baffled. Now they all know in their hearts. They all know it. I can see. They all know that who is real <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The real <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> emerges by his own preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. (devotees offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
