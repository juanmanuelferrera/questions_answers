<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Thirteen thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That is inconceivable wealth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That is inconceivable wealth. And they were fully decorated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We can never imagine where all those cows were able to be situated.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Full of cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, a few years ago we couldn't conceive of distributing twenty thousand <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads</span> a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We started with five hundred. What was that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Mimeograph. Then I think it went to two thousand then to five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now for December we are printing two million copies. Last year we printed one million copies, so this year we must double. Two million copies in one month.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, 1944, the first copy. I get them from selling. Perhaps they had been, American.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very thick, it was a thick magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In those days I was spending three hundred rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, three hundred rupees, nowadays at least ten times. Three hundred ten times?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Three thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least three thousand. I think even perhaps more, Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How were you getting so much money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My income, poor income, from my business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. (aside:) Prabhupāda took us past Seventy-second Street, showed us this place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He showed us the fruit store where he would buy fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Those early days. My best memories are those early days. Especially the morning classes, when you'd be sitting behind the desk...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...and the sun would just be coming in. Prabhupāda would talk for an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only Hayagrīva, you and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Umāpati.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Mukunda. One, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Sometimes Carl would come, sometimes Jim Green. Not very often, they wouldn't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmānanda later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Rāyarāma would come.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Always very responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja was taking one <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew! Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nothing else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I would offer, he would take one or two, that's all. Later on, one dozen. (laughter) And that boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Trayādhīśa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He would take at least twenty, <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Wow!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Trayādhīśa, can I offer you?" "Yes." I gave four. Again finished, again four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You must have been surprised to see how much they could eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um, I was not surprised. He was young man, very stout and strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Originally, we all ate from Prabhupāda's plate though. There was one plate of <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And Prabhupāda would just give little, little to everybody. And everybody would be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is the great weapon, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I used to keep some <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> anyone would come I would give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> After class also you always distributed some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> After <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was clapping my hand. In meeting, I used to collect not less than six dollars, not more than twenty dollars. And that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Three times a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three times. [break] ...used to come sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda said he sold his books then; they ordered his books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they purchased my books. In Butler also, many churches would purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This month the first volume of the Eighth Canto is going to the printers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventh Canto, last volume you saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That reporter yesterday, he was surprised you had written so many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Any intelligent man would be surprised. It is unbelievable, so many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is there an author who has written so many books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> In so short time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't know how to control their senses. This is inspirational...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda told us yesterday that one Sanskritist was appreciating the Harvard classics very much as being very important in educating people about Indian culture, but Prabhupāda's books are even better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said "insurpassable." "Prabhupāda's books are insurpassable."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That man was the chief of the Benares school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Sanskrit department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very learned scholar in Sanskrit. Titles in Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> [break] ...Ratha-yātrā, "No Parking. Sunday Parade."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You convince the authorities of America that my logic, <span class="Italic">andha-paṅgor nyāya.</span> Who will explain this? <span class="Italic">Andha-paṅgor nyāya,</span> lame and blind logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ah, lame and blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Oh, yes, I told a reporter that just a few days ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> America is blind by money. <span class="Italic">Dhana-madāndha,</span> when one gets too much money he becomes blind. <span class="Italic">Dhana-durmadāndha. Tasmād bhajanti kavayo dhana-durmadāndha.</span> To get too much riches means he becomes fool and blind. He doesn't care. So this blindness of America... And we Indians, we have no money, but we have got culture. Combine together, then things will be very nicely done for the good of the whole world. Simply money is not the end; there must be culture. Take that culture, Vedic culture, and use it by American money, then the whole world will be paradise, Vaikuṇṭha. In India one paper, Sunday, they have published a nice article about us: "Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Catches On."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Catches on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It begins by saying that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has had an amazing cultural impact on India in the last two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stone houses or brick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes. Now they cannot afford to make it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Jaipur still there are so many nice craftsmen, and they charge very little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Jaipur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jaipur, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We should bring some to Māyāpura and live there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> ...and train others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Just like New Vrindaban they have a dozen <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They have an expert teacher, Gopīnātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Also Los Angeles. [break] ...and big, big city like Calcutta, Bombay, there are many, many more pigeons. Why they are so small?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They kill them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They kill them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They poison them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They put poison feed out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, killing experts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This civilization is that "If you cause a little disturbance to my sense gratification, I will kill you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is civilization. I saw it practically, that there is no disturbance in our Pennsylvania farm. The cats, the dogs, the cows, the boys, children, they are living like family. In your farm also. Wonderful. The cats are not afraid of the dogs. It is very peaceful. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They are showing paintings from a museum in Spain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...posters advertising Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...pure devotee will also come here and therefore he's (indistinct) bringing for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Caitanya Mahāprabhu goes with His associates, He does not go alone. <span class="Italic">Sa-pārṣadam. Sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam<br class="calibre2"/>yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair<br class="calibre2"/>yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>11.5.32]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">There is <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> everything will improve very gradually. [break] Now the government has not given any opposition. That is very good. In India, our own government is giving little opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Constitution of the United States gives great deal of protection for civil rights, religious freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are so advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But there's a lot of talk now that they aren't, so far as income tax is concerned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> So far as our collecting money, they are going to maybe change some laws. There's a lot of talk about that now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They've done that in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The religious leaders have become such cheaters that the governments are thinking "Why shouldn't they pay taxes? They're just ordinary people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best thing is collect and spend, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Don't bank a lot of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Best buildings are on this Fifth Avenue, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. Stone buildings. They'll last for many hundreds of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, they will tear them down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Beautiful buildings, look at them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> On the lamp post here, green? Right here, on the street side, both sides. Our men went wild last night. We sent out a big party putting up these posters. The thing is nobody will see them today. They're in the temple. (end)</div>
