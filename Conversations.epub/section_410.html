<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Pious people, they see that actually they are not giving any spiritual benefit by converting them into Christianity. So they are very against this. They want some original Vedic school, Gurukula schools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is, we have done already. Satsvarūpa has got practical experience. He can give you advice. He started this Gurukula. Practically this Gurukula I suggested, but he began. Yes. So you can take practical advice from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I don't think we can start building until we finish this temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can start in a cottage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, small way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> And then develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Building is not very important. Work is important. Activity is important. I started my movement not with buildings, but real activity. So building is opulence. You can do without opulence. You can start anything, even underneath a tree. There is no difficulty. [break] They will allow our men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I went. They did not ask any questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no question of asking, but is there any hint from their side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I have not heard that they, Tirumali, they refuse foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's all right. [break] So far reporters, they agree that others have no right to comment on this. (end)</div>
