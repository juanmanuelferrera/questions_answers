<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Organize it and keep hundreds of books. They will live peacefully. But don't entangle in sinful activities. Then it will be all right. Such a nice place. The city residents cannot imagine. What a nonsense life-clubs, slaughterhouse, gambling places, drinking house. This is like hell. Try to save people from this hellish condition of life, without any knowledge, like animals. And nature therefore creates a wholesale slaughterhouse in war, to cut throat all-finished. Many millions and millions are finished. From 1914 to 1950, how many years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Thirty-six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within thirty-six years there were two big wars, slaughter. Especially Europe. Nature will create. Pestilence. Somewhere there is pestilence, somewhere there is war, somewhere there is scarcity of food. But you cannot indulge in sinful activities. Then you'll be killed. Then nature's law will act. You may defy, that's your business, but nature will act in her own way. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot surpass. That is not possible. But they are foolish, they are trying to conquer over nature by their so-called scientific knowledge. They are such a rascal. You change the color of this fruit and flower, conquer over nature. So rascal, they talk rascal, "It will take millions of years." We have to wait million. "Yes, from chemical we shall bring life. Wait million of years." This is going on. And for such thing, big building, laboratory, research, scientific research. Big, big signboard. And the students out of disappointment, going to the roof and falling down, committing suicide. I saw it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Berkeley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Berkeley. Very horrible condition. Let them do whatever they like, you live apart from them. Live peacefully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Be happy. Let these cats and dogs go to hell; what can be done? We are trying to educate them as far as possible, but if they do not take it, that is their business. We are doing our duty, going door to door, "Read these books. If you like, you can come and live with us." What we can do more? We do not make any condition, that if you live with us you have to fulfill. Of course, the condition is that you should not act sinfully. That is the first condition. But we never say that you have to pay so many dollars. Come. Whatever little food we have got, we shall share. So try to understand the importance of this movement. Kṛṣṇa is giving us. This is a first-class place. You can develop it into a Vaikuṇṭha. It is already Vaikuṇṭha, Kṛṣṇa is there. But develop it very nicely, peacefully live. Hundreds of miles away from the hellish cities. For little conveyance we can have bullock carts, when we have to get, transport. Very peaceful life. Introduce it and live peacefully. Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These farming projects therefore I introduced, New Vrindaban, it is successful; Philadelphia, it is going on nicely; New Orleans; here also. In London we haven't got much land, but still we have got sufficient land. (pause) So if we have to go by jet plane on Saturday, then we shall get down Iran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We were just deciding whether.... I think it's easier in Geneva, because the airport is only fifteen minutes from the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In Geneva. The temple and the airport are very close, and there's a direct plane on Friday from Geneva to Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. How many hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> About seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, that is also nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So we're just going to decide after this which is exactly the best thing to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also nice. Which day the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The airplane is on Friday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Friday, that is also. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma, harer nāma</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everyone is happy, the children, the woman. They don't demand anything, that "Give us this, give us that." They have simplified, automatically they have simplified their life. And gradually develop, make little cottages, grow little vegetable, little barley or wheat and milk. That is sufficient. We don't require much. We don't want luxury. We want just to subsist. <span class="Italic">Yavad artha prayojana.</span> We hate the idea of luxury, unnecessary. Do the outsider come to see? Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are impressed with how much we have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will be more and more impressed. What is this city life? In Paris, simply to fulfill the necessities of life, a professional prostitute, so many. And people from all over the world, they come here for indulge in prostitute. From our childhood we know. What a civilization they have made. Spoiling the life. Then, after finish this life, you just become a cat, a dog, or a tree and stand up. And all other planets are vacant. Simply this planet is filled up, overpopulation. Kill them. Why not send there? So vacant land. (laughter) "That we cannot do." Then what is your scientific research? "Yes, we are trying. Wait millions of years." (laughter) These bluffing rascals. Don't be misled. Live peacefully here, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you like, we can set up for the film now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now I have given the ideas, the philosophy, in the books. So it is your business to develop all over the world. You are very intelligent, Europeans and Americans. Give it a shape, for the world prosperity. Give it a practical.... It is practical. There is no difficulty. So much land. Very good fertile land in Africa, Australia, in America. All of them can be utilized for the happiness of the whole world. The <span class="Italic">portal</span>(?) has come or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I haven't seen any new devotees come from London, so probably not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, it was air-freighted, it's sitting in the Paris airport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It is? How do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Portal's</span> in Paris airport, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, it was there at ten o'clock this morning. Did they pick it up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That don't mind labor. You try to grow <span class="Italic">portal</span> here. You have got greenhouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Some bitter melons. Some <span class="Italic">karelā</span> melons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. <span class="Italic">Bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām [Bg. 7.10].</span> The <span class="Italic">pitā</span> is there. Properly put it into the womb of mother earth. That is the process. <span class="Italic">Bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām. Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā. Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi</i> 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> (film projector comes on)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Last year's European tour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This is the City Hall in Geneva, Switzerland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> After you spoke with the mayor in Geneva, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he was worried about the economy of the country, when you explained if we cultivated grains there will be no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "If people become devotees of Kṛṣṇa, then who will work?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What answer did you give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Do you remember the answer Śrīla Prabhupāda gave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda said we work for cultivating grains. All living entities to live together peacefully. (projector goes off)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You have done something very extraordinary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I was explaining our ecstasy. (laughter) Who will feel that ecstasy? That is not possible. They can lecture only. No ecstasy. Here is ecstasy, that is the difference. Ecstasy means immediately on the spiritual platform. (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 31, 1976, New Mayapur (French farm)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Many scholars are appreciating more and more. And on the University of Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, Dr. Radhakrishna, he was a linguist, professor of linguistics, he's a very pious man, and he is writing a book with some other professor in the Religion department on the comparative study of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> in the Indian tradition and the Hebrew tradition. And he's using your books as his only source for the Indian tradition. So he ordered not only one set of all the books, but two sets of all your books. Three sets actually. He ordered one set of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> for his own personal library, then he ordered two sets for the University library, one for the reference section and one for the general section. So he ordered three sets. And when his book comes out, in the back they have a bibliography section, references, he will give reference to all your books. He's writing..., he was writing this book about <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> and he said "What is a good definition of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> for the Indian tradition?" So I showed him <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion, anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> He said that is very good, and he wrote it down and put it in his book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Till now, they took <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> as a matter of sentiment. Religious science they did not know, all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He said he's trying to show that by studying <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> in Indian tradition and also in Hebrew tradition, he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not achieved by studying. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> stage is achieved by practice. That is the special significance of our institution, that we are engaging our men in practicing. Therefore they are getting knowledge-not by reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He was saying there are certain social and economic conditions that need to be present before <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> can come about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> can solve everything, social, economical, cultural, religious, everything. So Dr. Joseph saw all my books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Every one he saw. We showed him some... He was very happy to see the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I offered him the post of editing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Now he's sorry. Now he's simply sitting in debt(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he did not say no. He wanted to do conveniently. Then I thought, it will not be... (coughs). "When he will return, he'll do it." That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He gave me some of his books that he wrote, he gave me some to read. And actually the English in your books is much better than his books, so better he's not editing. It's coming out better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's not a good English scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Actually, he speaks perfect French also. And he got his Ph.D. from the University of Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paris or Dutch as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's been every place. He went to, in Paris he got in the Sorbonne and also in Pondicherry they have one French Institute, and there he got his Ph.D. And also in Holland there is one very important... So by his letters we can, many people will take our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's undoubtedly very great Sanskrit scholar. He had written some book how to make the sacred thread, like that. How many knots should be there, how many... (laughter) <span class="Italic">Smārta brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Now he's written another book to show how his line is changing. His latest book was about the five chapters of the <span class="Italic">Dasama-skanda,</span> which is the <span class="Italic">rasa-līlā.</span> That is his book now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> So he's changing <span class="Italic">smārta,</span> now he's turned different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has no training in <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He said one nice thing. He said that without Jīva Gosvāmī's <span class="Italic">Ṣaṭ-sandarbhas</span> there's no question of understanding <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He made that statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I met him when he was in Delhi once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> We were very inspired in Delhi, that almost every college we went to, they already had your three books, and the librarians, they would remember. We would ask them "When did you get these books?" They'd think, "Well, about ten, twelve years ago, some <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> came. We purchased."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they remembered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> They were (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now they took others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Now... We said that "You've begun; this is only the beginning. You cannot have incomplete set." They said "Yes, we cannot have incomplete," so they took the rest. And also that man, that Sastri, the Ministry of Education? That man Mr. Sastri, in the Ministry of Education, the <span class="Italic">Rātrī</span> of Sanskrit-<span class="Italic">samsad,</span> he bought fifty copies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's also taken fifty standing orders now to complete wherever he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is still there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> No, he has shifted now, he's in Darbhanga.(?) But his successor, he's taken, we just made copy, it is printed in your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> So he made true copy on some paper, and he has two copies of the last order, and this is the balance of his subscription, so he should take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Education Ministry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> They're only giving the Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can take at least fifty copies of each.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> So he's doing that now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They gave me order, I dispatched by post, and if the acknowledgement received, I submitted my bill, they paid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> We're going to find the list of which universities you sent to, because we only found..., not that many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be a waste.(?) (laughter) So many things I did not keep record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Even in Poona, they had, the Deccan College in Poona. They also had, we sent to them also. They also ordered balance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bombay also I supplied to so many colleges. And the Public Library.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> That Royal Asiatic Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āccha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> In Bombay they purchase all the books. We had to do a little negotiation with them, but they purchased everything. Then the Calcutta Asiatic Society, they wrote us a letter, they said that "These books are the best," the letter came like that, "but that we have no funds to purchase, so can you please send us free of charge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no funds? Asiatic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe. Nowadays people are not interested in cultural societies. They are simply for belly. How to earn money, that's all. <span class="Italic">Śūdra</span> mentality. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> mentality is gone. In America also. People are not joining cultural classes of philosophy. Hayagrīva said that he has no job because nobody's taking English as literary study. Nobody's interested. They are taking to technology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Science means how to make the motorcar wheel, that's all. This is their science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> In America, the professors complain to us. When we try to sell them personal books, they should take books themselves, they say that the salary of a college professor in America is the same as the salary of a waiter in some hotel. That is the respect they are given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes they are called churchmouse. Churchmouse. A mouse in the church, what he'll eat? He's in a householder's place, a mouse is there, he can eat something. But church, nobody's eating there. Simply dust, that's all. (laughter) Churchmouse. Any new mail?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Stacks of it. Quite a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Where from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Want to go over it now? Shall we go over everything now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Jyotirmāyī is outside, and Yogeśvara. We can have them come in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just fix on the light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Is now the right time to ask? She has some questions on <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> Is now okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They haven't come as yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yogeśvara has just come back from Italy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the news, Italy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They've finished the preparation for the printing of the French edition of <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book and <span class="Italic">Śrī Upadeśāmṛta</span> and the Italian <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and they should be ready within the next ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> French language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And Italian <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the political position of the Fascists and Communists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Very mixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are called Christian Democrats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can manufacture so many. Fertile brain in the tract of deserted world. This world is desert, and they have got fertile brain. They call? The fertile land in the deserted land, in the desert, is called oasis. So similarly, these rascals, they have got fertile brain in the world of desert, where there is no happiness. But they have got fertile brain, how to manufacture happiness. And <span class="Italic">māyā</span> kicks on their face and baffles everything. This is the illusion. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> They, the world is desert, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">,</span> but they have got fertile brain, how to become happy. And as soon as they make some arrangement, kicks on his face and he falls down. That's all. What do you think? Is it right? Sometimes you have got fertile brain. (laughter) This fertile brain, he will not accept. He'll be kicked out. Everything will be finished. If you want to be happy, then you have to go back home, back to Kṛṣṇa. That is the only way. Otherwise, your fertile brain will... What do you think, Jyotirmāyī? You are intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> I came to ask you some questions for the <span class="Italic">Gurukula,</span> because now if I don't ask them today...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> means, find out that chapter, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī gurukule.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seven, Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vasan dānto guror hitam.</span> The beginning of life is how to become cent percent obedient to guru. That is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> That training should be given. The whole process is that our life will be successful when we strictly follow guru and Kṛṣṇa. Guru means Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa means guru. Not Māyāvāda, but guru means one who follows Kṛṣṇa, he is guru. <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ **.</span> So guru is directly God, <span class="Italic">sākṣād-hari. Sākṣād</span> means directly. So <span class="Italic">sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas **,</span> in every <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said the guru is one, Kṛṣṇa. So, it is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and it is accepted by authorities. Not that it is simply stated. <span class="Italic">Samasta-śāstrair, uktas.</span> You understand little Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Some verses from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? <span class="Italic">Ukta, ukta</span> means "said." And <span class="Italic">sadbhiḥ,</span> "by great personalities." <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas **, tathā,</span> and "accordingly," <span class="Italic">tathā</span> means "accordingly," <span class="Italic">bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ,</span> those who are actually in transcendental platform, they should accept it. So why? <span class="Italic">Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva...</span> It does not mean Māyāvādī, that he has become God. But <span class="Italic">kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya,</span> he is the most confidential servant. He's therefore servant-God. He's God, servant-God. God is master-God. <span class="Italic">Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.</span> So why he has become <span class="Italic">priya</span>? That is, Kṛṣṇa says personally, <span class="Italic">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ:</span> [Bg. 18.69] nobody is dearer than him in the whole world. Why? <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidā...</span> [Bg 18.68]. "Who preaches this gospel of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> among My devotees." So the guru has got two business. He has to make devotees and teach them the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Therefore he's so dear. Not that he has become God, not Māyāvādī philosophy. He's living entity, but because he acts very confidentially on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, therefore he's as good as God. This is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Not the Māyāvādī philosophy that guru has become God. Guru as God, not become. He's servant-God. And Kṛṣṇa is master-God. So the success is that both the Gods, when one is accepted by both the Gods, then his life is success. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore one has to fix his faith staunchly in the bona fide guru. So if one has got bona fide guru, and if he follows that bona fide guru, then his life is success. This is the process. <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair **.</span> So <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> means to teach how to become very, very faithful, cent percent faithful, to the bona fide guru. That is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> So you have to teach like that. By behavior, by life, by action. That is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> This sum and substance of... <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī gurukule vasan dānto guror hitam.</span> Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We don't have the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you have got? Simply your face, that's all. I'll have to see your face. Why this book is not there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's Seven, Three. There was only your copies available at the moment, and we gave it to George Harrison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you could not secure any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The only other copy is in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any other <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata?</span> Just see. Reference book must be always there. This is the principle of <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> Now from this platform, on this understanding you have to organize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> You were saying that there are mainly three principles to learn: how to be obedient, how to know, read your books and be self-controlled. So that's what I explained to the teachers, that they should do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru says there are four principles to be followed, they should be taught in that way. No illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating, no intoxication. Guru says that you chant at least sixteen, that should be taught. Risen early, rise early in the morning, that should be taught. So whatever guru says, you have to teach them perfectly, from childhood; then there will be no deviation when they are grown-up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> We have them chant now down there. When they chant <span class="Italic">japa,</span> they chant very enthusiastically. So the teacher himself chants...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. According to age, according to... But this is the principle. <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> means to learn how to become obedient, self-controlled, and act on behalf of guru. This is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> Not to learn grammar very scholarly, grammarian. No, that is not <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> There are many thousands scholars-who cares for them? Put in the life. That is important. Our movement has drawn the attention of the world on account of life and the knowledge. They are finding the knowledge in the book and they are finding the practical application in the life. That is the important thing. Books there are many, but the books as they are described, they are being followed. That is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Guror hitam.</span> So, a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> should live in the <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> for the following purposes. The first is that he should be trained up how to control the senses. So that, if you teach, any child from the childhood, he'll be trained up. In that case, that female children should be separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> I wanted to know also what should we do once they are sixteen, because you said they should be trained in a <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> until they are sixteen. So once they are sixteen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Once Sarasvatī said that "We have no sex with woman." (laughter) So, innocent, she does not know. That is, if they are kept separate, they remain innocent. And they are taught that all women should be addressed as mother. Whatever self-control. And female children should be taught how to become faithful to the husband, and to learn the arts of cooking, arts of painting-that should be their subject matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Painting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sixty-four arts, Rādhārāṇī did. Then She could control Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> So after they have learned all the academics, reading, writing, all these.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Academic is ordinary, ABCD, that's all. Not very much. But these arts. They should learn how to cook nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> And what should the boys be taught from ten to sixteen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The principle is same, that when they grow up they learn the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> The more they read, the more they learn. Then they become preacher, teacher. The grown-up children, those who are fifteen, sixteen, they can teach five-, six-years-old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Then they can take responsibility themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way. Elderly student... That is the way of Indian teaching, that there is one teacher, and how he's managing hundreds? That means there are groups. One who is elderly student, he's taking some beginners: "Write <span class="Italic">a</span> or A like this." That he can teach. What he has learned, he can teach. Similarly, next group, next group. So in this way, one teacher can manage hundreds of students of different categories. This is organization. Not that everything I have to do. I cannot teach anybody to do it. That is not intelligence. Intelligence is that employ others to help you. That is intelligence. Not that "Oh, I was busy, I could not do it." Why? What about your assistant? Train assistant so that in your absence things can be done. So the elderly students, they could be... Just Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to do that. When He was sixteen years old he could argue with Keśava Kāśmīrī, because He was practiced. In this way, stage after stage, everyone should be expert. Everyone should be teacher and student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The boys, they should learn how also to cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? I never said that. Why you are bringing that question? I said the girls should be. Cooking is not boy's business. But cooking is not a very difficult art. If they want, the boys can... (coughs) There are so many, in the <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta sindhu</span> it is stated, how Rādhārāṇī was qualified. So these things should be taught to the girls. If the girls are taught to give service to the husband to the greatest satisfaction, there will be no disagreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Can the older boys be trained in a particular kind of devotional service? For example, press work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, everything is devotional. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> there are varieties. We are not Māyāvādī, impersonalists, finished, all business. It is not like that. So whatever business is going on in our movement, everything should be taught according to the capacity, boys or girls, it doesn't matter. Some department is suitable for the boys, some department are suitable for the girls. In this way, they should be trained up. But everyone should be trained up to give service. That is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> And <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> this sex impulse should be controlled. That ruins the whole character. Our big, big <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> are becoming victimized. So that is the danger. Woman is good, man is good; when they combine together, bad. This is the material world. Both of them are good, but when they combine together, they are bad. This is material world. In the spiritual world, there is no such combination of sense gratification. Therefore it is always good. Everyone is part and parcel of God. So they are good. In the spiritual world, they combine together, it becomes bad, in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such combination of sense gratification. Therefore they are always good. So you have to train like that. In the spiritual world there are very, very beautiful women, thousand, thousands times. Here, in the heavenly planets, they are calculated the best perfectional body of the woman. But in the spiritual world, still further. But there is no attraction of sex. They are working together, serving together, everything. But the sex attraction, there is no. They are elevated so much in the service of the Lord.... Sex attraction is a kind of pleasure. So there are different types of pleasure. Here, if somebody, good foodstuff is there, and.... That is also another sense pleasure, and by the time one beautiful woman is canvassing, "Now, come and let us enjoy," he will give up this good food. He'll go for sex. Because he will think this is better than that. So one pleasure is rejected if one is engaged in better pleasure. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> So in the spiritual world the service of the Lord is so pleasing, that they can neglect this sex pleasure. That is spiritual world. They have no attachment for sex pleasure. <span class="Italic">Yadāvadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinde nava-nava-rasa-dhāmānudyata bata nārī-saṅgame bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭu.</span> When one spits on the sex pleasure, that means he is elevated in spiritual life. So in the material world that is not possible. But by training, by knowledge, one can be elevated. That is <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> So these are the general principles. Now arrange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> I was thinking about that, that because the girls are trained like <span class="Italic">brahmacārīnis</span> also in the <span class="Italic">Gurukula,</span> they should be also kept very, very simple, just like the little boys, <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our life is simple. We don't want luxury. We don't want luxury, but as we are accustomed in so many ways, as far as possible. But life should be very simple. To increase unnecessary things unnecessarily, that is material life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> I was thinking in that way, simple clothes, no jewels, just like the boys, simple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't say "no." But give a taste for the good, then it will be automatically "no." And if you say "no" then he'll, they will rebel. The four "no's," that is very difficult. Still they are breaking. No illicit sex, they are breaking. But if they develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this will be automatically "no." So don't bring many "no's," but give them positive life. Then it will be automatically "no." And if you say "no," that will be a struggle. This is the psychology. Positive engagement is devotional service. So if they are attracted by devotional service, other things will be automatically "no." <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> day. <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> day, we observe fasting. And there are many patients in the hospital, they are also fasting. But they'll "No, no." They'll, within heart, "If I get, I shall eat, I shall eat." But those who are devotee, they voluntarily "no." The same fasting is going on for the devotees and the hospital patient. And that "no" and this "no," there is difference. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is not meant for the mass of people, but at least if we keep a section of people ideal to the human society, they will be guided. At the present moment, there is no ideal section. Everyone is rascal, demons, rogues, everything. There is no ideal character. All politicians, scientists, leaders, they are all drunkards and woman-hunters. So what they can lead? There is no ideal man in the society. The politicians are giving big, big speech in the United Nations. They'll go to the same hotel where another debauchee is dancing and drinking. That's all. That is his character. Is it not? So what he will do? We can give a very big speech, that's all. What is his character? There is no ideal character in the present human society. Do they appreciate our, these restrictions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Our restrictions? Yes, they are impressed. They sometimes write about the <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> that we are treating roughly the children by making them so austere. But every time they show the picture, the children are always happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have standardized their happiness on these principles-illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling. That is the standard. And if you deny that, they say, "Oh, it is impossible. These are the primary principles of life." Yes. Such a big man like Rolan(?) said, he said, "Oh, it is impossible." He was a big man, philosopher, very nice gentleman; still, he said "Oh, it is impossible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> You were saying that the children should learn these three, geography and these things, and I wanted to know if they should also learn what they call biology, that is how the body is working, what are the bones and blood and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Just to have some general knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply waste of time, simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Even the basic of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the basic? What you will know by that? Biology is going on, whether you study or not study. You are eating, it is transforming into blood, everyone knows. And how he's transforming into blood? What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> You were saying they should learn geography and history, just for general knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is because you have to go from America to India. You must know. (laughter) You have to calculate two plus two equal to four, a little mathematics. But this biology and this "logy," they are useless. There is no necessity. What you'll gain by understanding biology? Even one who knows biology, the medical man, he gives a tablet, "Perhaps it may help you." "Perhaps." He's not sure. So what is the use? First of all, he'll take one ounce of blood from you, and they send, this station, that station, now making a chart, then he'll give you a tablet, "Perhaps it may help." This is going on. Even the biggest pathologist, medical man, cannot guarantee that whatever medicine... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...some group doctors? Some portion of the devotees medical knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no harm, but when medical men are available by paying something, why should you waste your time? There are so many things we purchase, you pay for them. Not that we have to learn everything. So many things we have to do. Does it mean that you have to learn everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's lots of doctors, but there's no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So the principle is, don't waste time. If one has already learned medical science, all right, bring him to some service. But not that our men have to go to the medical college to learn medical science. That is not the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> So because we're in the country, I was taking the children in the land here and teaching them how to recognize the different plants. Is that useful, or should I not do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different plants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Plants, yes, here we have so many different plants growing, some medical plants, some that can be eaten. Is there any use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Different plants, that is botanical study, that has also no utilization. But you can teach them, "Just see, this plant is coming from earth. The earth is the mother of this plant." These things you can convince them. Is it not a fact? The grass is coming, the tree is coming, and the animal eating grass. Then the animal is coming. The man is eating food grains, then man is coming. So originally the earth is the mother, feeding everyone. Is there any denial? What do you think? So earth is the mother of all living entities, convince them. So all living entities are children. Mother earth is the mother. The father? Where is father, find out. Everyone has got idea, father, mother and children. Children are there. The mother is there. Where is the father? If somebody says "I have not seen father; how can I recognize father?" that does not mean... Because the mother is there, because the children are there, there must be father. If you do not know, try to know it from your mother, from your superior. From <span class="Italic">Veda-mātā.</span> You have to know from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So at that young age they can very easily develop faith in Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">That's all. That study will be nice. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ.</span> Just like father gives the seed, similarly, Kṛṣṇa gives the seed. The seed, when pushed into the womb of the mother and properly nourished, a rose plant comes out. This plant comes out. The seed is there. It is very easy. The father injects the seed within the womb of the mother, and the childs come out. Similarly, whatever is coming out from the earth, the seed-giving father is Kṛṣṇa, and when the seed is pushed within the womb of the mother, then the plant is coming, and everything. This nature's law is going on. Where is the necessity of understanding more than this? We understand the mother is pregnant. Now how she has been, how the child is growing, that is not under your control. It is going on. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">,</span> immediately it is in hand of the nature. Even if you study, you cannot understand how things are arranged-the intestine is joined to the navel of the child and the food is supplied, how it is mechanical: do you know everything? Can anyone do? Can anyone understand? But things are there. That is being done by <span class="Italic">prakṛtiḥ.</span> Even if you study, you cannot understand. So best thing is to understand that it is being done by nature under the instruction of Supreme Lord. Let us chant Hare Kṛṣṇa instead of studying these.... There are many students, many botanists, many.... They, vaguely they are studying, and the have no understanding of Kṛṣṇa. They're denying, rather the father. The child has come into existence without father. This is their knowledge. So instead of becoming such a fool and rascal it is better not to study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> I also thought of a way to help the children remember the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book stories easier. It was... You started that long time ago with Madhupuri, you asked her to make the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book into a poem. That was a long time ago in New York, then she didn't do it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book is not difficult to be understood by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> I was thinking if we make into poem and put music and they sing it, then they can remember...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can do, to make it understandable easily. It is already easy. If you want to make more easy, then do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Okay. You also allowed... You said that some parents can keep their children with them and teach themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You follow that, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī gurukula,</span> that I've already explained. That should be done. Don't bring any new thing, imported ideas. That will not be helpful. It will be encumbrance. "My experiment with truth"-Gandhi's movement. Truth is truth. "Experiment" means you do not know what is truth. It is a way of life, everything is stated there, try to train them. Simple thing. We are not going to teach biology or chemistry. They are not going to... Our students are not going to... Our students should be fit for teaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. By their character, by their behavior, by their knowledge, that is wanted. Biology, chemists, physicists, and mathematician there are hundreds and thousands. We are not going to waste our time that <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> should produce a great grammarian, a great geologist, biologist, don't want that. There are many other educational institutions. If you can get a good driver of your car, so what is the use of wasting your time to learn driving? Is it not? If you have got important business, you can do that. Why should you waste your time to learn driving? Better employ one driver, pay him some fare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You once said in Vṛndāvana that the Marwaris, they don't bother going to school because they can make a lot of money by sitting by the phone and just pay a few rupees a day and any educated fool can do the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they do that. They are employing in their factory, big, big chemist, big, big physicist, engineer and so on, but they do not bother. They are paying thirty thousand rupees per month salary, Birla. Expert, imported from foreign country, but their sons are never troubled. They know how to utilize that worker of thirty thousand rupees per month and to earn thirty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> from him. Why shall he waste his time? He knows how to they earn. They pay a man thirty thousand and through him earn thirty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Actually, in order to make a balanced society, the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is very important, cooperation. So these things are meant for the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are not meant for this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You once told me that a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> must know how to do everything perfectly so that he can teach others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be, you may be a teacher, but you'll remain only a worker. That is another thing. Just like Dronācārya, he taught, he remained a teacher. So we can become a teacher of a particular subject matter, but that does not mean you should be worker. Still, there are many professors, they are teacher, they are not worker. But if the teachers are available, why you should become a teacher? Let them teach. We have to save our time for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. After all, this, in the modern world they have invented so many varieties of occupations unnecessarily, to develop economic condition. Is it not? But our philosophy is that you cannot develop your economic condition than you are destined to suffer or enjoy. So one should not waste his time for so-called development of economic condition. He should utilize his time for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which was not possible in any other form of life. When we had cat's and dog's life, tree's life, we could not do that, development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now we have got human form of life, we should fully utilize it for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why should we waste our time for economic development? Economic development is not possible. Then every work, every city, they are trying to develop this economic condition, but they're struggling. Why they word it of "struggle for existence" is there? It is not possible. Why there are varieties of social position? Everyone could come on the same standard. That is not possible. Anywhere you go, the three classes of men, upper class, middle class and lower class, is there. Is there any country where there is not these three classes, only the upper class? Is there any country? Then what is the use? Anywhere you'll go, you'll find this upper class, middle class and lower class. In the beginning, I thought that America, everyone is richer class. So when I came I saw the three classes are already there. The lower class, although the country has good facilities not to become lower class, still, voluntarily they are hippies, lower class. They are lying on the street. Although he has got very good opportunity to become first class, but he is lying on the street. Why? What is answer? British Empire, London, one is lying on the bench. New York, lying on the bench. There is no sufficient clothing? Why? Actually, he can live very comfortably, but why he's living in that condition? What is answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's his nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has to live in that way. That is his destiny. You cannot change it by artificial ways. Even if he has got all the facilities, he will have to live like that. That is nature. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa saṅgo 'sya sad-asad janma yoniṣu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is... So therefore there is no use of so-called improvement. And you cannot do it. This is a fact. <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta kovido.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Na labhyate yad bhramatām upary.</span> Your standard of happiness and distress must be there because you are destined by the laws of nature. You have to suffer although you are born in America. In New York you can get very comfortable life there; still, you have lie down on the bench, lie down. Although you are born of a rich man's family, you have to become hippies, lie down here. Who can check this? What is that law. Do they know it? But there is a law. There will be a first class, second class, third class, fourth class. You cannot check it. Huh? New York City? So cared for? Nasty road, streets. And always, every moment-<span class="Italic">dung dung dung dung dung dung dung dung,</span> <span class="Italic">gu gu gu gu gu gu gu</span>-fire. <span class="Italic">Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka **.</span> Fire is blazing.

<div class="After-Verse"> "Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet (Brahmaloka) down to the lowest planet (Pātāla). As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries, even though we do not desire them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is philosophy. What is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Every man everywhere is trying to obtain the greatest amount of sense enjoyment by various endeavors. Some of them are busy engaged in trade, industry, economic development, political supremacy, etc., and some of them are engaged in fruitive work to become happy in the next life by attaining higher planets. It is said that in the moon the inhabitants are fit for greater sense enjoyment by drinking <span class="Italic">soma-rasa,</span> and the Pitrloka is obtained by good charitable work. So there are various programs for sense enjoyment, either during this life or in the life after death."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such a pleasing planet, and these rascals say there is no life. The moon is described everywhere, the most pleasing planet. Actually, when there is moon in the sky, how it is pleasing. So that planet is meant for the high-class pious persons, and they get their life for ten thousands of years. They live very comfortably, drink <span class="Italic">soma-rasa.</span> These are the descriptions we get from <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And these rascals say it is desert. And we have to believe them. And practically we see how pleasing it is. As soon as the moon planet is there, the whole atmosphere becomes pleasing. And it is desert. And we have to believe these rascal scientists and disregard the description of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> What do you think? Is that very good intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We disregard the statement of Vyāsadeva, and we have to accept the statement of a rascal drunkard. (laughter) We are not so unfortunate. The unfortunate, they can believe that, we cannot believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Now they have published pictures of Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them do that, befool others. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because others, they are blind, this blind man, whatever he says, they believe. They will say "Perhaps ten millions of years ago there was life, perhaps." These things are going on. But we know every planet is full of living entity. There is regular life and there are streets. The streets are paved with pearls, corals, in Svargaloka. We have got information. And what is their information? Scratching some sand and bring it, that's all. As if sand is not available. But we give information there are planets where the pavements are with pearls. Go and bring some pearls. There is the ocean of milk. Bring some milk from there. And then we shall understand that you are making some research. Simply all over the universe dry sand? And here the population is increasing. Just see. We have to believe all this. Everything is by nature vacant and all people and animals are here. And we have to believe that. Hmm. Read it. They are exposing more and more about their nonsensical scientific inquiry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Some are trying to reach the moon or other planets by some mechanical arrangement, for they are very anxious to get into such planets without doing good work. But it is not to happen. By the law of the Supreme, different places are meant for different grades of living beings according to the work they might have performed. By good work only, as prescribed in the scriptures, can one obtain birth in a good family, opulence, good education and good bodily features. We see also that even in this life one obtains a good education or money or bodily beauty. Similarly, in our next birth we get such desirable positions only by good work. Otherwise it would not so happen that two persons born in the same place at the same time are seen differently placed according to the previous work. But all such material positions are not permanent. The positions in the topmost Brahmaloka and in the lowest Pātāla are also changeable according to our own work. The philosophically inclined person must not be tempted by such changeable positions. He should try to get into the permanent life of bliss and knowledge where he will not be forced to come back again to the miserable material world, either in this or that planet. Miseries and mixed happiness are two features of material life, and they are obtained in Brahmaloka and in other <span class="Italic">lokas</span> also. They are obtained in a life of the demigods and also in the life of the dogs and hogs. The miseries and mixed happiness of all living beings are only of different degree in quality, but no one is free from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. Similarly everyone has his destined happiness also. No one can get more or less of these things simply by personal endeavors. Even if they are obtained, they can be lost again. One should not, therefore, waste time with these flimsy things, but one should only endeavor to go back to Godhead. That should be the mission of everyone's life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our position. We should not waste a single moment for so-called material things, happiness. Best save time and utilize it for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That's all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Yes, and just one more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> Because you were saying that the parents can keep their children and teach them themselves, like Arundhatī is teaching Aniruddha. So does it mean that the parents can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He complained that "My boy is not being properly..." So I said that "You teach your son."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmāyī:</span> She can keep him and teach him all the time? Until he's older and so on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes. That is the duty of the father and mother. Along with that, he can teach others also. These things are to be organized. But some way or other, our students should be given education and spiritual life, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Individually, collectively, somehow or other. The principle is laid down there, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī gurukule vasan dānto guror-hitam.</span> That's the beginning. Everything is there, we have to simply follow it. We haven't got to manufacture anything. That is a waste of time. Whatever is there, you follow. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...silk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thailand silk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. He has invited me to go to Thailand to meet the Prime Minister in October.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, if there is an interview, you must go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. Perhaps you would like to tell me on what level I should present our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the level of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> God is the supreme controller. And we have to learn how to remain peacefully under the supreme controller. Just like citizens and the government. Good citizenship means one who lives under the control of the government. Similarly, a good person is one who is God conscious and lives according to the instruction of God. So there is instruction of God, we are presenting this all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And they should give us some facilities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We want to preach. Here also, if you give us facility, we can preach. That is after your interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This one gentleman has already offered one house in Bangkok. He's put at our disposal, in the middle of the city. A very beautiful house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But now I'm wondering how this should be managed, who should take charge of this project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can send some men from India. Bangkok is not far away from India. If we get a living place, then we can find out. When there are rice thrown, the crows will come. If there is no rice, how the crows will come? This is the philosophy. (laughter) If there is living place, then many crows will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So we can first go and see the situation and then contact our men in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Men will be supplied from India. What is his name? Send him some thanks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, Mr. Bulson(?). I'll give it to you. <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a Hong Kong man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No, he is from Thailand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, Bangkok.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And he's a multimillionaire. He owns approximately one third of all the land in Thailand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Chairman of many big businesses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have given some books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He has received books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you will meet him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> His former secretary is now a devotee in this temple, she is from Thailand. And when he came to visit her in Paris, she introduced me to him, and since then he has spoken about us to his family, to businessmen. Many big people in Thailand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> People in Thailand are quite pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are Indian culture. Their original culture is Indian. It is called Siam. (pronounces like <span class="Italic">Śyāma</span>) Kṛṣṇa's name. And they have got the airplane, Garuḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. Garuḍa Airlines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are devotees originally, all Kṛṣṇa devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The king is speaking Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It was known, it has been changed now. Formerly, it was known as Syam state, Siam. Syam is the name of Kṛṣṇa. Whole state was named under Kṛṣṇa. So, and they manufacture very nice idol of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. They're accustomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have a very strong Buddhist influence there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Buddhist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Later on, they became Buddhist, but originally they were Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So they will not make some objection if they think we are thinking we have come to preach Hinduism in a Buddhist country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not... Don't establish Deity. Talk on philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> "God is the supreme controller."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We accept Lord Buddha as incarnation of God. Show in our books that we have got all respect for Buddha. We do not disrespect Lord Buddha, neither go against him. Anyway, if we get one house to live and a supporter, a big supporter, then our position will be secure. And if our cause is honest, then nobody can check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He has said that first I should come and speak to the Prime Minister and then speak at the University, and then see the reaction, and then we can go to see the king and say that this has been the reaction at the universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Do it organizedly. They understand French language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, English and French. They are very close to Vietnam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Take this opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
