<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in Detroit they do not go on the street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, not in the local neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far, there was no disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, not while we were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, they haven't reported any disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the black men, they come also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, I think they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sympathetic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, because the devotees are not prejudiced in any way. We have white devotees and we have black devotees also. And if the neighbors want to come and see the place, then they are allowed in and shown around. We are about the only ones who could possibly live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We are the only ones that could live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (long pause) What is the reason they are given equal facility, still they are so wretched, poor, ruffian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just low class. There's no intelligence how to utilize their wealth correctly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same thing in Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think you gave that example. If you give... If there's a dog and you put him on a king's throne, (Prabhupāda laughs) he'll still come and lick your feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he'll lick up shoes. Another example is given: (Bengali saying) <span class="Italic">aṅgārā śveta...</span> (indistinct). If you take a piece of coal, you can wash it hundreds and thousands of times, it never becomes white. And these are material things, but spiritually you can reform. It doesn't matter. If one comes to the spiritual platform then everything possible. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're always looking for a platform of equality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The black men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, just the people in general, for happiness. Because they understand that if there are so many different groups, then there will always be fighting and dissent. So they are always looking for some compromise how to get the groups to live together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is equal-Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. Materially speaking, they've tried so many ways to integrate the black with the whites here in America, but what has actually happened is, through those efforts, they've created a worse situation. By deliberately forcing black children and white children to go to the same schools... Sometimes they have what's called here bussing. It's a big major issue in politics now. Because they take all the black children and they take them to a white area just so that they can go to the school there. They actually take them further away from their local schools to another school, where it is all white children, so that they'll integrate and mix. So it's very controversial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The parents won't like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. They say, because it's like an artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is artificial. They are lowborn, there is no doubt about it. Otherwise, they are getting the all facilities, still they are wretched, poor, unclean, not educated, not gentle, everything. All bad behavior. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...pilot for 747, paying him a large sum of money. And here is airplane, everything complete with a pilot. Create (indistinct) by your scientific brain. Rascal. You are so proud of your scientific...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In māyāpur, you said that the mosquito's body is so perfect that although with one slap it's finished, still it has a syringe so strong that it immediately upon landing on the skin it can penetrate and extract blood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately, just see. And if you allow one second, he'll fill the whole body up by sucking the...Just see what is that nozzle and how quickly they can... There is no intelligence? The mosquito has better intelligence than any human being about his business. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said <span class="Italic">sukham aindriyakaṁ daityā deha-yogena dehinām.</span> That particular body, he is destined to enjoy a certain amount of sense gratification according to his body. <span class="Italic">Sarvatra labhyate daivād.</span> God's arrangement is nice. He can get it. The mosquito is getting. He wanted to suck blood, so he has been given a teeny body, he can suck blood. Very little quantity. So arrangement is there. He'll satisfy his senses, <span class="Italic">daivād,</span> by arrangement of God. So why you are endeavoring? Even it is there in the mosquito, even it is there in the tiger or any animal or man, it is already arranged. Why you are wasting time in that way? Simply sense gratification. Who will understand this philosophy? The fact is explained. That gentleman, Subramanya is very much appreciative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are sane men, they are appreciating that here is a movement actually for the benefit... It is not sentimental, cheating, bluffing. Economic development. Do economic development, why you forget your real business? <span class="Italic">Tat-prayāso na kartavyo yena āyur...</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Vyayaḥ param,</span> simply wasting the valuable time of our life. If you want to suck blood, just become a mosquito. (laughs) Pray to God: "Give me the body of a mosquito." Quickly, you will get. <span class="Italic">Yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25]. Bhūtejyaḥ yānti bhūtāni.</span> You'll get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Kīrtanānanda is here with the car. (microphone rattling-changes to outside)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Simply expand this idea. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣī-go-rakṣya-vāṇījyam [Bg. </span>18.44]. (end)</div>
