<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...with some Indian wife they were called Eurasian, and Englishman marrying Indian wife they were called Anglo-Indian. There was a big Anglo-Indian community and they were given good facilities by the Britishers for government jobs, railways. In railway, almost cent percent. The driver, the guard, the ticket inspector, all, means, semi-important jobs, they were all given to these Anglo-Indians. Because they were not very much educated. And officers, they were all Britishers. Officers, secretaries. And Indians were clerks. Indians, they were accepted as clerks only. No officers. In military, Indian Sikhs and Gurkha, especially Sikhs, they were very valiant. Still they are valiant. They were given the post of captain. Not general. General all Englishmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I have seen many Sikh soldiers. They're very big. They're very noble looking soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're very, martial race. Practically, the Britishers expanded their empire with these Sikh soldiers and Gurkha soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The Gurkha, they're very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And Nepalese soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nepalese. They are very brave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, they're very renowned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sikhs are very brave. They're martial. And another martial race, Jats. They are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> Oh, they can fight... When Britishers possessed India they organized this military with Sikhs especially, Jats, and Gurkhas. And they expanded their empire, Burma, Ceylon, Africa, all these British Empire possessions. And not only that, they fought two big world wars with these Sikhs soldiers. They conquered over this Mesopotamia, Middle East.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They worked so hard. It's a pity they weren't doing it for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They like military. They want military jobs. Very <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They collected so much, but they lost it because they didn't give it to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, their bad policy that they wanted India for Britishers' benefit. That is not duty of the government. Government should be for the welfare of the people. Then that government will continue. But they exploited the Indian people for the benefit of their own countrymen. That is the failure. That policy was not good. Therefore they finished within two hundred years. They began their ruling 1775, like that. And 1947... Not even two hundred years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And now nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, after losing India, they have no more British Empire. Because they cannot maintain without Indian soldiers. Therefore they voluntarily left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I used to see in my grandmother's house, in her front room she used to keep special...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where? In London?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> That was in Yorkshire, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yorkshire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yorkshire, near his birthplace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are also Yorkshire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Almost. Just near, Lincoln.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And in her front room she had many things that my great-grandfather collected...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> From India, yes. And then his son, my grandfather, he was also a soldier. He was a captain, and he was in India and in Hong Kong, and China, Tinsing. And he collected many things. He was also in the Boer War.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And your father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> He was born in Tinsing. My father's family was there, where he's serving. Then he became later, he was a commander in the Royal Navy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he was engaged in the Navy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practically all your family is military.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes. Now he is retired. He is living in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your father is living? How does he like you have become Vaiṣṇava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> At first he would not even speak to me. Then I used to visit next door and my mother would come to see me. And then after awhile he would talk to me from the other side and I quickly used to go and see. I would sit down. I would not preach to him. I would just be social.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After all, father and son, affection, where it will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Now he likes. He says, "This is better what you are doing than all the other things you were doing." I've not seen him now for three and a half years since I left England. They are a little sick now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the age of your father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Sixty-five I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grandfather died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes. (indistinct) when I used to go in the temple there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grandfather was living at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> No, when I was a little boy I used to see him. We were very close. He used to take me for walks, like this, and then he died. And grandmother lived long time and then she died. But she would not leave the family...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His grandmother is still living. Your grandfather also living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They live long time. Much longer it seems than in Midlands, Midlands and Yorkshire. They would quite often live much longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His grandfather is of my age. I think two-three years older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's the same age as yourself, about 81.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here, all my disciples, they're of my grandsons' age. Their father may be my son's age, father, mother. My grandson is thirty-two years old. Granddaughter, she is also about 25.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> It seems strange. Life seems to go by so quickly. A few years ago it seems to my mind I was a little boy. Now I'm 32 and my father and mother are sixty-five and they will soon leave their body and it is all going rush, rush, rush. It will seem, a few more years time I will look back, "Oh, when I was 32 and walking round."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> At least we're not wasting our lives now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My granddaughter, she came to see me in Māyāpura. So I was remembering just the other day she was child and walking, catching my hand. Now she is mother of two children. (Someone comes by) Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's the carpenter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Very good fellow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Carpenter. So it is nice. When there is rain I can lie down here. When it is raining, to lie down in a cottage like this is very pleasing. At least in this country. Tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk-raining, not very forcibly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> A little shower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shower, yes. Oh, it is very pleasing. So this place is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> You like this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. You have got idea. You have all done nice. Nobody (laughs) got this idea. You have done nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I wanted to make you a beautiful palace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can fix up a little fan, then this labor can be saved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> You would like electric fan or hand pulled. Hand pulled?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, electric. A small table fan. Just like in the railway carriage. Let them fix up. Small ceiling fan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You can get very small ones that fasten on the front of motor cars on the inside for fanning the driver. Just a small unit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I was wanting to, in the future, build you a very beautiful construction here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> You like this. I thought you would also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is made simple. It is very nice. Rather, you can... No, it is all right. There is no space. In India, on the roof, we allow to grow squash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> You would like some growing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I plan to grow <span class="Italic">mālatī</span> up this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You grow, on the thatched roof they grow squash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think they were doing that in Māyāpura. There was one big plant growing on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that the family can get one squash, that is sufficient for family. Vegetable. People used to live formerly without any worries. Everything was so easily available, at least foodstuffs. They had no anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Little effort, just basic, a little work and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They got their own paddy from the field, milk, some vegetables. Those who are fish eaters, they have got small lake, fish. Whole family without any... "Where I shall get money?" "How shall I eat?" These things were absent. Even the poor man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Actually I have seen that even in all these villages in Africa and India, they have no real connection to the city politics. Because if the city breaks down they could move back to... They have their cow, they have field, vegetables...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is war they were not affected. And the soldiers would not bother the public. It is said during Mohammedan period the soldiers of one party will ask the cultivator, "Where the other soldiers gone?" They would say, "I have seen and they have gone this side." The cultivator is going on. The fighting is going on, but the cultivator is not affected. He is free. "You fight between themselves and whoever the victor is, I shall pay taxes. That's all. I have nothing to do with politics." This was... Between two parties of king or political, they may fight. Citizens, they have nothing to do who is the victorious. "You fight and one of you will become victorious. So you take taxes. I am concerned with paying tax. And tax, tax means whatever I have grown, you take one-fourth. You see this I have grown. Now you can take away one-fourth." No income tax, no sale tax, no this tax or that tax. And if some year, by chance, he has not grown anything-no tax. "I have not produced, I could not produce anything." Very simple. Soldiers, they were not paid. They were given land by the king. "You enjoy this land without any price. But when there is fight you have to come out." Fight is not going every day. It may take place after some years. So they are living peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> It was similar in old England in the knights' time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the whole world history. Now they have made encumbrance. Naturally, a class of men, they became soldiers. They were trained up, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Whenever I visited a village in India, people were always very friendly. "Sit down, take some meal." Or if I walk through a field they will pick something from a tree, some tomatoes, or some vegetables and give it to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can grow some tomatoes here. That is a very easy thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I have also some and some different seeds to plant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomato, squash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> You would like to see growing in your garden a little <span class="Italic">sabji?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is very... Cucumber. These things can be grown very easily. And zucchini. Called zucchini?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. It's like a small marrow, zucchini.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I would like to get, I don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is not much place here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Some things we can grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this green banana if we get that will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> These should flower soon, these bananas. They are one year old now. Within the next six months they should give some flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is very pleasing spot. You have done nice. I'm feeling nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Your pleasure is our pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> It is your mercy. It is ecstasy to come in here and do something on the garden for you. Very good. I want to see lotuses growing. Then I will be happy. Nice lotuses. When I can pick a lotus and give to you, then it is nice. Then it is finished. Lilies, lotus, nice bushes, very happy inside. This grass has just been laid and I think after two weeks it will be very first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody should walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> No. I have still this section here to finish of nice turf. And then watering twice a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And due to this fountain it will be very nice, green always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And I will sprinkle it with <span class="Italic">gobar</span> water. <span class="Italic">Gobar</span> mixed with water and sprinkle. That will be good for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any good painter here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Artist? Who is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> One new boy that just came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I want his service. I want to paint that picture which is published in that French Back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. The portrait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not portrait. That I was beating on my... What is called? That <span class="Italic">dundubhi</span> we call it. What do you call this. Bango? Bang?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, gong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not gong. It is one side covered with skin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Like a tambourine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, it's... You mean a drum...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drum. Not two-sides. One side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like a tom-tom drum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that picture is very nice. If somebody paints it will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I wish I could make the <span class="Italic">mālatī</span> grow faster and the <span class="Italic">ratnavani.(?)</span> I wish I could make it grow faster to give perfume. It is not like painting a picture. You can paint the flower and the creeper and the tree very quickly, but when you are growing it and you have the idea and no plant, it takes so many years for it to come to a finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is growing it? That is Kṛṣṇa's hand. His hand is working invisibly. Kṛṣṇa's hand is there. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> "I am giving direction to the nature and she is manufacturing." That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And He paints wonderful flowers with perfume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything, anything. Kṛṣṇa is giving dictation, "Do like this." Intelligence is of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sūyate sa-carācaram<br class="calibre2"/>hetunānena kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>jagad viparivartate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.10]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Lord Caitanya, He had the mango tree grow almost instantly with His direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He can do that because He is Kṛṣṇa. Immediately He can do. That is His inconceivable energy. Now by medical treatment man is made into woman, and woman is made man. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, there was that article in the Blitz the other day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So formerly, by simply desire of very exalted person like Lord Śiva and others, they could turn a man into woman, woman into man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I heard a story, Viśvāmitra once he grew people from trees. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is possible by Kṛṣṇa's inconceivable energy. Everything is possible. That is inconceivable. It is called therefore "inconceivable." You, we cannot conceive how it is done. Our intelligence is very little. We cannot conceive. Therefore we say, "Oh, this is all mythology." Because we cannot conceive of it. Whatever we cannot conceive we take it as mythology. Nothing is mythology. Everything is possible. That is inconceivable. But they cannot understand what is inconceivable. Unless it is conceivable by them, they do not accept. That is their foolishness. We can see at night worms or flies so small Just like if you divide one grain of rice into one hundred divisions one division-such a small fly. They are independently walking, flying. Freedom. Now just imagine how their anatomic physiology is manufactured within that small (indistinct) of life. But he's exactly doing everything just like a big fly. How it is doing? Therefore I said in that, my interview.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. "They can manufacture a jumbo jet but they can't make a mosquito. Neither can they supply the pilot."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the mosquito is with the pilot. They are manufacturing jumbo 747 plane. It requires a pilot separately. But Kṛṣṇa is manufacturing an airplane, mosquito-everything complete, with pilot. This is inconceivable. You can manufacture a big airplane. The pilot is separate. You cannot manufacture the pilot. Kṛṣṇa is manufacturing not only the smallest airplane, but with a pilot. This is inconceivable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Also he makes those, you wrote in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> there are those giant birds that fly in space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there will be hundreds and thousands mosquitos, they will fly. There will be no accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No collisions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Anywhere it will be... Not only flies. The birds, when they flock together, so there is no collision. And they very forcibly go like this, this, this, this, all together, but you won't find one accident. And this is Kṛṣṇa's inconceivable energy. What you can do? You cannot fly hundreds of planes at a time. There will be at least three, four accidents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They have great difficulty doing these air displays. Many planes flying together, these air displays. There is so much difficulty for them. A lot of them, they have accidents. Also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly I used to see three, four, more than four flies going together. Nowadays I do not see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Flies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, aeroplanes. During wartime when they used to come to bombard they used to come in four, five together because the enemies, they used to shot down. So if one is shot down the other will be bombing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> You wrote in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, that in outer space there are those giant birds like eagle. Very, very big. Giant size. Enormous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They go from one planet to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> It is like a big plane. Bigger than jet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And while flying they lay down eggs. And the eggs, while falling down, they become birds. By the, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Friction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. When they, what it is called. Velocity of falling down, it becomes fomented, and then the birds come out. Just like parasites. No? Parachute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, parachute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> While falling down, it opens. This is God's creation. Inconceivable. And that aeroplane, flying machine, is so perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And it will find its own food.</div>
