<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The authorities say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It says that.... [break] ...possibility of an object staying in motion unless there's a person to move it. So therefore the conclusion is that these planets cannot stay in motion unless there is a supreme mover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he accepts God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...the fact that there's no need to worship God, the fact that there's a need to worship man, because man is actually the center of the universe instead of God as the center of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you fight? Why do you fight? Is there no obstacle, why do you fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Simply that it's human nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Worship God by fighting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then it becomes a question of who's the best man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God, but you shouldn't fight with Him. But these rascals say worship man, but why does he fight with man? Another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> [break] Actually there was a boy sitting like that, and a shark came and bit off his leg while he was sitting there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...they still think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...still think that man can decide his own future. He can decide how the universe was made. That's the basic philosophy now, that man is actually the center of the universe. He can decide and make anything he wants. Initially there's no sense in worshiping God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's another philosophy, though. It's called ecology, which is even more popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Zoology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Ecology. They say that man is part of the universe, and that we should take care of the environment because ultimately man will kill himself if he doesn't care for the environment properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The meaning is that people have exploited the atmosphere and the earth so badly in the last two hundred years especially, that, practically speaking, man is on the verge of self-destruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're getting scared because they put so much pollution in the atmosphere, into the water, into the earth, that now they're.... Everything's.... It's reacting against them now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In other words, they're seeing that they've become a problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was telling you about that blob of garbage that was left out in the..., headed towards the harbor in New York. For the last fifty years they've dumped all the garbage in the sea, and now it's collected together, and it's coming back into the shore. They think that in about fifteen years time, if it travels at its present rate, it will be blocking the entire New York Harbor. So ecology means they have to try to find out ways and means of avoiding things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Useless waste products. They've discovered new ways in science how to use things which can be used and used again and again. For example, newspapers, instead of throwing them away, they can recycle them and make new newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They also say they were going to recycle their own urine and stool and use it over and over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Like in the spaceship. When they go to the moon they recycle their own urine and drink it over again. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the most popular philosophy is (inaudible).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Madman. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Man has created so many problems in the environment, so they don't think that the problem is man's way of doing things, or its heart. They simply consider if we can make some adjustments in the environment, then everything will go on very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will try to make adjustments with material nature, everything will be failure. <span class="Italic">...hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā.</span> They'll never be able to adjust. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> chewing the chewed. That's all. [break] ...adjustment to lie down in the skyscraper, and now they are coming. Why they have come to the ground? <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita.</span> Sometimes on the ground, sometimes the sky. [break] They reject the stool and urine and then accept it. They do like that. (laughing) [break] It is rejected. It cannot be utilized. In India still the system is they use metal; when it is broken you can sell it. They take half price and supply new.... They use metal pots, and the (inaudible) is that when it is broken and old we can exchange with new plates. And this kind of bowls you have to throw away. You cannot utilize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So they break very easily?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> These plates, the silverware and things that people use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever (unclear). Silver is not half price. Silver, little less than new one. They purchase one rupee less. It was 200 rupees new, and the purchaser will take 190 (unclear) ...India they use (unclear). Bell metal, copper...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Aluminium is becoming very popular now, aren't they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't use aluminium much. If they have got excess money, they invest in metal-gold, silver, copper, bell metal.... Immediate loan-you can mortgage the metal pots, the metal ornaments, you get money immediately. [break] ...in a year, that is a metal purchasing ceremony. Every family will purchase, according to his means, some metal pots once in a year. <span class="Italic">Dhantraivesi(?) (indistinct)</span> means desire some funds. So if there's some extra money-not big, big men; middle class storeman-they invest in metal purchase. If there is a good business day, (unclear) all the utensils (unclear). You know Diwali, Diwali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just one day before Diwali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huge quantity of metals. Everyone will count (indistinct) (end)</div>
