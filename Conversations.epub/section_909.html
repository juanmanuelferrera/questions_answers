<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say about the Westerners, you do not know? They say <span class="Italic">paścime lokā mūla nacaḥ.(?)</span> The Western people, they are rascals and misbehaved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Misbehaved, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paścime loka mūla nacaḥ.(?) </span>This means from India, the farther you go to the western side you'll find only rascals and misbehaved. From Punjab you go to Afghanistan and then Iran then so on, so on, Europe. These are <span class="Italic">paścima,</span> Western people. <span class="Italic">Paścime loka mūla nacaḥ.</span> Actually he meant it for Indian <span class="Italic">paścima,</span> east and west. You came before here, New Vrindaban?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> Yes, I was here, but a long time ago, when they just had the little farm, about six years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's back in Europe. This letter's from Germany. He mentions that he's getting some more buses and about fifteen more men to come along with some preaching equipment. They plan on leaving early August and are reaching there late August sometime. And so far he mentions that he still has no definite idea how to keep the buses in India, so the other buses will be coming out and two more buses will be coming in. This is his plan. Then he mentions that he had some correspondence with Lokanātha Swami, who's heading up the traveling party while he's in Europe, and Lokanātha Swami mentions they've been doing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> in Darmashala on the way up to Sri Nagar, Kashmir. And he says they are doing well everywhere they go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India, everywhere they'll be received very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> distribution has now been started as a regular part of the program. And they did one program in a town called Dalialama. Immediately two monks and one British hippie joined the party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two monks means Buddhist monks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Possibly. And he mentions in the last two weeks after we left Vṛndāvana we picked eight devotees, so they must have more devotees by now. The emphasis on their program he mentions is to make devotees and responsible preachers to carry on the Indian mission. And then he says that we've been advertising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Advertising?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like this. He says "I want to make one banner and poster: 'Now you can join the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Travel all over the world preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> All expenses paid. Free food, lodging, etc. No qualification necessary. Apply ISKCON.' " It's like army recruiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he mentions the situation in Germany, at least the devotees are becoming a little stronger now. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana</span> is going on nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all that we want. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana</span> must go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Devotees here now Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Baltimore, St. Louis, about seven vans from the Rādhā-Dāmodara party, Buffalo, Cleveland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Occupied by devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is doing nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's very eager to train up the new men, he mentioned in his last letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is devotee. Nasty government. If somebody wants to give donation, a car, not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Where is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, if you want to give one car donation, they'll not allow. They'll charge 230 paisa(?). (indistinct) Very nasty government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Everywhere you go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Everywhere now is nasty government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dasyu-dharma,</span> rogues and thieves, they'll... Government means people in general, they are losing their independence. Personal independence, nil. Russia, cent percent, no personal independence. Simply like animals who live. (end)</div>
