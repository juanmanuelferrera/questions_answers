<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you go to a medical man do you ask him whether he is Christian or Hindu? I am asking you. Suppose you go to a medical man, do you ask him, "Are you Christian or Muslim or Hindu?" Do you ask him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am asking this girl. Why? Because your business is to cure your disease. It doesn't matter whether he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Muhammadan. It doesn't matter. Similarly, you have to seek love of God. Wherever it is available, you have to take it. That should be the point of view. It doesn't matter where it is available. One should be hankering after love of Godhead. Love of God. Gold, somebody is after purchasing gold. It doesn't matter where it is available. Similarly, it doesn't matter whether you develop love of Godhead from this scripture or that scripture. Your aim should be whether you are developing love of Godhead or developing love of non-God. That should be the test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (older woman):</span> Divine Master, I came to pay my respect and I'm most distressed that I need to leave, but there is series of people who are waiting for me, for a spiritual meeting also. So permit me to bow to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. Please come again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Take some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you did not question anything, if you have got any doubts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I beg your pardon? (devotees explain Prabhupāda's question) Do I have any doubts? Divine Master, you have made me able to read my heart. I have no pretensions to speak one way or another. There is no doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> She said there is no doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. (mild laughter) (end)</div>
