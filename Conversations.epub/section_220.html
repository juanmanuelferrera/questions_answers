<div class="Purp-para">(Prabhupāda converses in Hindi with guests)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> This is <i class="calibre3">mung dahl</i> for you, Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Is it split?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Split yellow <i class="calibre3">mung.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> No, I think this is <i class="calibre3">urad dahl.</i> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...big squash thrown away decomposes. So the outer skin has become dry. Nobody cares for it. It is lying down, the outer cover of the squash, and one dried bamboo. You have seen, you know bamboo? Pile cut, it is also lying somewhere. And a piece of wire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Wire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Wire, that is also lying somewhere. Nobody cares. But one gentleman, he collected all these three things and prepared a string instrument. He joined the bamboo with the dry cover of squash and fitted the string and it began to <i class="calibre3">ting, ting, ting.</i> It is called <i class="calibre3">ektara</i>. There is instrument in India it is called <i class="calibre3">ektara.</i> The example is that so many things individually lying useless. But if somebody knows how to combine them, it becomes an instrument, very sweet. Very sweet to hear. Similarly, in this world, so many things are lying dead and frustrated. But if they are combined together by an expert, it becomes useful. So although this world is dead body, when there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it becomes enlivened. That is our movement. We are trying to inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness in everything dead within this world. (Prabhupāda drinks) Now just see all these ingredients, strawberry and..., what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Orange juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Orange and honey...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Peach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...and peach, they are natural products from the jungle. Nobody goes to manufacture, automatically comes out. But when they are combined together, it is nectarean. None of them is manufactured by man, either this honey or the strawberry or the pineapple. Given by God. So in every step, you can perceive the hands of God. Every step. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This nice taste you cannot create by any chemical combination. It is not possible. Because God's hand is there, it has become so tasteful drink. Man cannot make. This flower, man cannot make. This fruit... Nothing man can make. This nice flower stick, how nicely it is made. So everything you can perceive the hands of God. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When you perceive the hands of God, presence of God, presence of the energy of God, then you become happy. That is the way of happiness. In every step of life, you feel the hands of God. We are teaching..., this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means how to perceive, realize presence of God in everything. So there will be no disappointment. (to guests:) Take more? Go on eating. <i class="calibre3">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Īśo mantra 1]<i class="calibre3">. </i>Everything there is. Actually that is a fact. People are so foolish. They are not trained up to understand the presence of God in everything. So we are training that status of life to perceive presence of God in everything. In everything. (pause) This is called peach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Um hm. Like those trees we saw on the walk this morning.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Cherries.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Fat. Vegetable fat? It is fatty. These fruits are meant for offering to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <i class="calibre3">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam. </i>Flowers, leaves, fruits He wants. So these are Kṛṣṇa's food. <i class="calibre3">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam<span class="Italic"></span></i> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 9.26]<i class="calibre3">.</i> (devotee enters) What is your problem of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> We're miserable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> We're miserable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why miserable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> We never get satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. It is good sign, because then you will be searching after the source of satisfaction. The source of satisfaction is Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Śānti. Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 5.29]<i class="calibre3">.</i> When you know Kṛṣṇa as the friend of everyone, at that time you get satisfaction. How nice. Everything is so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Just see how bright this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> ...how bright these flowers are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Wherefrom this beauty, nice flower, nice leaves, everything comes? Wherefrom? So I shall have to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> The television show is at seven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakta dāsa:</b> Yes, seven o'clock. Would you still like to go for a drive and see some of the city? The car is all ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (to guest) Take more. Come to our temple daily in the morning at seven. Are you coming there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yes. I was staying at the Detroit temple with Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> I was helping the band a little bit. And I came to see you, and I was wondering what I should do to serve you. I should go back to Detroit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Or you can remain here also, anywhere. We have got temple in Los Angeles. Have you been in Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So come to Los Angeles and stay there for some time. I am going to Los Angeles tomorrow, so you can come. Live with us and you will be happy. We can guarantee you will be happy. Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Our Vedic mission is <i class="calibre3">sarve sukhino bhavantu:</i> everyone be happy. This is our mission. And we know how to become happy. That is our credit. We know. How to become happy we know. Therefore, you can inform others also how to become happy. Happiness is our birthright.<i class="calibre3"> Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</i> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<i class="calibre3">.</i> Living entity is <i class="calibre3">ānandamaya,</i> full of happiness, but they have fallen in a different condition. Therefore unhappy. Different condition. Just like fish taken out of the water and put into the land, a different condition, and it is throbbing, flapping, unhappy. Take it, put it in the water again, and it will be happy. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> I don't want to take too much of your time up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Thank you very much. (end)</div>
