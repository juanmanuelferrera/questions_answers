<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman Devotee:</span> I'm trying to collect for making vases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> She's making vases, flower arrangements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> ...only had one sweeper so I wasn't able to engage him, but I got some soda to do it with. Hopefully today this morning he will start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bicycle was available, forty-five rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> <span class="Italic">Accha.</span> Now they're 250 almost three hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And very first class bicycle like Triumph BA. BA? What is that, BS?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> BSA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, BSA. Eighty rupees, eighty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Viśvambhara's cost 500.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now that must be. Everything has risen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smarahari:</span> ....material is not so good also, the material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smarahari:</span> The steel is not so good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) Now, (degraded?)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Price has risen and quality has lessened. (pause) Prabhupāda, you know the ISKCON centres you have started they are just like actually Vaikuṇṭha, they are so nice. Even the Gauḍīya Matha centres were not so nice. Just like an installation of Vaikuṇṭha. They're so clean and nice. (indistinct) ...help becoming devotees by visiting your centers. Becomes almost automatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Follow the regulative principles, it will remain, always Vaikuṇṭha. Otherwise again material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Free hotel. (laughs) That's all. And free hotel will not endure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.</span> By service spirit beginning with tongue Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then everything is revealed, Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere... Sethji has not come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Of course we accept, ah, when you tell us to chant sixteen rounds, we accept that figure as being, in perfect faith, that you're the <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> but ah, what if others we wanted to convince, is there any, any ah, <span class="Italic">śāstr...</span> Is there any Vedic verse we can refer to to corroborate that at least they must chant sixteen rounds. Or that many number of names?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is not said like that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is said, <span class="Italic">śaṅkhy-pūrvakaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> <span class="Italic">Śaṅkhy-pūrvakaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must fix up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Counting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must fix up in numerical strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I have fixed up sixteen rounds, because you cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> That's all we can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (smiling, touch of irony) Yes. That also is difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, Haridāsa Ṭhākura was chanting 300,000. So, That is not possible. You should not imitate, but whatever you fix up you must do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes. I was told in the beginning you asked the first disciples to chant 64 rounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I asked them to chant 32?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (grinning) Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śaṅkhy-pūrvaka nāma-gaṇa-natibhiḥ. Śaṅkhya purva,</span> or numerical strength must be there. And you should follow rigidly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> So if, if we are serious and sincere, it means that that sixteen will increase to, ah, to continuously chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do also now. It's not that because I've finished sixteen rounds...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can increase. But that sixteen must be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes. (pause) What I mean is, that's to bring us to the platform of chanting constantly. That at least we do that numerical number, finally we may be able to do, if we're fortunate to chant constantly day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Some of the members of the Gauḍīya Matha who say they chant 64 rounds, they are unable to ah, ahh, refrain from sleeping too much, from eating too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you know that he's eating too much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> I was staying at one about a year ago. When I was travelling I stayed a few days at some of the places. At night they would have a whole meal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> ...big, big meal. They would be sitting eating for one hour. Then in the morning they were all tired and very dull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh huh. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Then again at lunch time and after that again sleep. They couldn't do anything else, there was no time for preaching or for distributing books or... But yet they were supposed to be doing 64 rounds. That was in Vishakapatnam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> They were all very fat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Five to seven. ...here now. I've never been there but I heard there are a lot.. reports Cit-sukhānanda prabhu is there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Haa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> ...(Gauḍīya Maṭha) devotees, your godbrothers and the older devotees are all looking to be pretty alright, but the younger ones, our age, they are unable to continue...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa (to a bypasser).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> ...keep the standard. And many of them they have tried to come and join us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Many of them, they ask to join us even though they are initiated by others. So should we allow them to come or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> No. That's what I thought. I wasn't sure about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they want to join?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Because in their centers there's no, there doesn't seem to be so much transcendental activity like you have given us. They don't get that. And if they come and see us they see the devotees are dancing and happy and engaged. The conditions are clean and so on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, you can try one or two. If you find that they're alright...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes. Doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) We can purchase some of those fields but where is the man? We can grow our own food. (slight pause) They have now learned from the Western countries to run! (jogger goes past) (laughs) And without caring for the field. Hm? Field working is very troublesome and this running is very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Running out of breath. (pause) Meets some one on the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> (mumbling) ...Only Māyāpur, eh, Caitanya Chandrodaya Mandir temple is ahh, undoubtedly, eh, ahh Hari.. ahh, eheḥ, ahh, (mumbles something more)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists say, is there any living entity in the sun globe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> No. They don't, they say there's nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply everything here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Yes. That's what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And especially in Europe and America! (everyone laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa! They say there is nothing. They have gone there? They have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Not very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Not very intelligent... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñāna:</span> ...nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who, who put all this energy there? Where from nitrogen came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñāna:</span> That they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. Therefore they are rascals. They do not know, something, and they are speaking on the subject matter. Is it not nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We know there's no life on the sun because we can look at a fire here and we see there's no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are blind. You have no eyes to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well we have our instruments and we look through...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the use of it? Anything made by rascal, is that perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well it's better than some mythological book!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, book also, you write book and you want to believe, others your book. That is also book. Why do you write scientific book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well they're proven, those other books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is proven? You cannot say what is the chemical there, wherefrom came. Is that proof? "We cannot say." Is that proof?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well we know how they interact. We may not know how they got here but we know what they do once they are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Knowledge means to find out the source. That is knowledge. Where from it comes. There is a good example we studied in our childhood. A child was very intelligent so he was beating on a drum, so he was very much inquisitive, "Where from the sound is coming?" Then he cut the surface... (laughing) That is intelligence. Inquisitive... where from the sound is coming? Although it was childish but that is innate intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Scientists are trying to do that. They are taking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is alright. In future! (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smarahari:</span> The scientists say that the sun is made of certain elements and all the stars they are made of the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you make an imitation sun here? At night so that you may save so many expenses. So much expenses for electric. The rascal. If you know the chemicals then you make it. Ha? What do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smarahari:</span> They say there are many suns... but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's alright. Make you one sun, if you know! Many suns but you have not made anyone of them. You just try to make one, then I shall see your intelligence. Huh? What do you say? Anybody?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> They cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1) (woman):</span> They don't have enough power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Then why do you say nonsense! If you have not enough power there must be somebody powerful than you-you have to admit that-who has made all these things. But you are rascal you have not... You are simply, ahh, what is called? Speculating. That in future we shall be powerful. But the powerful is already there. What is your credit? More powerful-) you cannot conceive even how powerful He a scientist. Huh? Is that alright? What is your value? The already powerful is there, who has manufactured these things. And you are expecting in future you'll be powerful; therefore you are more powerful. Just see their folly. If you are powerful then make it, another imitation sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (half joking) I'm seriously speaking, if we made another one the whole place would become too hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hah. So you are scientist, you protect yourself. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Scientists aren't very intelligent because today he big thing in the country politically is that whole world thinks they are running out of energy on one hand, and on the other hand the whole world believes that the scientists can solve all the problems and get to know the absolute truth but if they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are creating problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, they're creating problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (sounds of lots of birds in background) (stops) Birds and beasts, they're living without any scientists-they're more happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But they're freezing in the cold and they're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no one is freezing. That is you are speaking but they are not freezing. Even int the coldest part of the country, Greenland, the animals are living quite nicely. The birds and many animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if we preach like that to them, then they'll say 'then what's wrong with becoming an animal then'?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? But you are less than an animal. Talking nonsense. Put forward the problems, summarise <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jar-vyādhi</span> solve these problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well we can solve the problem of birth by just killing all the children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) That is not solving, the birth is already there, therefore you are killing. (everyone laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> Birth is still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because there is birth therefore you are killing. So birth problem is not solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, no, no. We're killing before birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this before birth. The child is already there... mother's womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That is you rascal you can say. Unless he has (sic) no life, how it is growing? Such a rascal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's a lump.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they cannot understand. Does a dead child grow? Simply speaking nonsense!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's their whole argument for abortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's alright but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You just finished it! (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but our point is, the birth problem is not solved. If there are unwanted population, you kill them that does not mean the population problem is solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're not actually seeing the actual causes of the problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're not actually seeing the causes of the problems so they're trying to adjust to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're simply trying to make so many adjustments to the problems but they are not solving the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That adjustment is not solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> You said once, putting the weight from your head to your shoulder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda Swami:</span> You are carrying a heavy weight I remember you said once. You're carrying heavy weight here, to take the pain you put it here. Then again back here. But still the weight is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The scientists came up with another one for enjoyment. That they cut this little cord that makes the sperm come into the semen and in this way they can have sex life like anything and they're actually not killing. (Man shouts greeting in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jai! Jaya.</span> Semen, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well they say anyway, that... into the semen so they cut this little cord, that tube or something, that has the semen go into the sperm, so the sperm never gets into the semen. So therefore they can have sex life but they'll be no reproduction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one may check, two may check, what about millions? Supposing they can check in that way, it may be possible for one or two, or a dozen, but what about millions and millions? Nature's way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's if they, they're doing this in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In future. That will solve in future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They were giving prizes to people who are doing this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Like TV sets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mutual 'present' society. (everyone laughing) (front bell of temple ringing as Prabhupāda enters grounds) Hiraṇyakaśipu civilization, and we are presenting Prahlāda civilization. So this is a struggle, but ultimately Prahlāda will come out triumphant. Hare Kṛṣṇa (to bystander) and Hiraṇyakaṣipu will be killed. <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> (Walks into temple) (end).</div>
