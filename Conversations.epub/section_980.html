<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It requires much water. Then sow grains. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is from the previous owner, Prabhupāda. He's agreed to take the grapes away. He is simply finding another place for them. It's part of the contract we made with him that he had to move them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That is the proprietor's land on this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he does not find any land to move the grapes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What was that, Śrīla Prabhupāda? He has so much land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There is a law by which it's very difficult to move grapes anywhere. So he's trying to get permission from the <span class="Italic">maire</span> to do it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...built a big factory here to engage people who were socially misfit, and he was making all kinds of plastic toys. So when we moved in we suggested that he help manufacture Spiritual Sky. So now almost his whole factory is being used. Many young Indian boys who have come to France looking for something, they had no money. So he has employed them here. So they're working, they've brought their families.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're established.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, and he's building them houses. (breaks)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think it's unusual in Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's like this every July and August, very sunny. During these months most people in Europe come to France. [break] ...storage house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does he manufacture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Manufactures boats and plastic things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is box?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Spiritual Sky, incense boxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's a quarry for stone. The same kind of stone that the chateau is built from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This is the factory here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Factory of the proprietor? The proprietor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, and he rents to Spiritual Sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> These incense packs, we are reorganizing the stock now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you are selling?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> We're changing the design on this package, we have Gopal Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is nice, why you are changing it? Unnecessary spending is not... [break] ...the sticks?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> This is coming from India I think. But there's much acacia in France, and so we're going to pick it ourselves. This will make us a producer, which will increase our profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Spiritual Sky is paying right now almost eighty thousand dollars a year to the association here.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> This is the cheaper oil. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> This belongs to the previous owner of the chateau. He let us use these machines. He also helps us make very nice stands for displaying.
