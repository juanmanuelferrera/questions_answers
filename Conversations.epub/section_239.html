<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the subject matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> About yoga has been taught by Vivasvān, and Vivasvān taught to Manu, and Manu taught to Ikṣvāku.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> He said that Vivasvān is the personification of Sūrya, the sun-god. He was the first man created by Brahmā and he learns yoga from (indistinct) himself. And then we..., Vivasvān taught yoga to Manu, who is the creator of the law, and of institutions. Just explaining only the, who is Ikṣvāku, who is Vivasvān, and so on. There's no philosophical explanation. Just word by word explanations. Because of course if you compare...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Personality of Godhead said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, "I spoke this." He says, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham.</span> So Kṛṣṇa says, Bhagavān says that "I spoke". But the translation is that the Brahmā spoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> No. Śrī Bhagavān spoke... Śrī Bhagavān spoke that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrī Bhagavān spoke. But you told me Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> No. Śrī Bhagavān spoke, telling people, telling Arjuna that yoga has been taught by God to Vivasvān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God, God, "By Me." He said that "I taught."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> By him, no, explanations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not explanations. First in the translations.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhagavān, that Bhagavān said that "I spoke." Is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Bhagavān said that yoga has been taught by Me to Vivasvān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "The Blessed Lord said, 'I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun god, Vivasvān. Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu, in turn, instructed it to Ikṣvāku.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what is the explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Herein we find the history of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order, the king of all planets. This science is especially meant for the perfection of the inhabitants, and therefore, the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, the eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Vivasvān is the original person of the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> family, <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Does he mention Vivasvān here? Should I read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> The sun is the king of the planets and the sun god (at present of the name Vivasvān) rules...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the present moment, the president or the predominating person, his name is given, Vivasvān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> He's a person. He's a man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> From <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not from <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span> He's the origin of <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Origin of <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> A thing about the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also mentioned here, in the second verse. It's mentioned also that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the oldest yoga. It's the oldest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the thing is... The explanation: Vivasvān is personification of Sūrya. No. He's person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Person. I see. Yes. Person and ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His name is Vivasvān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The predominating deity in the sun planet, his name is Vivasvān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Vivasvān, yes. And he's supposed to be the originator of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's the original person for the... There are two kinds of <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> One coming from the sun-god, and the other is coming from the moon god, <span class="Italic">candra-vaṁśa, sūrya-vaṁśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> That's a very good correction for us. (Indonesian)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Personification means he... From the explanation it appears that actually there is no person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes. Originally there was person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not was, is, is still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Is still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Their life is long duration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are kings, son of the Manu, they lived for eight, eleven <span class="Italic">arbuda</span> years. One <span class="Italic">arbuda</span> years means ten crores. One crore means ten millions. Ten million. So ten million years makes one crore. Such eleven crore years... There is history (indistinct) one of the Manus, he reigned over for eleven <span class="Italic">arbuda</span> years. One <span class="Italic">arbuda</span> means ten millions of years. So Vivasvān, Vivasvān he's living for so many years. Just like Brahmā's age is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You find out the verse, <span class="Italic">sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. </span>8.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is the Chapter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Chapter 8, 17.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chapter 8, 17th verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. </span>8.17]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what is the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "By human calculations..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I want to know this (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> He who knows that the day of Brahmā is thousand <span class="Italic">yuga</span> and that the night of Brahmā is also 5,000 <span class="Italic">yugas</span> is he who knows the truth of day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, what is the explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> The explanation is that, according to the traditions that Brahmā, the day or the night of Brahmā's is one thousand <span class="Italic">yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">yuga?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> It's mentioned in Chapter 4, 8. Four, verse eight. <span class="Italic">Yuga</span> is eighths, one <span class="Italic">yuga</span> is, it's written here a hundred years. One <span class="Italic">yuga</span> is one eighths between the one incarnations to another incarnations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he has not given actual calculation of the years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> The years, he mentioned here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Only the <span class="Italic">yuga</span> of..., Kṛta-yuga is four thousand years. And Tretā-yuga is three thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Dvāpara-yuga is two thousand years, and Kali-yuga is one thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thousand years? (laughs) We have already passed five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Wait. Oh. There is one thousand years, god's years. If it is human years it is four million three thousand, three hundred twenty thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Total. There is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Four millions and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the total <span class="Italic">yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes, in human years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Human calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indonesian Scholar: :</span>Four million three thous... four, three, two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About forty-three. About forty-three hundred thousands of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Forty-three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundred thousands of years. That makes it <span class="Italic">yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> <span class="Italic">Yuga,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Brahmā's daytime is such forty three hundred thousands of years multiplied by one thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> One thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-three hundred thousands of years multiplied by one thousand. So forty-three hundred thousand... That forty three, five zeros, and again three zeros. Then how... what it comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Forty-three millions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Forty-three, five zero, upon forty-three, add eight zeros. Then what it comes to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> (Indonesian) Billion. Four billions of years, four billion years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four billion years is twelve hours of Brahmā's life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Just one day only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One day only. Similarly one night. Then one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Eight billion years one day of Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda;:</span> Yes. So that is the calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So things are very complicated, and people should understand very rightly. They are, they are frog philosophy. Frog philos... We say frog philosophy. Frog philosophy means that a frog who lives in the well, he has got experience of water, three cubic feet. And if he's given to understand that there is Atlantic Ocean, it is very difficult for him to understand. So on the whole, it is... But it is not very completely explained. And our point is this, or at least it will give some idea of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still it has to be expanded, has to be more explicitly ex..., advertised. So our point is this, that we are trying to spread this knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means that we are spreading the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So this is a world-wide organization and you know something about us, about this movement. So this part of the world, this is Southeast Asia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Southeast Asia. Why not combine it, join together, and scientifically preach this cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. People will be very glad to accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> What is the place of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> here, in this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is... The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the preliminary study of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Just like before learning any literature, one has to read the first book, ABCD. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the ABCD. It is just beginning of understanding of what is God. ABC. When one has passed the entrance examination, then he gets the opportunity of studying <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the last instruction is <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is explaining Himself, and at last He says that you surrender unto me. That is the most confidential part of knowledge. So if one has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, then He's admitted in the college of studying <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Before that he has no place. Just like without passing entrance examination, nobody's admitted in the college course. Similarly, without understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> perfectly well, one cannot understand what is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Bhāgavata</span> is the graduate study. So this <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> is the summarized study of all Vedic knowledge. And <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the explanation of <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> So people are in darkness about this great knowledge and the science of God, all over the world. They are misled. They're being misled. Misled in this way, that this human form of life is specially meant for understanding God. The animals are not very (indistinct), but the present leaders they're keeping all the human being in the animal condition of life. Their chance of becoming conscious about God is being sacrificed, being misled, by so-called economic development, plans. All this economic development means, they're meant for this bodily comforts. Any department of knowledge at the present moment, they're simply aiming at giving some artificial comfort to this body. But these rascals, they do not care to know that however I keep this body comfortably, I'll have to give it up. And after giving up this body, what is my next position, they do not know. They do not know. This is darkness. This is darkness. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an educational movement to give enlightenment to the people at large, to understand the values of life. Not to live like animals, eating, sleeping, sex life and dying. This is animal life. This is the best humanitarian welfare activities: to make people understand scientifically what he is, what is God, what is our relationship with God. So the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the preliminary study of this science. So this should be presented very scientifically. One who knows perfectly well about this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> These are the (indistinct) crucial point. That one... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> There's so many very touch(?) point. If they are not very, explained nicely people will remain in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> But we think in the present day, Indonesia's, we think about harmonizing spiritual and material aspects of life, this our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. Harmonize means... First of all you must know what is harmonization. Harmonization means that this material life means bodily concept of life. This is material life. "I am this body." Generally people think like that: "I am Indonesian." "I am American." "I am Hindu." "I am Muslim." And they take care of the country where he's born. <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tridhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijyadhīḥ,</span> but this conception, bodily conception of life, has made the whole human society like cats and dogs. "It is my land. It is my..." Just like a dog. As soon as another dog comes. "Bark, bark, bark, bark. Why you have come here? Why you have come here." So this, this kind of harmonization is dog civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Well I think it's the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. No. You cannot... First of all you have to understand what is spiritual value of life. Then you can harmonize. If you do not know what is spiritual life, then what you can harmonize? That is the teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> In the beginning, when Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as guru, then He began to explain about the value of life. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> find out this verse. It's in the Second Chapter. Which verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Two, thirteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Second Chapter, thirteenth verse. Find out. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tattva na muhyati [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> "After using this body, from childhood to youth and to old age and afterwards changes into another body. He who is wise, will not be, will not be disturbed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, here is the indication that after death we have to accept another body. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, what kind of body you are going to accept? There are 8,400,000 varieties of bodies. Is it not? Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> No, we don't know that. (indistinct) varieties of bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are forms of body in the water, in the land, so many trees, plants and there are so many insects, reptiles. Then birds, then there are beasts, then there are human being. So there are 8,400,000 forms of body. Here it is indicated that after giving up this body, the soul is going to accept another body. Now the human civilization, is it not duty of the human society to know what kind of body I am going to accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> No, I think it's up to God and <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then they must know what is <span class="Italic">karma-phala.</span> This is a fact. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> But they are..., do not know how to execute <span class="Italic">karma.</span> They're doing all kinds of sinful activities. So, suppose after this body, on account of my sinful activities, I am going to become a rat or cat or snake or a tree, then what is the use of my so much, how you'd say, jumping over nationalism and this ism and that. If by nature I am going to accept next life the body of a cat and dog, or a tree, then what is the meaning of my, this so-called nationality at the present moment? Is it not the duty of the guardians who are taking care of the people or their son, to educate human being in such a way that they can get better body? What is that education? You are darkness, nobody knows what kind of body he's going to accept next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> At least we can start from living moral life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they're not living, they're not living. They are doing all kinds of sinful activities, they are drinking, they are having illicit sex, they're gambling, they're killing animals. Very sin... Everyone is engaged in these things. Maybe few percentage people are not engaged. But the throughout the whole world they're implicated in these four kinds of sinful activities. How you can expect that he's going to have next body very nice? No. That is not possible if you believe in <span class="Italic">karma.</span> According to <span class="Italic">karma...</span> Just like here in the human society there is law that if you kill a man, you should be also killed. Similarly, in God's laws so the same law is there. <span class="Italic">Māṁ sa, māṁsa.</span> If I eat an animal then he will have the chance to eat me next life. This is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Who is caring for all these things? Who is caring? Nobody's caring. They're slaughtering animals like anything. So this kind of adjustment will not help. They must know scientifically what is the value of life. They must take information from authorized scriptures. Then the human society will be profitable. Otherwise no. Just like there is next life, a boy is educated to have good education so that in the next life-means when he's young man-he will be happy. He's preparing for the next life. The boy is being educated. That means he's preparing for the next youthful life. Youthful life is meant for preparation for the next old age life. Then what we are preparing now for the next body? That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yānti deva-vratā devān<br class="calibre2"/>pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhutāni yānti bhūtejyā<br class="calibre2"/>yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.25]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So where is that education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> I think it's also according to the society. First we have to learn and after we come to the stage of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> only then we are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is no question of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa, sannyāsa</span> you take or not take, you must be in knowledge what is your next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> But if the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you mean to say we shall keep ourself in darkness about our next life? Is that your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Well I think we have to start from... We give a child educations and then <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right, <span class="Italic">gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> that is a, different stages. But the real education is that you have to die. You have to accept another body. What kind of body you are going to accept? If you do not know that what is this meaning of <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?</span> It is all rascal. If you do not... You miss this real point, then what is the meaning of this? There's no meaning. Simply by dressing in white cloth one becomes <span class="Italic">gṛhastha?</span> And simply by dressing one, in this saffron cloth, he becomes <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> By changing dress he becomes everything? He must know, that what is the aim of life. Everyone should know what is the ultimate of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he does not know, if he is in darkness for the next life, then what is the meaning of this <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> and this...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> We believe in the stage of life so we prepare from childhood and after ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, not only we, but everyone should prepare from the childhood. This is... This <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not meant for a particular class of men. It is meant for the human society. So this education should be spread all over the world to save them from pitfalls of a life of darkness. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We do not mean that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is meant for the Hindus, or for the Indians, or for the Indonesians. No, no, it is meant for everyone. They should know the science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Are there Christian also, or Muslim also joining this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What's this? Can't you see? There are many Christians, many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Do they have to be Hindus first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, why you are stressing to become Hindu and Christian? It is that education for understanding the values of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of Hindu, Muslim. Any intelligent man will take it. Suppose if you want to be a great mathematician does it mean that you must be a Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> But by using threads, attributes of Hindu religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, actually... Hindu, the word is not to be found in our Vedic scripture. It is the name given by the Mohammedans. So that is going on. Actually it is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> four <span class="Italic">varṇas,</span> four <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> The four <span class="Italic">varṇas,</span> the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> And four <span class="Italic">āśramas-brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> Combined together it is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> So unless the human being follows this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> principle he's not a human being. He's animal, because animal has no <span class="Italic">varṇa</span>, no <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> The human society must be divided. Then, just like in this body there are four divisions-the head division, the arms division, the belly division, and the leg division-all these are required for complete body. Although, by comparative study, head is the most important department, but still the leg is not... that we don't require leg. Leg is also required. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra</span>, they're required to function the society perfectly. That is <span class="Italic">varṇa.</span> And similarly, for spiritual emancipation there must be the division: <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> So unless you accept this institution perfectly you cannot develop your consciousness as perfect human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> This divisions only in Hindus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this division is meant for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Mohammedans also accept this divisions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes. They're accepting. If you don't accept any scientific truth that is your business. That is your business. If you say-two plus two equal to four-"No I don't accept." That is your business. But two plus two equal to four, that is a fact everywhere. Now how these boys have accepted? Now they have got sacred thread, they have become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they're acting actually as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> There are many Mohammedans also. You came from Mohammedan. So it is the process of presenting the perfect educational system. Then everyone will accept. Any intelligent man will accept. It is a science. So you have to push this scientific movement throughout the whole world. That is our program. It is not a so-called Hindu cult or a Indian cult. No. It is science to be accepted by everyone if he at all wants to, I mean to say, purify or make his life perfect. Otherwise, he's in darkness. He does not know what he's going to accept another body. He has to accept another body, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> It does not say that this kind of body, <span class="Italic">dehāntaram,</span> another body. Not..., it is up to you to select what kind of body I am going to accept. I am going to become a cat or dog or a demigod or a big man or a... They do not know yet. This science is unknown to the whole world. We are trying to push on this scientific movement. This is our position. So if you want to cooperate with this scientific movement, then we are prepared. But if you have some other idea, that is different thing. But if we take it seriously as a scientific movement, then we are prepared to cooperate. And if (you) should do, simply formality will not help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> I think we think our stage has not yet come to that level because <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> only, still very few understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People are in darkness. You mean to say when you said that we have not come to that stage, that means that you want to remain in darkness? Does it mean? You don't want to take this light. You have not come to this stage. Does it mean you want to remain in darkness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Well, not really. But step by step we have to enlighten ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But step by step... You have to know it. Step by step is there. First of all you have to fix up that we have, this is the goal. Then we get step by step. But if you don't accept the principle, then you remain in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> I think the principle is the same but by the way to perform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Your principle is to teach the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then you have to take the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you want to read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> but you remain in other atmosphere then it will not help. It is simply waste of time. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ janayati</span> [SB 1.2.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is also there. I'm talking to the most confidential part of this knowledge. <span class="Italic">Sarva-guhyatamam.</span> What is that? Find out. The Eighteenth Chapter. I think sixty-three verse. What is that verse sixty-three?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Iti te jñānam ākhyātam,</span> "Thus I have explained to you the most confidential of all knowledge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before that verse. <span class="Italic">Sarva-guhyatamam.</span> Ah, yes, yes. Sixty-three. Just open to sixty-three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Sixty-three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it. [break]</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(end of first side of tape)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> (indistinct) probably do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Whatever you like. That independence is there always. But he has... Just like we are speaking. This is the aim of life. Now if you like then take, you'll not take-that depends on your independence. So that independence is all... Before that independence is there, therefore we are sometimes degrading from this human life to cats' and dogs' life. So it is the duty of the human society to save the human being to degrade, from becoming again cats and dogs, or to elevate him higher and higher. Does it mean that we are, we shall be satisfied with our present stage of life without knowing what we are going to accept? Is that very nice proposal? Or we shall try to elevate the human society, that is higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Our aim is the same, to elevate the human being, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then you have to accept the means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you do not accept the means, simply expecting that our aim is the same, will not act. You have to accept the means. That means, it is explained in the next verse, sixty-four, <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is that? Sixty-four?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Sixty-four, <span class="Italic">sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ, iṣṭo 'si me dṛḍham iti tato vakṣyāmi te hitam.</span> Then sixty-five, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">, mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo 'si me</span>. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one has to become... If one is actually eager and serious for fulfilling the aim of human life then he has to take to this principle of Kṛṣṇa consciousness<span class="Italic">-man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru, mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo 'si me.</span> This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So one has to become, if one is actually eager and serious for fulfilling the aim of human life, then he has to take to this principle of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru, mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo 'si me [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you do not teach this lesson to the human society then he will remain in the darkness. This is the purport. This is the purpose of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām</span> here means Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Or Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you bring Brahmā? Then you have not understood Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> We are asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are asking? Because you do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> (indistinct) here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are asking because you do not understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Because it's mentioned here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He says <span class="Italic">mām.</span> He says everything <span class="Italic">mām, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">, mām eva,</span> everything <span class="Italic">mām,</span> "I". So why you should bring Brahmā? Kṛṣṇa says everything "I". You are asking about Kṛṣṇa. That means you do not understand Kṛṣṇa. But it is clearly said <span class="Italic">mām,</span> Kṛṣṇa. We have, therefore, given the name "Kṛṣṇa consciousness", nothing else, neither Brahmā consciousness, nor God consciousness. "Kṛṣṇa consciousness." The whole concentration is to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> The explanation here is that from this <span class="Italic">śloka</span> to the seventy-two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> From this <span class="Italic">śloka...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which this <span class="Italic">śloka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> From sixty-four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> To seventy-two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Kṛṣṇa gains or speaks as a guru, <span class="Italic">guru-śiṣya-samudbhava.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Kṛṣṇa is the original guru, (indistinct) guru for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> So here is as a guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru is the representative of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore guru will also teach to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> From this movement what has been, what is the plan, and what is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone should become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is the plan. That is the whole plan. That is stated. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, this is <span class="Italic">man-manā,</span> always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. This Kṛṣṇa chanting means thinking of Kṛṣṇa, immediately, <span class="Italic">man-manā. Mad-bhaktaḥ,</span> there is in the temple, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa deity, they are worshiping. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī,</span> they are regularly, according to the rules and regulations from morning to up to ten, there is worshiping method. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">,</span> offer your obeisances. Then you come back to Me. That is perfection. They do not know where they are going, whether they are going to be cats and dogs. But here by this process you go back to home, back to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore this should be adopted. Why should you spoil your energy to become cats and dogs? This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> It's time for real life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real life. That is real life, to go back to Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise you do not know where you are going. After all, you're preparing for something next. But your energy is being spoiled because do not know. But if you become <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-yājī,</span> always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, is it very difficult? <span class="Italic">Man-manā.</span> You think of Kṛṣṇa, you worship Kṛṣṇa, you are going to the temple, you're offering some prayers. That's all right. What is the difficulty if you offer the prayer to Kṛṣṇa? You have to do the same thing in a systematic way. Then <span class="Italic">mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām [Bg. 9.25],</span> then you go back to Kṛṣṇa. Next life is to go back to home, back to Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Well, I think the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also mentions that many ways lead to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Many ways, that is all right. But the best way He suggests who comes back to Me. (chuckles) Many ways, there may be. You can go to hell, that is also another way. Therefore He says in the sixty-..., seven, <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān pari...</span> "I have already suggested many ways. You give up, kick up all these ways. You simply surrender unto Me." That is the most confidential part of knowledge. So intelligent man should take it. And still if he likes many ways let him do that. Let him go to hell. Who can check it? <span class="Italic">Yānti deva vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ... [Bg. 9.25].</span> He has suggested. You can go to the higher planetary system, you can remain here, you can become cats, you can become dogs, you can become <span class="Italic">bhūta,</span> ghost. You can become anything you like, but if you become <span class="Italic">mad-yājī</span>, if you become a devotee of Me, then you come to me. Now it is up to..., our position to make choice whether he is going to be a ghost, or become, going to become the associates of Kṛṣṇa. (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> What is His Divine Grace idea about Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kali-yuga means degraded age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> It's the time for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Degradation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> It's the time for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It has begun for the last 5,000 years. It's going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> And how long it will be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it will remain for another 427,000's of years. The whole duration is 432,000's of years, out of which we have passed only 5,000 years. That means the balance is 427,000 years. So at the end, people will forget everything about God. There are descriptions of the Kali-yuga. So if we again come back to Kali-yuga, it is not very good for us. The symptoms have already begun. So actually, we must do something by which people may derive some benefit. Simply for formalities there is no value. And that, things are already mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You have to simply follow the program, then life will be perfect. (Hindi) Fruit. Give them this <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> this fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> How long this movement has been started?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This movement started from since 5,000 years, since Kṛṣṇa appeared. We have not start... manufactured this movement. We are just pushing on the same movement, rightly, that's all. We can say how long this movement has been started rightly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> means little. The others may come, what will be such and such, again you have to bring, till somebody comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We'll be going shortly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but if somebody comes, again you have to go, bring back. People are not come here to fill up their bellies. (laughs) Little <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> that will satisfy. Only one piece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> This movement started all over the world now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> How many countries for instance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole world. Especially in America. America, Europe. From here we are going New Zealand, Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Are they in Arabic countries also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arabic countries also, our men from (indistinct) that is an Arabic country. We send to Pakistan also, but due to this war, the American Embassy, they asked us to (indistinct). We are going again, Bangladesh. We have got Russia and we are negotiating with China also. So because you are here, you have taken the importance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, why not do it rightly and propagate nicely. That is our proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> We will think about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Think about it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you have to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) around 7. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> (indistinct) life after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, bring (indistinct). Call him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He has left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he has left, all right. You come here, near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Life after death, he is asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is life after death. This is your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That whether there is life after death. What is your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your opinion? It is a fact. Just like you are a child, now you are a young man. So you have changed your body. Similarly, when you change this body, you get another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Life after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is life after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is there any world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Any description of the worlds...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> World is vast. So according to your <span class="Italic">karma...</span> Just like you have got a particular type of body. You are young man, there is another young man also. Still, his body and your body is not exactly the same. His bodily feature, your bodily feature, his intelligence, your intelligence, they are all different. But a child grows to become young man, that's a fact. You are a child, another child was there. So they have got now different body. Just like you have got a different body from your childhood life. Is it not? But you know that you had a childhood body, although the body is not there. This is transmigration from one body to another. Just like a dream at night. You change this body. You accept another body. And although you're lying down on your bed, you've gone to some other place. Subtle body. Take for... This is a fact that we change our bodies so many ways, but I, the soul, I remain. So therefore, when this body will not exist I'll exist in another body. That is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, na jāyate na mriyate vā, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> We can experience this, and it is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> After destruction of this body we are not disturbed. I, as living entity, I remain, I accept another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Maybe the question is that whether the life after death is the same like our life here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, but, that is not (indistinct). If you get another body, naturally the same way of life. Same way of life means this life... This material body means four functions: eating, sleeping, sex intercourse, and defense. So as soon as you take another body, it's the same business (indistinct). It may be dog's life, it may be cat's life, or it may be human life. But the business is the same: eating, sleeping, sex intercourse and defense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> And the idea of <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa,</span> and soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. That is an... That you have to prepare. That is not for the cats and dogs. That is meant for really human beings, those who are actually executing life as human beings. That is not for the cats and dogs. (pause) All right. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Scholar:</span> Thank you for this time.</div>
