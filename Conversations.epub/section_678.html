<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Society has lost this <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> process; therefore they remain in the animal platform. <span class="Italic">Janman jāyate śūdra saṁskārad bhaved dvijaḥ.</span> When a person is born even in human society, he remains a <span class="Italic">śūdra. Śūdra</span> means almost like animal. Now he has to be reformed. That is called <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> Then twice-born. The first-class twice-born is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Second-class twice-born is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> And third-class twice-born is the <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> And remaining, who cannot be reformed, they remain <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But there is cooperation between <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,</span> and the society makes progress simultaneously for everyone. That is human society. At the present moment mostly all of them remain <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> or less..., <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> So how there can be any peace? It is not possible. There is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> maybe a few <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> only. They are also half-reformed. And European culture, that is <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> culture, <span class="Italic">yavana</span> culture. There is no reformation, no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> no <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> simply <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas</span> mostly <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is means for thoroughly overhauling the whole human society. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They think it is freedom to be able to do whatever you feel, whatever you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, where is your freedom? You are kicked out like football from one life to another. Where is your freedom, rascal? That they do not know. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> He is being kicked out like football from this pole to that pole, and still he is thinking, "I am free."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They think reformation is a restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Reformation means restriction. Civilized means restriction. Aryan means restriction. That is civilized life. Unrestricted life means cats and dogs. Laws are meant for restriction, and they are meant for the human society, not for the cats and dogs. Why the legislative assembly is there? Why the cars are going right or left? It is meant for the civilized person, not for the cats and dogs. So civilization means restriction. A dog can have sex life on the street, but you cannot have. That is restriction because you are civilized. Civilized means restriction. The more you restrict, more you become civilized. Otherwise you remain animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say that these things are simply external.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> External, but you are animal. (laughs) You cannot understand. You see. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> "External." Why external? You violate the laws of nature; immediately you'll be punished. Why external? You infect some disease; you'll be immediately punished. Why external? It is the law of nature. You must have to follow; otherwise you'll be punished. You have got experience. If you touch fire... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you touch fire, then it must burn. Why? Can you restrict the fire? Similarly, laws of nature is so strict, as soon as you violate... Laws of nature means God's nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But by our technology we will change the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your foolishness. What you have changed? Can you stop the fire burning your hand? Can you change this? Then why you talk foolish? These are foolish propositions. Nature will act. You may be so-called advanced in science. What is, your science will do? Will you not die? Will you not be diseased? Will you not become old? Then where is your advancement? You are strictly under the laws of nature. You cannot violate a single inch even. <span class="Italic">Daiv hy eṣ guṇamay mama māy duratyayā.</span> One sane man should consider that "Why I am strictly under the laws of nature? I am prime..." This question was put by Sanātana Gosvāmī, that "I am prime minister. People adore me as <span class="Italic">paṇḍita,</span> very learned, but why I am put into these tribulations of the laws of nature? Why as prime minister and learned <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> I cannot counteract it?" This is real question. Simply doggish mentality: "Yes, why shall I not do it? Why shall I?"-what will benefit you? That means you are not even sober. You are not human being. Human being should question "Why?" That is human being. Now by nature's law the river is full with water. If the nature does not supply, what you can do, your so-called science? Can you fill up with water? Then what is your science? Bogus. You cannot counteract the laws of nature. Hm? Can you? Brahmānanda can. (laughter) He is strong enough. Kartikeya, you can do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya (Indian Life Member):</span> No, I can't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> We depend upon nature, so we can't counteract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not possible. It is all foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> We can go this small park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's a nice park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now these rascal Westerners, there the women claiming equal rights. Change that the man will give birth to a child and not the woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Equal right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equal rights. Make agreement. "Once you beget; once I shall." (laughs) Make this contract. Then it is equal right. If the woman has to give birth of a child and she has to suffer all the pains thereof, then where is the equal right? Where is equal right? Nature has said, "You must suffer." The husband, the so-called husband, will give birth, er, will utilize you for sex satisfaction, and you will be pregnant, and he will go away and you will suffer the whole life to maintain the child, welfare-"Give me some money"-or this or that. Where is equal right? He is free. He has gone away. Huh? This is general experience in the Western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "Unwed mothers."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And she cannot also check that "I shall not become mother." For sex appetite she will agree, and the man will go away and she will suffer. Is that civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Each year there are over one million abortions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In America there are over one million abortions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are advanced. They are proud of their being advanced. And they will not suffer? So we are trying to save the whole human society from rascaldom. That's all. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You see? This is <span class="Italic">nīm</span> tree. There is many <span class="Italic">nīm</span> trees. If they kindly accept and follow this movement they will be happy. Otherwise they are doomed. Let them suffer. What can I do? Thorough overhauling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Small pond they have made, fill up with water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Woman carrying a water jug.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. What the women answer about this pregnancy, that the man enjoys her and he goes away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They resent it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you accept? Why do you agree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, more and more now the women are not having sex with men anymore. They're having sex with other women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the population will stop? Will the population stop anymore? Then where is the proof? Just see how foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Sometimes they argue that only a small...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is argument. This is argument, that it is not fact. Let them... Women has agreed not to have sex with man. Then close all these maternity hospitals. That is the only happiness. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukha hi tuccham.</span> The husband and wife, they, I mean to say, mix together only for this, especially in this age. <span class="Italic">Dāmpatye ratim eva hi.</span> They get married only for sex pleasure, not for any other purpose. <span class="Italic">Dāmpatye ratim eva hi.</span> Otherwise the purpose is husband and wife together, they will worship Laksmi-Narayana and become perfect. That is the description given in <span class="Italic">Puṁsavana.</span> You will get the statement there how the husband and wife is advised to worship Nārāyaṇa, Lakṣm-Nārāyaṇa. Therefore you will find in Hindu culture, every family, Lakṣm-Nārāyaṇa worship, the husband and wife. Still there are, there is some glimpse of human civilization in India. So we can revive it. In Bhogilal's house there is no dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, no dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Otherwise, in modern civilization, such a nice house without a dog is incomplete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> He doesn't believe in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not? Yes. There must be a ferocious dog. Then it is complete. I saw in one house in Bombay, Mr. Gupta. He has kept half a dozen big, big dogs. He's a very big man in the iron market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, we sometimes meet when we... Meetings are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall go or turn?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Maybe we can go back to the park again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the European parks they do not allow to sit down on the grass. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Paris I was trying to sit down on the grass floor. Immediately some policeman, "You cannot sit here." Bench. You can sit down on the bench. So here we think we can sit down little, eh?</div>
