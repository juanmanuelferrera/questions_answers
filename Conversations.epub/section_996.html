<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the existence of God. There must be. How can you deny existence of God? It is not possible. Now, if you are convinced that there is God, then the next question will be What is that God? Is He a living being or a stone? What is the nature of God or the features of God? Whether He has... So many things we have to study about. But first of all we have to accept there is God. God, what kind of thing is that God, that is called <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> That is the beginning of philosophy. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> What is God, what is His nature, what is His feature, what does He do-these things can be inquired by human beings. A dog cannot inquire. So if a human being is not interested in these things, he's a dog. Do you agree or not? If a human being is not interested to know about God, then he's dog. This is our first charge. Now let the agnostic refute. Hmm? In human life... There are varieties of living entities, so many. The trees are also living entities, but it is standing, it has no other capacity. The birds are there, they're little improved, they're flying, they can move from one tree to another, but they have no capacity to inquire about God. There are so many insects, they are also living entity, but they do not inquire about God. It is only human being, he can inquire. That particular facility is given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> Why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> No, I mean the difference between human being and the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Why is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the first thing is that we have to accept there is God. Now, to inquire about God, this facility is given to the human being. So you must utilize it. Otherwise you are not human. Your business is, by nature's creation, your business is. The human being... Just like you dress yourself nicely, you comb your hair. That is possible by the human being. An animal may have big hair, but it cannot dress because he has no intelligence. So if you have got intelligence, if you utilize it, then life's profit is there. If you don't utilize it, then you remain lower-grade animal. So in the human form of life, the preliminary is that he can inquire about God, he can understand about God. So if he does not utilize his life for that purpose, then he is animal. So Aniruddha Prabhu requires spectacle? Or it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arundhatī:</span> No, it is just a toy glasses, toy. He does not require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You require spectacle, glass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arundhatī:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am asking him. Do you require? Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arundhatī:</span> Prabhupāda is asking if you need those glasses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes? All right. So our, this philosophy is to educate the human being to know about God. That's all. We have no other business. We're writing books on this subject matter, distributing them, educating them. We are creating preachers who can educate. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Others are denying the human rights. We are giving the human rights. We are so benevolent. Suppose your father has got some money. You are child, you do not know. But if somebody tries to hide that money or does not give you, utilizes for some other purposes; another friend is trying to give you your father's money-who is better friend, hm? Who is better friend? You cannot distinguish who is better friend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> I don't know. Yes, I can, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nandarāṇī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> The man who is giving the father's what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose you have got your father's money, you do not know. One friend is trying to hide that money, another friend is trying to give you that money. So who is better friend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> The one who is giving or trying to give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly, a human being has got the right to understand God. So one party is denying, the another party is trying to give you. So who is better friend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> The one who is giving you the knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we are the best friend of the whole world because we are trying to give him the rightful position. Others are misleading. They are enemies, they are not friend. In the name of friends, they are enemies.</div>
<div class="Verse">vāñchā-kalpatarubhyaś ca<br class="calibre2"/>kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>patitānāṁ pāvanebhyo<br class="calibre2"/>vaiṣṇavebhyo namo namaḥ</div>
<div class="Translation">[I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Therefore Vaiṣṇava is so big. One has got the right to understand God and become perfect, go back to home, back to Godhead and solve all problems. That is being denied, this rascal civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> I believe in philosophy that the Creator must exist, but I don't know about the stories and details that I hear from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you shall understand. First of all you must accept that there is creator. Then we study what is the nature of that creator. Just like these rascals, they are trying to prove that creation begins from stone, matter. Whether that is fact, whether creation begins from stone or from life, these things are to be studied. Creation they are accepting, but they are trying to prove that creation is from matter. Our proposition is "No, creation is from life." There are two things, life and matter. These are subject matters for further studies. First of all, we must know there is a creator. The atheists, they say there is no creator but there is creation, do they not? There is creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> By chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, by chance or by arrangement, but there is beginning, creation. Yes, they say "By chance." Their argument is that <span class="Italic">prakṛti-puruṣa.</span> Just like young man, young woman meets by chance, and the woman becomes pregnant. So this pregnancy is by chance. That is the argument. Is it not? There was no arrangement, but by chance they met and there is pregnancy. Is not that their argument? What is that chance argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> There is no controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no controller. By chance, they meet. There is no controller that brought them together. By chance they came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Things just combine by chance and develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no question of controller. That is their theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> By accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By accident. Accidentally they met and there is pregnancy and there is a child, production, creation. That is their idea. Or what is other argument? So far I know the atheistic, what is called that philosophy? Now I forget it. What is the philosophy of Devahūti-putra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya?</span> Atheistic <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya,</span> yes, atheistic <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya.</span> This is the atheistic <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya.</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is, <span class="Italic">kim anyat kāma-haitukam.</span> Find out this. In the Sixteenth Chapter, I think. <span class="Italic">Jagad āhur anīśvaram, kim anyat kāma-haitukam [Bg. 16.8].</span> What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram, kim anyat kāma-haitukam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te<br class="calibre2"/>jagad āhur anīśvaram<br class="calibre2"/>aparaspara-sambhūtaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kim anyat kāma-haitukam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 16.8]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their accident. Accidentally there is sex desire and something is produced. Still, they cannot say causeless. Because here it is said <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam,</span> the lusty desire was there. So therefore the lusty desire is the cause. You cannot say causeless. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Aparaspara-sambhūtam,</span> two, man and woman meets, <span class="Italic">aparaspara-sambhūtam. Para, apara.</span> But <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam.</span> So you cannot say causeless. Then you have to search out wherefrom this lusty desire came. That is <span class="Italic">kāraṇa.</span> Find out one cause after another, another, another. Then you'll find <span class="Italic">sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you go on searching out, you have to find out this cause. Because you are saying <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam,</span> the lusty desire is the cause, nothing else. But if you are a philosopher, then you must find out wherefrom the lusty desire comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It comes from a certain combination of material ingredients.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but that means cause after cause you have to find how the combination came. That is called philosophy. Go on searching out, searching out. Then you'll find <span class="Italic">sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> We say that <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam,</span> that desire is there in Kṛṣṇa. And therefore, you are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, that desire has come to you. We see Kṛṣṇa's dealing with <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> with Rādhārāṇī, exactly like young man, young woman. The <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam</span> is there. It is not fictitious. It has come down, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1]. Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> Kṛṣṇa says... The <span class="Italic">kāma</span> also, you have to accept it, because Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> "Whatever you have got, that is from Me." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot say the <span class="Italic">kāma</span> is independent. That's not fact. It is coming from Kṛṣṇa. [break] <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya, sarvasya,</span> you'll have take <span class="Italic">kāma</span> also, everything, everything is coming. As Kṛṣṇa says everything, <span class="Italic">kāma</span> is also coming from Him. In another place Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> It cannot be independent. The <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam,</span> the man and woman, lusty desire, that is also coming from Kṛṣṇa. You cannot finish the subject matter simply <span class="Italic">kāma-haitukam.</span> Wherefrom this <span class="Italic">kāma</span> came? Kṛṣṇa answers that. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is situated in both the boy's and the girl's heart. So Kṛṣṇa is giving, "You wanted to enjoy, now here is opportunity, you take it." Then Kṛṣṇa becomes cause. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam.</span> "You wanted, you have got, here is. You wanted a young boy-here is." <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtiḥ.</span> Therefore He's <span class="Italic">sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So even if you say <span class="Italic">kim anyat kāma-haitukam,</span> still you have to accept God. There is no escape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say the material universe is causeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material universe is caused by, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say that it is causeless, there's nothing beyond it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how it can be? Material... Suppose matter. Now this wood is dead matter. Wherefrom it has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not "well," first of all, study this. Wherefrom this wood has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From a tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And wherefrom the tree has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So the material elements are already there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bīja, bīja. Bījāhaṁ sarva-bhūtānām.</span> You sow the seed, there will come out a tree, and from that tree there will be big trunk and you cut the tree, then you get wood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's all right, that's agreed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is real, that is intelligence, that wherefrom the tree has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But this has been going on eternally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But the material elements are there, and they just evolve into different shapes and forms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but the original creation is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, no, it has eternally been going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eternally is going on, but the process is here. Eternally this man is born, that does not mean you were not born by your father. You deny your father, eternally born. You must have particular knowledge. Don't talk like that. Eternally, eternally father gives birth, that's a fact. But there must be father. Eternally father is giving birth to a child, that's a fact. Eternally birth is going on, that does not mean denying the father. The father is the cause. Anything law, that is going on eternally, there is no question of... Nature's law is going on eternally. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if the material elements are there and they're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are talking of the process. Things are going on eternally, there is no doubt about it. The process is also eternal, but we have to study the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But that's their argument, that the process is just happening by itself, there's no father. They say the process is that the elements are just there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is no father. And he has no father, the rascal who is talking? He has no father? Immediately beat him with shoes. (laughter) The rascal, you are talking, you have got your father. Beat him with shoes immediately on his mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They say for a plant, ground is necessary, water is necessary, seed is necessary, air is necessary, so why is it that there is only one cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the one everything is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Why isn't it coming from several sources? Instead of one source, why not several sources?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, he has no intelligence. Just like government has so many departments. But original is the king. The departments are only facilities for functioning. But the origin is the king, government. Because there are different departments, there is no king. This is rascaldom. They are rascals, simply rascals. There is no solid argument against.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> When they say there is no God, sometimes we say, "How do you know?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we say that there is a creator, and that is God. By experience we see that there is a creator, and God means the supreme creator. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> What do you think about the human being's science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, science is correct, as far as it is practical. Science means practical. And, so far I know, those who are students of science, they have to appear for practical examination, is it not? Simply theoretical knowledge is not science. So much percentage of oxygen, so much percentage of hydrogen, mix together, becomes water. That you have to demonstrate in the laboratory, create water by mixing of oxygen, like that. That is science. But if you simply theorize, and when I say that you now practically prove, you say "Wait millions of years," that is nonsense; that is not science. That is nonsense. The observation and experiment. Simply observing is not science. And observing, this chemical, this chemical is being combined, then it can be... First of all, observation. But when you put into, what is called, experiment, and practically show, then it is... They say that life is generated by combination of chemicals. So now show me by experiment, then it is science. Otherwise it is nonsense. The things are going on like this. They are suggesting that life is combination of chemical, but when you ask them to show it by experiment, "Wait for millions of years." This is not science, this is rascaldom. It is just like postdated check. If I give you check for three hundred years dated back, will you accept? Million dollars, but the date is twenty-three, not nineteen hundred, twenty hundred, but twenty-three hundred. Will you accept that check? I can say, "By that time I'll get this money and deposit the bank. You take the check." Will you accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's better to take that check than no check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A foolish rascal will accept. (laughter) You are rascal number one. You can accept that check, we are not going to. He's proved that you are rascal number one. It is better to have a check. It is better to have a post-check. Just see, these rascals are there. They prefer to be cheated. This is the, going on. Therefore these rascals get drunk. Because there are so many poor drunkards there, they will accept this check and they go on cheating, postdated check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> The scientists are saying, "We are going to find out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That is postdated check, that I am explaining. Why don't you understand it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> But the religionists, they say "We don't know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we do not say about religion. We are talking of science. It will take three millions of years to understand religion for these rascals. They are now animals. Religion is not so easy thing to be understood by the cats and dogs. Religion is meant for the human being. In the human society there is religion, not in the dog society or the cats and dogs. They do not understand religion means they are cats and dogs, they are not human beings. Human being is that: <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>,</span> to inquire about the nature of God. That is human being. Otherwise cats and dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> So why we are so involved in the material world that most of the human being don't have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are being misled by misleaders, that is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> Yes, but why, God, why they don't see, we don't see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They see they are suffering, but they have no eyes to see. They are being slapped both ways and kicked with shoes, but they have no eyes to see. Going on. So much trouble, so many problems, that you cannot drive even on the street. We wanted to see some house; because the street is so congested, we had to wait three days. And still I am thinking that I am making progress. This is rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad:</span> Yes, that's right, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not yes. First of all understand your rascaldom. You have created such a situation that to go to a place two miles away from my place, I have to wait for three days. And we are taking it as progress. This is rascaldom. But what is inconvenient, we are taking it as progress. To go to a place two miles away, it takes ten minutes or, say, twenty minutes. Now we have to wait two days. And we are taking it as progress. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> means what is not. It is not progress, but we are taking as progress. Degrees we are taking as progress. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Hm? What do you say, Nandarāṇī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> I think her question is, is this God's plan or our plan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not God's plan, it is your plan. Whatever you make, it will cause inconvenience. And if you follow God's plan, you'll make progress. Where is in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said by Kṛṣṇa that you make motorcars like this? He has never said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They get a bit confused because God has to... Like that man last night was saying not even a blade of grass can move without God's sanction. So they think because God sanctions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is so many times explained. Just like a child wants to do something. The father says, "Don't do it," I have said several times. Reluctantly, "All right, do it." I have given this example of my practical experience in 1925 or '26 when my son was two years old. There was a table fan, "I would like to touch it." And I said, "No, no, don't touch." This is child. So but it's a child. He again tried to touch it. So there was a friend, he said, "Just slow the speed and let him touch." So I did it, slowed the speed and he touched-<span class="Italic">tung!</span> Then he would not touch. You see. So this sanction was given, "Touch it," reluctantly. Now when he gets experience and I ask him, "Touch again?" "No." So this sanction. All of us who have come to this material world, it is like that. Reluctantly. Therefore God comes again to inform these rascals that "Now you have tried so much, better give up this, come to Me again." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Sanction was given, certainly, and he has experience, very bitter, but still he won't... This is obstinacy. Dog's mentality. The father has come personally. Now we have experimented everything-<span class="Italic">karma, jñāna, yoga,</span> this, that, all nonsense. "Now I say..." It is said most confidential. <span class="Italic">Sarva-guhyatamam.</span> "Better give up this job. Surrender to Me, come back to Me." So sanction was there, certainly. Without sanction they cannot do it. God created this. That is sanction. You wanted material world to enjoy. "All right, do it, here is material world. Take as much petrol as you like and drive motorcar and create accident, do, go on. But now I am giving you good advice, that give up this business, come back to Me." This is sanction. Reluctant, the same example. I did not like that child to touch the fan, but he would insist. "All right, make an experiment." And when he got the experience, next time, ask him, "Now do it?" "No." This is going on. The sanction, without sanction there is no possibility. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanam</span>-that is <span class="Italic">mattaḥ,</span> "from Me." But he's insisting, so therefore sanction-"All right, let him experiment." That independence God never touches. So he has got independence. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">.</span> So he is creating problem. Still, Kṛṣṇa coming, that "You have created simply problems. What you have gained? Better give up this all nonsense, come to Me." This is the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Those who are intelligent, they are taking up. And those who are still remaining rascal, they are going on. That is our choice, if we want to be intelligent or rascal. Practically. What we have gained by this so-called material advancement? They have created problem, different problems. That's all. But still, we think that it is progress. And this is going on. Without God's sanction you cannot do anything, that's a fact. But what kind of sanction it is, that you have to understand. God is creator, God is giving sanction, everything is God. Otherwise how He is God? But He has to do. There is a story like that, that the thief is praying to God, "My Lord, give me the chance I can make some stealing in that house." And the householder also praying to God, "My Lord, please save my house, my things may not be stolen." Now God has to adjust, God has to please the thief and the householder. And both of them are prayers. So God has so intelligence, He can do that. He can give the sanction to the thief and He can give protection to the householder. That is God's position. Because both of them prayers, praying, "Give me the facility." And <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> And He is situated in everyone's heart and there are so many petitions, and He has to deal with them. That is God. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But sometimes things happen people don't want to happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their business. They want or they don't want, that's all. Two business. Because their mind is not fixed up, they have got two businesses-"don't do it," "do it." That's all. There is no third business. Two things-"do it," "don't do it." That's all. Sometimes accepting-"Do it"-and again rejecting, "No, no, don't do it." This is material world. "Do it" and "don't do it." And things are becoming implicated. <span class="Italic">Saṅkalpa-vikalpa.</span> So he has to fix up his mind. "I have done so much 'don't do it' and 'do it.' Now I shall decide to do only what Kṛṣṇa says." Then his life is perfect. "I shall give up this business, 'don't do it' and 'do it.' But I'll simply do what Kṛṣṇa says." <span class="Italic">Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Yes, now I'll do it. What You say, I'll do it." Then his life is perfect. Otherwise he'll continue, "don't do it," "do it," "don't do it," "do it," that's all. And Kṛṣṇa will give him sanction-"do it" and "don't do it." Unless he comes to the original consciousness, Kṛṣṇa has to give him sanction, "Yes, do it." "Yes, do not do it." What can be done? But He says, "Give up this business, 'don't do it' and 'do it.' Simply do what I say. Then you'll be happy." Unless we agree to that point, we have to continue this material life, life after life, and suffer. Material body means suffering. Either you get human body or animal body or tree body or any body, suffers.</div>
<div class="Verse">na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam<br class="calibre2"/>asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto<br class="calibre2"/>yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So long one does not inquire about his spiritual position, he'll have to accept this material body and suffer. This is the law of nature. So therefore our business is how to stop accepting this material body. That is the, our... <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted. How to stop accepting this material body. So that is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Karma, jñāna, yoga,</span> you'll have to accept material body. Maybe better body you may have. But better or bad, worse, whatever body you accept, you have to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> This <span class="Italic">saṅkalpa-vikalpa</span> is there as long as we have our independence, though. Even as devotees, that accepting and rejecting? That is there even in devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A devotee, because a nondevotee has become a devotee, he is practicing how to simply accept Kṛṣṇa's orders. But by his previous habit he's still engaged in "do it" and "don't do it." That is his previous habit. Just like this fan is running. You take out the switch, the current is stopped, but it's still running, at least three, four rounds. So similarly, if you have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, your, that current of "do it" or "do not," is stopped. Because you have agreed to do only what Kṛṣṇa says. If you have actually decided like that, then you are free. There is no more current of "do it" or "not do it." But because you were habituated in your past life to this "do it" or "not do it," sometimes it is found. But that is... Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">api cet sudurācāro<br class="calibre2"/>bhajate mām ananya-bhāk<br class="calibre2"/>sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>samyag vyavasito hi saḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.30]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He has got little practice of these nonsense things. But if he sticks to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this will be stopped very soon. That is the only remedy. So a devotee means he has taken vow before the spiritual master, before the fire, before... If he sticks to his principle, then he's free. Even though some bad habits found due to his past behavior. That will be stopped. But he must stick. <span class="Italic">Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span> That must stick. Kṛṣṇa consciousness must continue. Everything will be corrected. And if there is slackness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then again he'll fall down. That I was telling this morning, that if you have determination, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will put forward so many impediments, and with all sufferings, if he remains determined in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then life is success. A man is habituated to smoke. He has given up, has promised no more smoking. Just like our students. Now he's put amongst some friends, they are smoking. But he has bad habit, he's thinking, "Why not smoke?" And if the friends offer, "It is friends. Who is going to see, your spiritual master." "Yes." That is possible. But if he comes to his sense again, "Oh, what I have done?" If he repents, "I promised it before my spiritual master, before God, before fire. Now I'm doing this?" that repentance will help him. And if he thinks that "I'm doing it. My spiritual master is not here, let me fall to it," then he is finished. Then he is finished. If he repents for the wrong he has done, then he's excused. Otherwise finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is there any limit to the number of chances that he has?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is limit. Once, twice, thrice. If you make four times, then it is extricated: "Get out rascal, cheating."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> But Śrīla Prabhupāda, aren't there fallen sinful people who are still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Amongst fallen, sinful people, if you want to remain fallen, sinful, then who can help you? It is up to you. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> And if you want to remain fallen, "No, I'll do it, go on," you remain. What is objection of Kṛṣṇa? Go on. You are suffering, go on suffering. I give you this suggestion, you do it. If you do it, you become free. But if you want to continue, continue, it is your business. Go on suffering. Why you make Kṛṣṇa responsible? You are responsible for your own activities.</div>

But if you want to stop it, if you are conscious of the material position, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">,</span> then you have to stop it.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> That deliberation means to study your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone has got deliberating power. If you go to purchase one two-cents'-worth lozenges, still you see three qualities are there.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have got your intelligence. God has given you intelligence. Now you deliberate. But if you... A devotee, without using my intelligence, I surrender. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Immediately you become the greatest <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> If you simply believe in Kṛṣṇa, "What my nonsense intelligence...?

And if you think still that "I am more intelligent (than) Kṛṣṇa, let me deliberate and consider," then you remain rascal. You cannot be more intelligent than Kṛṣṇa. He says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> you take it. That is real intelligence. That is real intelligence. Just like obedient son, my father says to do it. "All right, I shall take it, although it does not appeal to me." That is good son. Natural guardian, father, if son understands "My father or mother, whatever they will say, it is surely for my good. They cannot be cheater." So intelligent son will take "Yes, my father says, I'll do it. That's all. Never mind it does not appeal to me." That is intelligence, real intelligence. "Because I am immature, my father knows my good, he says 'My dear son, do it. It will be nice.' I'll do it." That's all. Without any objection. That is intelligence. That is real intelligence. But the father gives the freedom, "Now you deliberate." But it is my duty, when father says, what is deliberation? I'll accept. That is intelligence. And if you do not do it, then you come to that <span class="Italic">karma, na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> God offers, but the rascal, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ, narādhamāḥ,</span> will not do it. They'll suffer. Go on, continue to suffer. He'll not do it, all right, go on, suffer. Next life if he becomes dog, the ear is there, but he'll not be able to hear what Kṛṣṇa says: finished. That chance is finished. This is going on. The dog has ear, big ear, bigger than me. But he cannot hear what is Kṛṣṇa saying. That is not possible. But this life I've got this ear, I can hear. If I don't take chance, then how much foolish I am. Next life, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> I'll get next life, next birth. Now it is not necessarily that I'll get the next life also same ear. No. The ear may be different. The eyes may be different. The eyes are there, ears are there, nose is, but it is different. So long we have got these eyes, these ears, this nose, utilize it properly. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya, kṛṣṇa guru nāhi mile bhaja...(?)</span> Every birth you'll get a father, mother. Because without father, mother, there is no question of birth. But not in every birth you'll get Kṛṣṇa and guru. That is in this birth. Birth you can have. But to have Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">guru,</span> that is this birth. So utilize it properly. <span class="Italic">Janame janame saba pitā mātā pāya, kṛṣṇa guru nāhi mile bhaja...</span> Very nice. That chance you'll not get. You'll get body, you'll get eyes, you'll get ear, you'll get father, you'll get mother, you'll get food, you'll get sex, you'll get defense, everything you'll get. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara.</span> But not this chance, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa guru nāhi mile bhaja.</span> You'll not get Kṛṣṇa and guru. This is the difference. How nice verse it is. Everything you'll get, but you'll not get this. How nice it is. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> another body you'll get. Another body you'll get means you will get all bodily facilities. There is no scarcity between this body and that body. But only scarcity is that in other body you'll not get Kṛṣṇa and guru. We have to remember this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> that once in every structure of the universe, every living entity gets the opportunity to have guru and Kṛṣṇa and very, very nice situation. He gets that opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am speaking, that this is the only chance of Kṛṣṇa, guru, and if he neglects this chance, then <span class="Italic">tanwan sthito hi ga</span>(?). What is the loss more than that? We are simply calculating loss and gain. Just imagine what is the loss by misusing this human form of body. If you want to spoil this life under the influence of misleaders, you can do it. But if you prefer to take the sense of following leadership of Kṛṣṇa, then our life... <span class="Italic">Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> That comes <span class="Italic">mām ekam, ekam-</span>then your life is successful. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "I'll give you protection in all respects."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You were saying that by intelligence one can just accept what the father says will be good for him and he'll do it, but most people have such a bad experience in the material world, they get cheated so often...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his misfortune, if the father is cheating him. So that means he's most unfortunate. Father is not expected to cheat the son, but if he's cheated by the father, then he must accept himself as most unfortunate cheated in the world. Then there is no help. Because he's so unfortunate that he's under the care of a cheater father, then what can be done? Nobody expects that father will cheat. And nowadays it is coming. Mother is cheating, mother is killing, father is cheated. Yes. It is Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it seems as though in the modern scientific idea, so-called scientific idea, is that everyone should have his own individual intelligence, develop himself.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whatever you like, you can do. Kṛṣṇa says that you have got intelligence. "You consider, I have spoken to you. Now you use your intelligence and do whatever you like." Kṛṣṇa does not deny your intelligence. There is no meaning. You have got your intelligence. That is your... Training, you take Kṛṣṇa's training. If you don't take, then you remain in your own training. Kṛṣṇa is training you, He says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> but if you don't take His training, then you remain in your own training. Who objects? Remain a rascal. Who objects? Continue to become a rascal. What can be done? That <span class="Italic">yathecchasi tathā kuru</span> is already said. You use your intelligence. If you prefer to remain rascal, you remain. Kṛṣṇa does not say that "Don't use your intelligence." What does He say? But if you are actually intelligent, then you'll think that, "Who can be more intelligent than Kṛṣṇa? Let me take His advice." That is real intelligence. Why shall I use my tiny intelligence? That is real intelligence.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think you are from the south?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He wants to know if you are from the south.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not from south, I am from Calcutta. West, west of India, no? Calcutta is east.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They say everything good comes from Bengal. The best poets, the best gurus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not always. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Ramakrishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays Naxalites are coming. It is the time, Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, I'm from far south.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> His father was attached to British in India. He traveled in India during his boyhood in South India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In my young age I had one Afghani friend, he belonged to the royal family. What is the king? Some of their brothers were banished in India. Who was the king? So one..., the family were staying in Allahabad. His name was Sen, Sen Aband(?) like that. So he was my friend. He was coming to me and we were talking. Amar Lakhana(?), his brother, he belonged to the royal family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right, that must be before 1936 though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am talking between 1925-30. So this same friend was coming to me and we were talking. I think at that time Afghanistan was under British influence? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, we had only one war. That was about sixty, seventy years ago, and they entered and they captured Kabul, but the whole brigade was stopped. This was the time Churchill was the only one who escaped troops, and that was the end of it. They never... It was too risky for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Afghanistan, when they were Hindus, this Kandahar, the King of Kandahar, his daughter was married to the Pāṇḍavas. Gāndhārī. Gāndhārī(?)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gāndhārī was the daughter of Kandahar king. Kandahar is still there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, well, there are quite a number of Hindus in Kandahar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are Hindus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Oh, yes. Most of the business shops are controlled by Hindus. Also in the school, as well, there are lots of teachers, and education is managed by Hindus. But they are for years... [break] ...for hundreds and hundreds of years. You make this tour around the world once a year or twice a year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I've gone round the world fifteen times within ten years. Naturally more than once in a year. And we have got branches all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think the temples are increasing, particularly in Germany, England, and I suppose in America as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in America we have got forty branches. Our philosophy is simple. We educate people to understand that there is God. This is a godless civilization. So we say that there is God. Try to understand, and love Him, that's all. This is our philosophy. Then you'll be happy. And so long you do not love God, you simply love dog, you'll never be happy. That is our philosophy. You have diverted your loving spirit to the dog. You change it. Instead of loving dog, you love God. Then dog will be loved and everyone will be loved. If you simply love dog, then your love will be simply in dog. But if you love God, then you'll love God and dog also. Just like you are eating. So the eatable is going to the stomach. If you distribute this eatable to the eyes, to the ears, to the nose-there are nine holes-it will be uselessly spoiled. And if you give this foodstuff to the stomach, the energy will be immediately distributed to the ears, to the eyes, to the nose, to the... Similarly, if you have got a propensity to love, you love God, your love will be distributed everywhere. And if you fix your love to the dog, then it is uselessly spoiled. That is going on. They have manufactured love for country, for this, that, so many things. But without love of God. Therefore the disturbance is going on. However big nationalist you may be, you cannot make happy anyone. That is not possible. Take for example our Mahatma Gandhi. He's recognized nationally, but he was killed by his countrymen. That's a fact. That means he could not make happy anyone. So we have got some loving propensity. If we love... That is our natural position. If we love God, then our love for others will automatically be done. And on account of loving God, our life will be perfect. What do you think of this philosophy? What do you think of this philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think it's the supreme philosophy. It is basic philosophy which has been spoken, and unfortunately no practice, but it's a very good thought. It's a very big part and inject it again and revive it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Love God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Premā pumartho mahān.</span> Love of God is the highest perfection of life. This is our philosophy. (end)</div>
