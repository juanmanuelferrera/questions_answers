<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...the brain of Einstein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Brain of who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Einstein?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Einstein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Well, the way they're doing it is through the genetic, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Whatever it may be, they are trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...to make a xerox copy. So why not the original?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Explain to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Why not the original?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. The scientists, they are trying to make a xerox copy of Professor Einstein. So why not the original? Hm? What is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>They cannot keep the original alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, that's all right, but let them make one original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>They can't even begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>They can't even make a cell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then what is their credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>They have made a computer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>They have made a computer, but it takes a human being to program the computer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So what is their credit? If you simply copy something, that is not credit. The credit should go to the original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>The scientists admit that there is nothing new that they can make. Everything is the manipulation of the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then the thing is that as they are individual person trying to do something wonderful, the individual person who has already done all this wonderful, how much credit He deserves. If by simply copying you want to take so much credit that you will defy the existence of God, you are so fool, rascal, then how much credit should be given to the original person who has made all these things existing. What is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>They simply don't care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Like that man said last night, "We <i class="calibre3">will</i> do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You will do, that's all right, you will do it, but it is already there. What is your credit, you will do it? It is already there, then what is your credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>They choose to ignore it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Even if you do that, the already one who has done it, why don't you give Him credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Yeah, instead of being envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b><i class="calibre3"> Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]<i class="calibre3">,</i> they are envious, rascal. Envious means rascal. That is material quality. And spiritual quality means to praise good quality. "Oh, you are so nice, you have got so good quality." That is spiritual. And enviousness, "Oh, this man is surpassing me. All right, I..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Cut him down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's right. This is material. <i class="calibre3">Matsaratā. </i>This is explained in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> as <i class="calibre3">matsaratā. Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstavaḥ vastu vedyam atra<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.1.2]<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Last night you said that that man's claim was like a poor man saying, "Yes, I'll become a millionaire."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>"Someday I'll become a millionaire."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And he wants the respect of a millionaire immediately, with future tense. Just see. "You give me the respect of a millionaire. I shall become in future a millionaire." What is this nonsense? First of all you become millionaire, then ask the respect. They want the credit beforehand. Trust no future, however pleasant. Why shall I believe you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>There's a lake over there. There's a pond, we can walk down there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, bridge we are not going to cross? All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Every time they find something new they should be glorifying Krsna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is Krsna consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> (aside) What's in there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Peaches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>It's all there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>These are all peach trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh. You have made this nice park, but with the help of God, who has created all these trees. You cannot do that. This means that you try to help or cooperate with God, then your credit is all right. Just like God has created this tree, and you are cooperating to make it nicely trimmed, make this path, this is cooperation. You take this much credit. But the first credit given to God, who has created this tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Does this remind you of Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Is this like Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Vṛndāvana is different. This is man-made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Is this like Dvārakā, when Krsna was living in Dvārakā, they had...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, Dvārakā, yes. Vṛndāvana trees are all full of fruits and flowers. These are for fuel, these trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>For fuel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all. For burning. There is no fruits and flowers. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>...come on shore and get drunk and make trouble. They have their own police.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Military has their own police.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They are so pious and advanced in civilization, the students require police. The dean has publicly requested police, and still they are very much proud of advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>The police steals too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Especially in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And police also requires another police. <i class="calibre3">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā</i> [SB 5.18.12].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>All these Indians coming to this country to benefit, maybe we should go to India to take care of Vṛndāvana and all these other lands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Therefore, this movement is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Will we be someday in charge of those?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh yes, we are already in charge. You simply take charge. Your appointment is already there; simply go and take charge over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>No one else can even dispute it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. (end)</div>
