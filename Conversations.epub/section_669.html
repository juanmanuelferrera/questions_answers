<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you make "Hindu religion," "Muslim religion," "Christian religion," immediately it is not religion, immediately. Because Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why does He say, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya?</span> (Aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Because that is not religion. The so-called religions which are going on, they are not religion. That we do not say at the present moment because you are not so strong. But we have to say that. There is no religion. All cheating. Why Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">?</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because there is no other religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That is actual religion, surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. Everything else is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Cheating others, cheating himself. Just like this animal sacrifice. The man who is sacrificing, he is cheating himself, and he is cheating others also. [break] ...cheating, envious. Just like a man who is killing another man. So he is envious to himself as well as the man whom he is killing. Both. I am killing somebody, he is being killed. I am envious. And I forget that I'll be killed. Then I am envious to me also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah. Even one's own self-interest he is not taking care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the position. Even it is forbidden... In the Christian religion it is forbidden: "Thou shall not kill." And they are killing. That means envious of the animal, and he is envious of himself also. They are now being killed in the womb of the mother. Why the child is now being killed within the womb of the mother? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because they are envious. They are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Upendra has not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He said he had to take a laxative last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some way or other, he avoids. Eh? [break] ...therefore forbidden to make one steady in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if one does not follow this thing, then his mind, he cannot control. It is not possible. Unless one can control the mind and the senses, he cannot be steady. That is <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> trick, to become guided by the mind. That is <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> trick. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> ...sixteen rounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So let him go to hell. What can be done? [break] So his friend said, "Oh, you are drinking. You will go to hell." "Oh, my father is drinking." "Oh, he will go to hell." "My mother is also drinking." "Oh, she will go." Then brother, sister... "Then where is hell? We are going all there. If we can live together, where is hell? Let us go to hell. Doesn't matter." So your argument is that. "Because everyone is being cheated, then where is fault? I have been cheated. That's all. It is not hell. It is heaven." (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It's like saying everything is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That cannot be. You are one cheated and he is one cheater. How they can be one? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> [break] ...isn't self-sufficiency...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Self-suff... There is no self-sufficiency. Self-insufficiency. Always remember that. Unless you become perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no self-sufficiency. All self-insufficiency. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] So you give me a description, what he is doing. [break] ...thinking, "I am independent," but he is kicked by his mind every moment. This is his independence-"Go there. Come here. Do this. Do that." The mind is dictating, and he is thinking, "I am independent." This is the position of conditioned soul. Therefore he is called conditioned. He is conditioned by the mind, and he is thinking "independent." <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Tri-guṇamayair bhāvaiḥ mohitaḥ.</span> He is illusioned by the three modes of material nature, and he does not know Kṛṣṇa, and he is thinking "independent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> The mind is cheating us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly he'll cheat. If you cannot control, it will cheat. Mind is the friend, and mind is the enemy. If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious fully, then mind is friend. And if you do not become Kṛṣṇa conscious, mind is enemy. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is also. If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then she is Rādhārāṇī. And if he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, she is Durga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So all these cheaters are <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> agents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they are agent of Kṛṣṇa. (to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> But because you want to cheat Kṛṣṇa, therefore they are cheating you. They are not your servant. <span class="Italic">Mama māyā:</span> "My servant." Just like the police. Police is punishing you not on their own account. Because you are disobedient, you must be punished. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The moment we stop cheating Kṛṣṇa, then we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, immediately, he becomes friend. This is the way, going on. The whole arrangement is like that. So long we shall not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, we have to suffer so many ways, different species of life, different condition, different planets. This is going on. [break] ...indirectly forcing that "You be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise you'll be punished." Why police is so unkind? Because the indirect way is that "You become lawful; otherwise you'll continue to be suffering by us." So intelligent person thinks of it, and he becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious. And those who are rascals, fools, bewildered, they think, "We shall adjust it by manufacturing every year new type of motorcars." Although there is accident... The increase of motorcar means increasing the death rate of public. Huh? And still they'll do that. It is becoming problem in cities in Europe and America. All roads and streets are always congested. They cannot drive even at ten miles speed. Still, they are increasing. Still, they are increasing motorcar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are passing laws now that you're not allowed to drive your car in the center of the cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. They are keeping two miles away the car and coming to the office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They make them come by trains and buses. Even though they have a car, they cannot use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> And they pack all the cars on top of the roofs of the buildings, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> They're using all the roofs of the buildings as car parks to park the cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And they are very much proud of making so many cars. Just like we were in Detroit. Remember, you were there. They had a big sign, "Seven million cars produced this year."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah. They have a board with numbers, and each time a car is produced, it is put on the board. And it's a big board displayed in the city. (end)</div>
