<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...one hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just after it gets dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just after sun does down it gets a little dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then at what time it should be happened? You can inquire from other temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Last winter we had, 6:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> With the season it changes little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is there any regulation given in the <span class="Italic">pañjikā,</span> when?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just... Only regulation given for timing is that for Deity going to rest at noon. The Deity should take rest at noon, two <span class="Italic">yāmas</span> after sunrise, and take rest in evening, one <span class="Italic">yāma</span> after sunset. But it didn't say anything about the other āratis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> it is called <span class="Italic">sandhya ārati. Sandhya ārati</span> means just in the evening. So when evening time is there... After sunset it is not evening. What is the time of sunset nowadays? Bring <span class="Italic">pañjikā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Around 5:30, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the time of sunset?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's about 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 5:30, then one hour after. Then 6:30 is all right. 6:30 is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Okay. So in that case, when would you like to come and visit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, 6:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Now you're coming six till seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> 5:30 to 6:30?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall come... 6:30-7:00, <span class="Italic">ārati</span> will go on. So we can come half an hour before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 5:30. 5:30. Instead of coming there at six, I come there 5:30. And one hour, then 6:30 begins. Make that like that. That will be nice. So why you were not present in the meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I was there, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> That's all right. I think you can understand Hindi? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I am trying to. I can understand little bit. I am practicing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should learn Hindi, Bengali. You are learning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He talks... When he talks, he talks a little fast, when he reads the <span class="Italic">anuvada.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Ah, Prema-yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, he is... But I am studying. He is translating nice. He is learned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We wanted to ask you about... He was training up Prema-yogi to do the editing, but there's no one to do the transcribing. We'll have to send the tapes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transcribing? No, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Why can't Pālikā do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She can do it? I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pālikā can do it? That will be all right, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You also learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Typing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In case there is none, you should do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Pālikā's done it before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Pālikā can do. I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> She is expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is expert in typing. Amongst the women, she is expert typist. She is expert in so many things. Only defect is that she is woman. But Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśyaḥ:</span> "Never mind woman. If she is devotee, she also comes to Me." <span class="Italic">Striyaḥ śūdrās tathā,</span> "no one barred." Especially naming, <span class="Italic">striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśya te 'pi yānti parām.</span> Everyone is to be.... Kṛṣṇa is so kind. There is no restriction. Everyone is open to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya-nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is open to all living entities. There is no restriction. And so long this body is there, material, there is distinction between this and that. Otherwise, when you come to the platform of spiritual understanding, <span class="Italic">paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">,</span> then there is no restriction. Higher, lower, this, that, so many. <span class="Italic">Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80]<span class="Italic">.</span> So any newspaper propaganda against us? No. One complaint is standing, that with our life members and others, subscriber, they always complain they are not getting paper, they are not getting book. That is the general complaint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> They send regularly. We are sending. But many times the mail is stolen, magazines, <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Yes, it is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because there are so many nice picture. I have seen. When I was printing my books in a Delhi press, so one peon was coming there to work part time as compositor. So his mailbag he will put somewhere in the press and he will being composing. And all other compositors, they'll check the mail bag and if something is attractive, they will take. I have seen it. Our magazine is so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> It's so beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...full of pictures, so naturally, as soon as they, the picture and..., they take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Yes, that's the trouble. So we have a system in some towns. We find one member who is very much liking us, and we send all the magazines to him, and he goes, sends his, given by hand, to all the other members in that city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> We are doing that in some cities but we don't have in all cities such a system. That system works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is possible? Some are living ten miles from him. It is not possible. No, that is happening in India, not in other countries. In your country the peons are very responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Yes, the post office is also very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here they never satisfied. This is the modern mentality. Nobody is satisfied with his income. He wants more money. And for that purpose he can do anything rascal. I have seen it. This peon puts his bag without any responsibility. Letters are strewn and maybe some letters stolen. Who can say? And he came to earn some money. For some time he'll compose and get some labor. And in Calcutta I have seen all the office peons, they are sleeping in Dalhousie Square, the peon book as the pillow, for hours together. And when they, after distributing, when they return to the office it is going to be closed. And if they are asked explanation, "Why you are so late?" "Oh, he was not there. I had to wait three hours," and so on, so on, so on. Everyone is dishonest. Nobody is working honestly. Especially in India, because poverty-stricken. If they can sleep two hours he thinks that he has made some profit. Formerly people were God conscious. They did not like to cheat, that "God will be displeased." Now they don't believe in God, so they can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Now that we've become devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Everyone is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> If we sleep for two hours we think we have wasted two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be. Sleeping is waste of time. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**, we have to conquer over eating and sleeping and mating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just the opposite to the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> They want to increase their eating. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly, when I was in Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, there was a <span class="Italic">khol</span> manufacturer here. Is he here still? He supplied me <span class="Italic">khol</span> very nice, very big. This <span class="Italic">khol</span> was taken to Germany or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> What was his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I forgot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> There is one man here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> One man is here, but I don't know if it's the same one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you call him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Yes. I think he's just a repairman though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever he may be. Yes. We must have very good <span class="Italic">khol.</span> You have no good <span class="Italic">khol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> I had one under repair. I had two under repair with him. But he takes a long time. I am waiting now for repair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can call him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Okay. You'd like to meet him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If the same man, then I can ask him to prepare some khol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Ours get damaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The shells or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> They break them so easily. They cannot control them. The shell, the skin, anything, always break.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You should make some padded covers for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is doing that? Everyone is irresponsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Even with that, they break.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But at least it helps the chances they'll survive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The one thing is that they neglect that rings. That ring and the strap, if it is... That will never do. As soon as they <span class="Italic">khol,</span> some rope, <span class="Italic">bas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Usually what breaks is that little leather loop, you know, the small loop on each end. That's what usually breaks. If you want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you make it nicely with chain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> I have made it even nicely with a cord, with a ring, and the proper straps. But they put it like this and like this and they bang it the wrong way. This is my problem. I can't stop it, no matter what we do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You just bring them out for <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and then have somebody take them back and they won't get broken. Haṁsadūta was doing that with his <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> I was also doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas</span> are in there all day long. Any <span class="Italic">karmī</span> that comes in, they beat the drum and mess around. The little kids go in and they do the same thing. I've seen them. You should take them out of the temple. Let them be there for <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and then take them away and store them in your room. There's no <span class="Italic">kartālas</span> now either because everybody steals them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These two rooms can be used for keeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kartālas</span> are locked away every time and the drums were done... That was done until they were broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Or you can just put them in that tourist room. Or in the <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Yeah, I'll arrange for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything depends on organized management. Give some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> Shall I put... Some gentlemen, some <span class="Italic">bābājīs,</span> are coming now, some <span class="Italic">metas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiye, aiye. Betiye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akśayananda:</span> May I help <span class="Italic">bota?</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Betiye.</span> (end)</div>
