<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have nothing to eat all the time. Ninety percent of the peasantry absolutely, completely wiped out during the Britishers' time. They never looked after them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Poverty is the cause of nonretirement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have nothing to eat. They hardly get, I mean, two meals. Not square but even triangle. (laughs) They don't get any food in the mofices(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the question of mofices?(?) I am talking of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> India is made up of all villages and mofices(?). Cities are few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is the cause of nonretirement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean to my mind. It may be another cause also. I don't know. What do you think? Lack of proper education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Big, big men like Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi, they never retired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gandhi, as a matter of fact, retired long back. I mean the... As far as I know, he was not a member of the Congress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. It was everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is... You are. You may not be member, but you are everything. They like that. I mean, if I am not wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by retire? Retire means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Retire from the worldly affairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the worldly affairs. That is retire. We are not ś<span class="Italic">ūnyavādi.</span> The retirement means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our religions are <span class="Italic">dharma, artha, kāma</span> and <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span> It is in a continuity. It is a sort of a string. First you have <span class="Italic">artha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The real thing is they do not retire on account of their strong sense of gratification. That is the reason, not that poverty-stricken. Even though poverty-stricken, still they want to enjoy. This is the basic principle. There is nothing to be enjoyed; still, he wants to enjoy. That mentality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Why with all that glorious past and glorious culture they have to... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the principle, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Nanyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam. Tat-toṣa </span>means to satisfy Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. They don't want to do that. They want to satisfy their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our culture was so built as to do work for Kṛṣṇa throughout the life from <span class="Italic">brahmācārya, gṛhastha āśrama, vānaprastha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where is the question. Unless...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But how they have forgotten this is the greatest, I mean, mystery to me. Because the <span class="Italic">sādhus </span>voluntarily, I mean, embrace poverty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All those, sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This service to Kṛṣṇa has disappeared on account of this <span class="Italic">māyāvāda </span>philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And <span class="Italic">māyāvāda </span>philosophy was necessary to dislodge the Buddhist, degenerated Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādi. Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi.</span> They are practically the same. Buddhists say that everything is zero ultimately. And the Māyāvādīs say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Māyāvādīs, sir, have been proved that if everything is zero, who sees the zero? Who sees the zero?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Māyāvādī says zero, just like the sky. The sky is there, but it is zero. You cannot see the planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But who sees all these things? That is what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he cannot see; therefore he says it is zero. Just like now you do not see the stars, but it is on account of my deficient vision I do not see, and I say, "It is zero," less intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Apahṛta-jñāna. Apahṛta-jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Apahṛta-jñāna </span>Māyāvādīs, they have spoiled the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Do you think, in your opinion, <span class="Italic">māyāvāda</span> was a necessity to undo all the bad effect of the degenerated Buddhism? This followed some three, four or seven hundred years of after Gautama Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it... It might be necessity for the time being. Buddhism also was a necessity for the time being. They are not for all. Emergency. Just like it is going on, "emergency." It is not necessity, but sometimes we have to take emergency. Otherwise how Vaiṣṇavas are worshiping Lord Buddha? Eh? <span class="Italic">Nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jatam: </span>"You are always deriding the Vedic principles," <span class="Italic">śruti-jatam. Sadaya-hṛdaya-darśita-paśu-ghāṭam.</span> This is emergency, that "You have become so much compassionate upon the poor animals because they are unnecessarily being killed." <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra, jaya jagadīśa. </span>He is glorifying, <span class="Italic">keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra,</span> but showing that "You are deriding Vedic principles." So how is that, if one derides Vedic principle, at the same time, <span class="Italic">jaya jagadīśa hare?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because the Vedic principles were not properly understood by those people at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. He directly said, "I don't care for the Vedas." Lord Buddha says. So who will worship a person who directly says, "I don't care for your Vedas"? Shall you go to worship a Buddhist or Mohammedan? No. This is emergency. <span class="Italic">Sadaya-hṛdaya-darśita paśu-ghāṭam.</span> He cannot deride the Vedic principle, but it was necessary at the time. Otherwise these rascals will not stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Today, sir, the more animals are being killed than what they were killed in those days in the name of religion. Today it is in the name of the civilization</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because... No, no. Now there is no religion. "Secular." There is no religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Don't say no religion. Secularism is irreligious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Secular means no religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Irreligious rather than. No religion is also something good. But something other than religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may call anything, but there is no religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmena hina paśubhiḥ samanaḥ.</span> They are animals, that's all. The modern civilized man is nothing but an animal-dressed animal, two-legged animal. The animals are four-legged, and these animals are two-legged, that's all. Or big animal. [break]...<span class="Italic">varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.</span> The leaders of this modern civilization, they are being praised by other animals. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">. Śva </span>means dog and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kharāḥ </span>means asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ... Viḍ-varāha </span>means hogs, and <span class="Italic">uṣṭra </span>means camel, and <span class="Italic">kharaḥ </span>means <span class="Italic">gadha,</span> ass. So these leaders are being praised by these animals: dogs, hogs, camels, and asses. And they are thinking they are very big men. What is the value of prayers offered by dogs, hogs, asses and camels? The general people are dogs, hogs, camels. I think you have read. I have explained how they are camel, how they are dog, how they are hog, and how they are ass. I have explained this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That's the Second Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The modern education means to create dogs. The dog goes door to door and moves the tail, "Please give me if you have anything." So this educated person with application goes, and they say, "No vacancy. Get out." Therefore they are dogs. Educated means dogs. They are creating dogs. In Vedic culture no brāhmaṇa will accept any job. No <span class="Italic">kṣatriya </span>will accept any job. No <span class="Italic">vaiśya </span>will accept any... Only <span class="Italic">śūdras. </span>Only <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now they are keeping dogs in their kitchens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Doggish mentality is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, the people are spending more than thirty, forty rupees on a dog every day. But they won't pay two rupees to a servant, domestic servant in their home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are keeping servants also. But educated dogs. After passing so many examinations, they are seeking after master. And without master they will starve. This is doggish mentality. A big technologist, unless he gets a good job, he is nothing but dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He has got no means to further his technology. He must have some means to further his own technology in the modern times, sir. It is very difficult to further your technology without proper means, instruments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the principle it is dog's business. Unless you get a master, you are useless. So that is dog's business. Just like these dogs here on the beach. Because they have no master, they are forlorn, only barking and going here, there. <span class="Italic">Sanatha jivitaḥ. </span>So we are, every one of us, we are now dogs of the material nature, or just like street dogs. So therefore... Hare Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we should take shelter of the big master, Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be all right. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...<span class="Italic">eva caran nirantaram.</span> This is Yamunacārya's prayer. <span class="Italic">Bhavantam eva caran nirantaram.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? In Honolulu. That means it depends on weather also, not only seaside. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We chant, "<span class="Italic">Gaura Nityānanda bol,</span> <span class="Italic">haribol, haribol...</span>"</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> "<span class="Italic">Gaura śrī advaita...</span>" Is it recommended by you? That is in our <span class="Italic">paramparā? </span>And what about "<span class="Italic">jaya jagannātha, jaya jagannātha</span>"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all right. [break] ...<span class="Italic">anukīrtanam,</span> to chant always the Lord's name. So these are Lord's name. Jagannātha is also Lord's name. Nityānanda is also Lord's name. [break] ...<span class="Italic">harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But chanting in that particular fashion, saying "<span class="Italic">jaya jagannātha, jaya jagannātha.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Chanting means glorifying. "<span class="Italic">jaya jagannātha.</span>" "Please engage me." (to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Police, under police they are. I saw in Delhi. One school I went, and the police is there, examination room, but all thieves, rascals. And they are sitting in examination for passing, all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The modern education has become a farce in that dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Farce, yes. No education. Amongst the Marwaris, the respectable gentlemen, they don't send. They keep private teachers, <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> for learning Sanskrit, English. They know that our, "My boy hasn't got to earn money. He has to sit here. That's all. Why he should be spoiled?" They know very well, "We can purchase these technologists."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything farce. There is no education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In our time we had so much respect for our teachers and what love teachers had for us. One of my teachers in the school retired some time back and then... [break] They wanted to give him 65,000 rupees because he was a seventy-five years. And when we collected from the old students it came to more than six <span class="Italic">lakhs </span>of rupees. That was the love of the old students for the teacher in those days. Now it is this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...infection and disinfection also, but you don't take to disinfection. That is our... Here is disinfection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Who is going to take it? They will prefer to be infected. [break] ...respectable person will send their children to gurukula. They don't want. I tried in the beginning. It was a failure. They don't want. Just like Prahlāda and Hiraṇyakaśipu. What is the trouble? The Prahlāda was devotee, and his father did not like him, that "Why you should be devotee? You become politician, diplomat." That is the difficulty, that nowadays everyone is Hiraṇyakaśipu, and he wants that his son should be diplomat, politician, black market and... What is the use of this Prahlāda? That is going on, especially in India. [break] Hiraṇyakaśipu, he'll never like to see his son Prahlāda. And our system is to make Prahlāda. So nobody will like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They had a <span class="Italic">gurukula </span>here at Hare Kṛṣṇa Land. Isn't it? And many of the children of the tenants were coming, and they were wearing <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> And then they would go home and tell their parents not to eat meat and so on, and the parents became very angry and took their children back. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Hiraṇyakaśipu education, then it is filled up immediately. And if you introduce Prahlāda education-vacant. [break] Hm? (laughs) [break] ...meet me at night, all you. [break] Who are living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Our men? One room is for the school, and Yaśomat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> School, <span class="Italic">gurukula </span>school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The children. Then Yaśomatīnandana's wife was staying there, and Bilvamaṅgala and his wife used to stay there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> One Bilvamaṅgala and his wife used to stay there. So they've left. And Nayanābhirāma and his wife used to stay there and they have left. So actually it could be emptied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I saw yesterday someone living there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, Yaśomatīnandana's wife is gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is some Indian woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You saw her yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, that's probably Bilvamaṅgala's wife before they moved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...modern, that the earth comes in front of the moon or the sun and then there is eclipse. Do they not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They, all the scientists also say the same thing, sir. When it comes in the straight line the eclipse...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. I am saying, repeating their word. But why, then, eclipse takes place irregularly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is a question of simple harmonic motions according to the scientists here who explain it. The simple harmonic motion principle is that several motions are, I mean, going, gathered at a time. Then all of them come together. Then you see that thing occurs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So that motions are different. The different timings come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that means they do not know actually the motions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the old astrologers and scientists of India, they have planned it perfectly, when it comes out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our śāstra says that it is Rahu's attack. So attack does not come regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That you may call allegorically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One... Suppose you have got enemy. You are not going to attack regularly, but when there is some opportunity you go to attack. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Are we not observing this eclipse rituals, that, during the eclipse we stop <span class="Italic">aratis </span>and all of this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And after the eclipse is over, take bath and then do the <span class="Italic">arati?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they take bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even the other Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">mandirs </span>don't do <span class="Italic">arati</span> during that period if it comes within that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Some sort of cosmic disturbances must be occuring in the cosmos during this period of <span class="Italic">gṛhana(?)</span> or eclipse. We do not know, the modern science. Some movement must be happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our <span class="Italic">śāstra </span>says it is attack by Rahu. Rahu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Rahu means...The other side of the earth's shadow is Rahu, as we say. The modern scientists, the Rahu means other side of the shadow. When the sun shines on the earth, the other side of the earth is, I mean, the night and the shadow of the earth is long, drawn up in the cosmos. And in the view of that shadow, if moon comes, then it is caught by the shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the... Rahu, Rahu... Rahu comes in front...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is... The shadow is the Rahu. What else could be? That shadow of earth in the cosmos is the Rahu, most probably to me, because when the moon... Generally moon does not come so very often therein in the purview of that shadow. When it comes, it gets eclipsed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They give that the earth comes in front of the sun or the moon, therefore the shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Earth comes in front of the sun. Then it becomes sun eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So, but why, if the movement is regular, then the earth come regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But there are several movements also. The movement of the earth, sun, and moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means again escaping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All harmonic motions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Many shooting stars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Things should be thought scientifically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the scientifically if you cannot say how many movements are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All the movements that the heavenly stars and other things are going on in a particular way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you do not know what are the movements. You therefore say there are several movements, but you do not know what are these movements. That is not scientific. To avoid the explanation, if the scientist says that there are several movements... But you explain what is that movement? According to our śāstra there is no individual movement. The whole system is moving, making center the polestar. That we can see at night. They have... Star and planet, they have no separate movement. They are fixed up. Just like this tree. There are so many leaves. The tree is moving, so the leaves and twigs, they are moving, not that the leaf is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is a question of relativity, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that we can see, this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, the earth moves round the sun and the moon moves round the earth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the rate of movement is different on either side. And the axis or ground on which it moves also differs. So when all of them collide or sort of a thing, then eclipse comes. That is the modern understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the... When Brahmānanda was speaking that word yesterday, I refuted your argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You were asking, "Why is it Sunday, Monday..." So I explained that the sun is the center of the universe; therefore the sun comes first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, various suns are there. All the stars are the suns of various universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't accept that. No. Sun is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the fundamental difference of opinion that we don't go ahead of it, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why shall I go according to the dictation of the rascals? We are not so rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And now we are define who is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, rascal is meant, who has no authority. They are changing every day. They are changing. We don't change. These rascals are changing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These fundamentals, sir, cannot be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In nineteenth century one theory and twentieth century another theory and then another theory, another theory. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The truth is not changed but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, they are changing. You see here... You have not seen that, our Svarūpa Dāmodara's book? He has given: simply changing, simply changing, these rascals. Changing means rascal. He does not know. "It is this. It is this." Another man, "No, no, it is not this. It is this." Therefore all of them rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> About this Kakubh Kapoor Cakra(?), our scientist, Mihila(?), has planned it, and according to the eclipse and sun and the moon eclipse come. That means his science was perfect. Otherwise it would not come at that particular day, time, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We... Our... Five thousand years ago Śukadeva Gosvāmī said that "As I have heard it, I am explaining." That means time immemorial, the thing is, same thing is coming. There is no change, not that after few days, "No, no. It was wrong. This is now right." Again somebody comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are explaining the truth in their own way. That is the change of theory. But the truth is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the truth of rascaldom, as soon as you change your position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Theory is rascal, but the truth is never rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, truth you do not know. Therefore rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They do not know how to explain. Truth is there, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Anyway, he does not know. Therefore he is a rascal, either you say this way or that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Truth is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, truth is there, but they cannot present the truth rightly. That is rascaldom. Truth is there; that is certain. But they cannot present the truth in right way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You mean they are groping in the dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is rascal. How things are happening-every ten years they are changing their theory. And that has been explained by, not by a layman like me. The Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara, he has explained. He has concluded Darwin's theory completely wrong. You have read that small booklet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he has given reason, quotation, how simply he's speculator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> As a matter of, sir, the whole cosmos is full of, I mean, intelligence. That is God. But then that intelligence is struck in different way to the, what you call the mind, which is embedded in the matter. So, I mean, each one explains it in his own way, as he understands...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You cannot explain truth in your own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The whole truth nobody knows and sees. Even our śāstra says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Things which one does not know, he should not try to cheat others by placing some untruth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is like five blind men seeing an elephant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you should not give the conclusion that "Elephant is like..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then we don't accept... It is very difficult to know the whole truth by any one of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore our process is <span class="Italic">upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ. </span>One has seen the truth. Not these rascals. <span class="Italic">Tattva-darśinaḥ. Darśinaḥ</span> means who has actually seen. There is no change. The advice is <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevaya</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">. </span>These are the quotes. <span class="Italic">Upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ.</span> Not that theoretical. <span class="Italic">Tattva-darśinaḥ. </span>You have to go there. Then you will get knowledge. A blind man goes to another blind man. What is the profit? No profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Andhena andha-niyataḥ.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Andha yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> A blind man must go to a man who has got eyes, who has seen. Then that is right knowledge. Now we are presenting this book, Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. Let anyone come and challenge. Let anyone come. We have got many scientists. They will talk. What is the value of speculation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think some scientists have talked nonsense before you, so you are... (laughs) All scientists are not like that, sir. (end)</div>
