<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja has criticized <span class="Italic">mauna-vrata,</span> like that. They have got so.... [break] ...scientists were not perfect in the past, they are not perfect now, and they will continue to remain imperfect. He has written clearly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So this, our science, is a science of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Not the science of spirit. Am I right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The science deals with all the earthly things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even an earthly thing, that does not mean you shall commit mistake. Two plus two equal to four, that is earthly thing. But if you make two plus two equal to five...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If you make two plus two is equal to one, then that is spiritual. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Apart from spiritual, they are talking and again changing. Sometimes they say two plus two equal to four, sometimes they say two plus two equal to five, and then next they say two plus two equal to three. This is going on. So where is you truth? [break] ...the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, no, you are not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Don't say that. We are <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but because we simply talk of Kṛṣṇa, therefore, although <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> we are not <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. I am talking to my scientist friends, sir. That is which medium they move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The protons, electrons, and they have not come to any conclusion. They are still dividing. NDA? They have found some NDA?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Elementary particles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, NDA?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> DNA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> DNA, that is biochemistry. DNA. (laughs) (Hindi?) This DNA and RNA, these are the special nucleic acids. They actually have the power to procreate new cells. These our Indian..., that, those scientists have.... (laughter) Because I am.... In fact, that company.... I got that bad company just now, this.... So I say "Indian." Very good joke. RNA and DNA are nothing, but we don't know how they work even now. A lot of research is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our study should be that these things we cannot explain, but these things are there, so there is a great scientist. That's it. That much understanding is good. You go on analyzing one after another, so you do not come to the final conclusion. But you see actually it is existing, so it has been done by a great scientist. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa tattva</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...otherwise how things have been arranged like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I said Aryans, not Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone. We don't say Aryan or Indian, but there is a great scientist who has arranged like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The greatest scientist is Kṛṣṇa, God. You call Him by any other name but He is personally present, as He says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even the modern scientists do not learn everything by laboratory. They take knowledge from their predecessor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But intuition does come. The topmost scientists.... The intuition, then they work on that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't become ignorant by themselves. They have lots of help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is ignorance and what is knowledge is very difficult to say. It is a relative terminology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ jñeyaṁ jñāna-gamyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right so far as the spiritual knowledge is concerned, but in the relative knowledge, after all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Relative knowledge is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Aparā-vidyā,</span> what is real knowledge, we don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No? Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because every time we change our opinion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We know from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, sir, that is what I said. You are always talking about <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are scientist of <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">Kṛṣṇa says, so you have to know it like that. That is Kṛṣṇa's energy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And how it is that <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is, I mean, interaction, interaction of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated, and also said, <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> So therefore that is final.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why I say, sir, that Albert Einstein used to see <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.</span> He used to see <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa,</span> God everywhere. In every atom he used to see God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is right conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is Albert Einstein, and that was the grandfather of the modern scientists. So I say the scientists are not as atheist as people think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma(?):</span> When Albert Einstein suggested that there must be a supreme universe, then the other scientists began to say that he was crazy. They said, "He has become too old."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Actually they did not believe his theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are right. I mean, all intelligent men in past used to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...scientist. <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he did not the <span class="Italic">paripraśnena sevayā.</span> I do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he thinks not yet fit to make <span class="Italic">paripraśna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I do it</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is. That is scientist. He thinks himself not fit to make any question. <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the <span class="Italic">praṇipāta</span> is sufficiently mature, then he can make <span class="Italic">paripraśna</span>-accompanied by <span class="Italic">sevā.</span> Otherwise <span class="Italic">paripraśna</span> is a waste of time. According to our Vedic system, we should not make any question to any person whose answer I cannot accept <span class="Italic">toto.</span> Then I shall. Otherwise no use of wasting time. <span class="Italic">Praṇipāta</span> means that you are accepting that "Here I have come. His answer will be complete." No further question. But if there is little doubt, he can submissively make question. Just like Arjuna made question to Kṛṣṇa that "You say millions of years ago You spoke this science to..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vivasvān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "But You are of my age. How I can accept this?" And immediately answer was that "Both of us were present. You have forgotten. I have not forgotten." <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> Accept it. He did not challenge, "How is that? I have forgotten? You did not forget?" And that is nonsense. That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As soon as he questions like that, "How is that You have not forgotten? I have forgotten?" it is not good. Then he is not fit for making question. He should not have made question. [break] ...saw the <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Have you got them here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think we have got, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Six Gosvāmīs. I just look at him. American scientists don't come to my rescue. [break] (laughs) (Hindi) Our <span class="Italic">ātmā.... </span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Kuṇape tri-dhātuke.</span> We are not God conscious, any one of us. Practically hardly for us, small way, perhaps. So we are <span class="Italic">go-khara,</span> then, in right sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he admits that he's a <span class="Italic">go-khara, </span>he's not <span class="Italic">go-khara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's not <span class="Italic">go-khara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's no more <span class="Italic">go-khara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Really? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because <span class="Italic">go-kharas,</span> they cannot understand their mistake. And as soon as one admits that he's mistaken, then he's human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But this <span class="Italic">ātma-dhī</span> in this <span class="Italic">kuṇape tri-dhātuke</span> is very difficult to knock off and establish it in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This <span class="Italic">ātma-dhī</span> and <span class="Italic">kuṇape tri-dhātuke</span> is very difficult to take out, extremely difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you analyze, you can take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is done by Sāṅkhya philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have to analyze, sir, with Sāṅkhya philosophy, by <span class="Italic">jñāna-mārga,</span> that you are not this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you analyze. Just like you take breathing. Breathing is taken as the life, breathing. When the breathing is stopped, then there is no life. So analyze this breathing. What is this breathing? It is air. So when breathing is stopped, then you can take air. There are so many persons here. And by some machine you can put within the heart or somewhere. Let the air go on passing. But that is not possible. Therefore immediately the air is rejected. Then take the bone, the muscle. Everything will be rejected. There is no life. So this is analytical study. And then what remains? That soul. Very common thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kiṁ pariśiṣyate...</span> (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Neti neti.</span> "This not soul, this is not soul, this is not soul." Then still, there is the living force. <span class="Italic">Avināśi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam.</span> Immediately come to the conclusion. But they have analytical laboratory, but they have no brain how to analyze. They are thinking that because the blood has become white, therefore life has been lost. So is it very difficult to make the secretion within the body red?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can make it red.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, sir, they think the body does not extinct with the stoppage of the heart, but it gets extinct after complete disorganization of the brain or what we call...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> You are <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> again <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Double <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Both, they come to <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Now rascal become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means when he becomes double <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> he becomes rascal. (laughter) Single <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> is tolerable, and double <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> means <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Double M.A. Double M.A. means double rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Up to this, sir, heart transplant, I mean, surgery...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) All <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Apareyam.</span> Immediately Kṛṣṇa says, but this rascal will not accept. He immediately says, "This you are analyzing, but these things, these material things-<span class="Italic">apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā</span> [Bg. 7.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is another thing." But that they will not accept. Therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Kṛṣṇa says very clearly, <span class="Italic">apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā.</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Jīva-bhūta.</span> That living entity. So clearly said, but they are so <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> they will not accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) Now it is all right? All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] And Kṛṣṇa is saying, and they still will not believe. Therefore rascal. It is clearly said. After analyzing all this material of the <span class="Italic">kuṇape tri-dhātuke...</span> This body is a bag of this transformation of <span class="Italic">kapha pitta vāyu, tri-dhātuke.</span> So this is not life. That is different. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">apareyam itas tu viddhi me.</span> But these rascals will not believe it. Therefore rascals. Very minutely analyze with this material in the body. What is there? The air is there, the blood is there, the muscle is there, the veins are there, the bone is there, the stool is there, the urine is there-a combination of all these, is that life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, it is <span class="Italic">kuṇape tri-dhātuke, kuṇape.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin.</span> In this hodgepodge combination of matter there is the soul. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam... [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> On account of this, this body is changing. <span class="Italic">Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara prāptiḥ.</span> Very simple thing, but they're so rascal, they will not understand. The whole world is like that. [break] He is speaking Himself. Let us accept it. Every knowledge is there. I am not scientist, but all the scientists come. Our Svarūpa Dāmodara, Doctor, Ph.D., he was defeated three times, four times daily, and then he is now writing book, <span class="Italic">Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.</span> You see? And I was not a scientist. He was Ph.D., but I talked on the basis of Kṛṣṇa's assets. That's all. That is my knowledge. [break] ...this knowledge, very practical knowledge, and if we don't accept it, then what is? It is simply rascaldom. No, yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) No, but you see, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not for you. Kṛṣṇa says that "This is material; this is spiritual. This is superior; this is inferior." He is analyzing. There is no question of.... We have forgotten, therefore He is reminding, but still, we'll not take. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but still, we know that.... I mean, we know that this body is not we. We are <span class="Italic">jīvas.</span> Still, every moment we know; still, we forget to act accordingly. That is what I mean to say, sir. We don't act accordingly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That means the knowledge is not perfect. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthita prajñā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is explained so nicely in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you take simply, then you become man of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Nijam ātmānaṁ brāhmaṇa-rūpam</span> (?)(Sanskrit) But still, even at that time also, we think of what. That is a misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> People. I also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. A devotee never thinks "I am body." "The body is mine, or body is given to me. So this body is given by Kṛṣṇa. Let this body be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service." Then it is all right. Both the <span class="Italic">prakṛtis, parā-prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">aparā,</span> is Kṛṣṇa's. So even if you say that spiritually you can serve, but this is also Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> You cannot reject the body and simply take the soul. That is not possible. It is now combination. So the body, <span class="Italic">karmaṇā manasā vācā.</span> So we are not rejecting this body. Why? This is also Kṛṣṇa's. How can I reject it? Kṛṣṇa's things must be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. This is real philosophy. You cannot say, "This is not Kṛṣṇa's." What is not Kṛṣṇa's? Everything is Kṛṣṇa's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> These Māyāvādīs reject it, that the body is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ, mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo.</span> The Māyāvādī says the whole material world is false. We do not say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (2):</span> We say both are right, <span class="Italic">parā</span> and <span class="Italic">aparā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not say. We say this material world also the energy of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> He claims, "It is Mine," so how you can reject it? We cannot say anything Kṛṣṇa's is false. There is some purpose. I give this example, this finger: here is sensation, and here is no sensation. But both of them belongs to my body. Matter means where there is no Kṛṣṇa sensation. That is matter. And as soon as there is Kṛṣṇa sensation, it is spirit. Our Gosvāmīs' formula is that. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> Everything has got relation with Kṛṣṇa. So.... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the highest fulfillment of <span class="Italic">prema-bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi..., mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo. Mumukṣubhiḥ,</span> this <span class="Italic">mokṣa-vāñchā,</span> they said, "It is false." So <span class="Italic">mumukṣu.... parityāgo phalgu vairāgyaṁ kathyate.</span> It is not real <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> He does not know what is <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vaiṣṇavas.... <span class="Italic">Veda</span> gives to take care all your mind, sensation, body, from that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything Kṛṣṇa's. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa's. That is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mānasa deha geha yo kichu mora, arpiluṅ tuwā pade.</span> All as soon as it is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, it is all spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī, at first he wanted to commit suicide. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "This body is not yours."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "How you can make suicide? You have already dedicated your body to Me. You have no right." This was the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's.... You cannot neglect it. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's version.
