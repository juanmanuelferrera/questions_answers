<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is chance of being accepted all over the world. There is now opposition, and some of the politicians, they're of opinion that "This culture, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, is spreading like epidemic, and if we do not check, in ten years time they'll take the government."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Of America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter) That there is possibility because these young men, they are taking. So everywhere revolution takes place by young men. So if it is actually spreading like epidemic, and young men, they are taking part, so within ten years it is not impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a very good idea, then, to follow it. I'm quite serious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are democratic. It can pull down even a President like Nixon. So if they like, if the majority becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, they can make Kṛṣṇa conscious government. There is no, I mean to say, wonder in it. So anyway, because these youngsters in the Western countries, both in Europe and America, are taking... And the recent telegram we have received... Just see how many books we have sold. (aside:) Make it little less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> (reading telegram) "Dear Śrīla Prabhupāda, please accept our humble obeisances. Here are the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> marathon results for all of ISKCON worldwide for the week of December 17th to 24th."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One week's report.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. And that, too, before Christmas. "One <span class="Italic">lakh</span> 17,644 big books, 90,777 medium books, 63,322 small books, 4 <span class="Italic">lakh</span> 37,420 BTG..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That's our magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Right."And 7 <span class="Italic">lakh</span> 9,686 total." This has come from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our headquarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> One week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> New York. This is from New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's coming from New York, but it's the same for all over America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> "We offer our sincere congratulations. It is, of course, the hand of Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventeen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> copies of our literature sold in one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is the daily income here? They would be interested to know the daily income for their own selves, daily income for the book sales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, book sale? Five to six <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Now, you can just imagine from the sales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And how many people it must be going. This magazine is hardly one dollar. In America one rupee. (Hindi?) ...magazine for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is documentary. And the Europeans and..., they are not fools and rascals that they are interested in purchasing other religious book, not their Bible. You see? So it has got very great potency. So under the circumstances, we should now make combined effort that it can be pushed on more organizedly. I am doing now alone with the help of these... But no Indians are coming. This is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think, with all due respect, many Indians are trying to do things in their own religious sect or in their own districts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, I mean, if you had been to Bharatpur recently, about 5,200 beds were there for <span class="Italic">netra-yajña,</span> for the eyes operation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. That I know. But I am speaking of this culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Culture, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is a difficulty one is giving.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Because in observing <span class="Italic">karma-phela,</span> somebody's taking care of. In <span class="Italic">bhakti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one thing is that we are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is no such statement that you take care of the eyes of the people. There is no such statement. That is your manufactured idea. But we are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. That is the difference. Our preaching is that instead of giving relief to the eyes, give him relief in such a way he hasn't got to accept any more this body with eyes. You cannot make a solution of the problem. Somebody is taking care of the eyes, somebody's taking of the finger, somebody of the hair, somebody of another, genital, and so on, so on. This will not solve the problem. The problem is, as it is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad..., janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> This is intelligence. As soon as you take birth, then you'll have eyes, you'll have eye trouble, <span class="Italic">vyādhi.</span> <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.</span> If you accept <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu,</span> then between <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu</span> there is <span class="Italic">vyādhi</span> and <span class="Italic">jarā.</span> You have to accept. You may give some relief, but you have to accept. So that is not solution. The solution is how to stop this <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.</span> That is solution. That is bigger solution. So we are giving that thing-there will be no more eyes' trouble. The main disease... Suppose one man is diseased, so sometimes he is feeling headache, sometimes eye-ache, sometimes finger-ache, and you are applying some medicine for headache. That is not the solution. The solution is that this man is suffering from this disease. How to cure it? So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is meant for that purpose. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> And as soon as you accept body, <span class="Italic">kleśada...</span> <span class="Italic">Na sādhu manye yato ātmano 'yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">. Asann api.</span> This body is not permanent. So because the body is not permanent, the disease also not permanent. So Kṛṣṇa's advice is <span class="Italic">tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata. Mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 2.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> You make the solution-that is the greatest solution-that how to stop <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu.</span> But that they do not know, that this can be stopped. They are simply busy with their temporary problems. And they are taking it as very great. What is great? Suppose if you have got a boil here. Simply by pinprick. (makes blowing sound) Will it cure? There must be surgical operation. Get out the pus. So this movement is for that purpose. It is not for this <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu,</span> I mean, temporary <span class="Italic">jarā-vyādhi.</span> That is all right, but Kṛṣṇa says-if we take Kṛṣṇa's advice, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>-that is not problem. If there is little trouble, <span class="Italic">tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.</span> Real problem is that <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span> Try to stop it. That is intelligence. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is culture; that is education, not to be very much bothered with the temporary. That is not very intelligence. Give them this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we have got this body. So long you have got this body, you may give relief to the eyes, but another trouble will come. It is not guarantee that by giving them relief to the eyes he gets relief from all kinds of disease. That is go... That will go, going on, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu...,</span> er, <span class="Italic">mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 2.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> So give relief, and the real relief, how to stop... That is our Vedic civilization, that you should not become father, you should not become mother, if you cannot give protection to your children from the cycle of birth and death. <span class="Italic">Pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.</span> This is real problem. Real culture is that "This child has come to me, so we shall train him in such a way that no more accepting body." Because as soon as we accept body.... It is very difficult subject matter, of course, to understand, but <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> teaches <span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> When people forget this problem, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi,</span> Kṛṣṇa personally comes to teach them that "This is your problem."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Guruji, just now the problem is of starvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, starvation... Suppose you are diseased, and if your father does not give you to eat, that is your blessing. <span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And what about...? He will die or...? Or this will go away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are complaining? Suppose your father, he gives you everything. But when you are diseased, if he said, "My dear son you cannot eat everything," is that starvation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all give me answer this. Is that starvation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is cure. This is cure. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetānām eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> God is giving food to the cats and dogs. Nobody is starving. If you are starving, that is your blessing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But then, Guruji, suppose you see somebody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not suppose. We get the reference to the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is our disease. We don't manufacture. We don't manufacture anything. Our point of view is if there is starvation, then we take it: mercy of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tat te nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span> 10.14.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> When we are put into starvation, we take it: blessings of God. We don't complain, that "I did something wrong or there is something wrong, so God has put me into this position. It is His blessing." This is our view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Guruji, my father mentioned about this very beautiful picture just above your head. He was saying it is one of best pictures he has seen of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. And you indicated that there may be a card or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, I have that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Oh. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You want big picture? I can give you one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have got cards printed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I have got lot of the big ones. I think big ones you don't have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's asking for a card.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I have been asked that he wants to keep it on paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have given that picture in my <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in so many languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Here we have it in all different languages. This is Chinese.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That I wouldn't be able to read. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We're just showing that we are placing the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in all languages. This is German. Oh, yes, yes. You're German.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'm a little bit of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this starvation point, we take it as blessing. People generally question that "How God is unfavorable to somebody and favorable to...?" That is foolishness. God is good, but that we do not know. Because we are less intelligent, we think that "One man is in starvation; therefore God is not good." That is our fault. We are not good. We do not understand God. But a Vaiṣṇava says, "Oh, it is blessing." And if he takes like that, then the result is <span class="Italic">mukti-pade sa dayā-bhāk.</span> His <span class="Italic">mukti</span> is guaranteed. In any circumstances, if somebody takes God as good, then his <span class="Italic">mukti</span> is guaranteed. And if he blames God-"Oh, He has put me into starvation"-then he has to suffer. This is the common argument sometimes we meet, "Oh, why God has made somebody so rich and somebody some poor? He is unjust." That is foolishness. God cannot be... He's just, always just. That is God. So unless we have got that firm conviction, then we cannot become devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is why Indians are not joining then. Because they are not joining because of that; they cannot understand what is the reality. Because we try to comment upon the God's actions, "Somebody's poor, somebody's rich, somebody's this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But actually you don't believe in God. That is the disease, godlessness. If we believe in God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If we fully believe... But there are a large portion of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. They don't believe in Him. They think that "God is my servant, or order-supplier"-"God, why you have not done this. If you don't do this, I don't want You." This is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means "God is my servant order-supplier." Actually... This is European mentality. One, my Godbrother, German Godbrother, that Sadananda, he told me, in the last war, when the war was going on, generally women were left. All men were in the battlefield, somebody's husband, somebody's father, somebody's son. So they went to the church. They were going church. Even Churchill also recommended "Go to the church. Pray." <span class="Italic">Duḥkha se saba hari bhaje sukha se bhaje kaya.</span> So, but nobody returned. So all of them became atheist: "Oh, it is useless to go to church. I prayed so much for my husband coming back, but he did not come. Useless." So this is the position. "I ordered God that 'My husband has gone to the war. Let him come back unharmed.' And God did not bring him back. He did not carry my order. I don't want this God." This is going on. When the war was declared, there was no consultation with God. (laughter) Rascal. That time there was no consultation. And when the husband is going to die, he goes to God. This is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> When war was to be declared...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. There was no consul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They had found a final solution to the Jewish problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These politicians, they're everything. And when the war is very acute and the husband is going to die, then God is required. When he does sinful activities, God is never consulted, but when he suffers, then God's consulted. "And if You don't supply my order, then I don't want You." Means he remains: "Don't want You." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swamiji, may I ask one question which I had much discussion with your <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> here. Brahman, the sort of, what we in Hindu philosophy consider as the ultimate Godhead...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Brahman you consider Kṛṣṇa. But He is, of course... He was incarnate. He was one of the <span class="Italic">avatāras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your opinion. That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That is our point which I want to clarify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to take the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> authority. <span class="Italic">Brahmaṇo aham pratiṣṭhā.</span> Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Now, did you not read this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, that's what I want to clarify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> 14.27.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am... This, even on the Eighth Chapter you'll find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Brahmaṇo 'haṁ pratiṣṭhā.</span> Read. Just here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham<br class="calibre2"/>amṛtasyāvyayasya ca<br class="calibre2"/>śāśvatasya ca dharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>sukhasyaikāntikasya ca<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic">[Bg. </span>14.27<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He is the <span class="Italic">pratiṣṭhā.</span> Just like in this room there is illumination. The illumination is spread all over the room. (Hindi-"Please hear") So the illumination is important or the light is important? What is important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The original light. Source of the light. Isn't Brahman the source of the light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all try to understand. Just like the sunshine. The sunshine is important or the sun is important? </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The original sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly, this impersonal Brahman illumination or effulgence, that is the bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> So ultimately Kṛṣṇa is important, not this impersonal Brahman illumination. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti sabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> You see practical example and learn here in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> You'll understand Kṛṣṇa is the origin. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> personally says. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> So Brahman also <span class="Italic">pravartate.</span> But if you don't believe Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that is different thing. Then you cannot be convinced. <span class="Italic">Śāstra-cakṣuṣāt.</span> Your eyes should be through the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> not by manufacturing ideas. So <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> says this.</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-<br class="calibre2"/>koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam<br class="calibre2"/>tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.40]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> that "This <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is the bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa. Govinda." So the rays of Govinda is not so important as Govinda is important. <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> And Govinda personally says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya...</span> <span class="Italic">Sarvasya</span> means everything, including Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> With all due respect, I was talking of Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am speaking of Brahman. Brahman means this <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> You mean that. Yes, I am speaking that. This <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Īśvara</span> is different from Brahman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśvara</span> everyone. But <span class="Italic">īśvara parama</span> is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Parameśvara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Parameśvara.</span> There is two words. One is <span class="Italic">īśvara</span>; one is <span class="Italic">parameśvara.</span> You may be <span class="Italic">īśvara.</span> You may be <span class="Italic">īśvara</span> in your business. So many workers are working under you, and you are ordering, you are regulating, but you are not <span class="Italic">parameśvara.</span> Similarly, you take each and every one, up to Brahma. They may be <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> but he's not a <span class="Italic">parameśvara.</span> <span class="Italic">Parameśvara</span> is one. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Then the last question. Rāma, how do you relate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāma means Kṛṣṇa, the same. <span class="Italic">Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā niyamena tiṣṭhan [Bs. </span>5.39]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is always existing with His different incarnation, expansions, <span class="Italic">rāmādi-mūrti</span>-Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha.... There are hundreds and thousands of expansions. <span class="Italic">Advaita acyuta anādi ananta-rūpam.</span> So Rāma is expansion of Kṛṣṇa. He's God. There is no difference between Rāma and Kṛṣṇa. Just like one candle, and if you light another candle, another candle, so one may be the first, second, third, like that, but in candle power they are all the same; similarly, Rāma is expansion of Kṛṣṇa. That does not mean Rāma is less than Kṛṣṇa. Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha. There are many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is what Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But the translation of the word <span class="Italic">Hare</span> in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Hara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Hara,</span> in English...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Original <span class="Italic">hara.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">lata.</span> The <span class="Italic">lata,</span> when you address <span class="Italic">lata,</span> it is <span class="Italic">late.</span> Similarly, when you address <span class="Italic">hara,</span> the <span class="Italic">sambodhana</span> is <span class="Italic">hare.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Sambodhana</span> is to remove the evil, remove the bad part isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Where is bad? There is no bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa means what? "Brahman, please remove from me the... " Isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Why? It is addressing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Only addressing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Addressing means with some purpose when I address Mr. such and such. Then if you say, "Yes, what do you want to say?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It has no relation with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Relation is there. Relation is there. Otherwise, how can I address him? Relation is there. So this form <span class="Italic">Hare,</span> means Hara, is the potency of Hari. [break] Just like you are a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> You have got your wife, you have got your maidservant. The maidservant is doing something, wife is doing something, but you have many potencies. The managing director is there, but he has got many assistants. Similarly, the Supreme Person has got multi-assistants, potencies. So they are all accepted as Hara, Hari's potencies. So we have to approach Hari through the potency: "O Hare. O the potency of the Lord. O Lord, be merciful." We cannot jump over the Lord without going through the potency. So those who are impersonalists, they cannot understand. But those who are intelligent, they can understand that God is person, He has got multi-potencies, and through the potencies He's working so nicely. This is Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na tasya kāryaṁ kāraṇaṁ ca vidyate<br class="calibre2"/>na tat samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate<br class="calibre2"/>parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate<br class="calibre2"/>svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca</div>
<div class="After-Verse">God has nothing to do personally. As we see a very big rich man, he hasn't got to do anything personally, but he has got so many assistants. They're doing everything. Similarly, <span class="Italic">parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.</span> But when the things are done, <span class="Italic">svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā.</span> The knowledge is so perfect and things are done so nicely that it is automatically being done. And the rascals who cannot see behind there is God, they simply see this nature: "The nature is working automatically." It is not the fact. That is also explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛti suyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> There is <span class="Italic">adhyakṣana.</span> <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro.</span> Even the sun planet, such big illuminative, powerful, it is also rotating by the order of God. So similarly, we are addressing the potencies of the Lord. We cannot jump over God, because potencies are so important. They are actually helping hand to God. So if they are pleased, then God will be pleased automatically. Why we address, "Hara"? "Hare Kṛṣṇa." The Kṛṣṇa's potency, Rādhārāṇī; Rāma's potency, Sītā... Therefore, first of all, Sītā-Rāma; Hare Kṛṣṇa; Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa; Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. We address the first, potency. So if I request your wife, "Mother, give me this help," and if she gives that "This man is very nice," you cannot refuse. You cannot refuse. So this is the process, the appealing to the potency of Kṛṣṇa, "So now I am so much harassed. Kindly lift me and engage me in Your service. Hare Kṛṣṇa." This is Hare Kṛṣṇa. "I have served so many life the dictation of my senses, <span class="Italic">kāmādi.</span>" <span class="Italic">Katidhā na katidhā palita durni deṣaḥ:</span> "My lusty desires, my senses, they have dictated me in so many ways which I should not have carried. Still, I have done it." <span class="Italic">Kāmādināṁ katidhā na katidhā palita durnideṣaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Nideṣaḥ.</span> You are my master. You are asking, "Bring me a glass of water." That's very nice. But sometimes you may say, "You go to that person and speak this lie." I don't want to speak lie, but because I am your servant, I have to do that. Otherwise, my service will be cancelled. So similarly, <span class="Italic">kāmādināṁ katidhā na katidhā palita durnideṣaḥ. Nideṣaḥ</span> is all right, but <span class="Italic">durni deṣaḥ.</span> So we are doing this life after life, dictated by the senses, which we should not have done. But we have done it. <span class="Italic">Kāmādināṁ katidhā na katidhā palita durni deṣaḥ.</span> So "All right, you have satisfied your master." No, no. That is also not the fact. <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ karuṇā na jatā na trapa:</span> "They are neither satisfied, neither they are kind upon me that 'This man has done so much. Now don't order him.' " <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ na karuṇā jatā na trapa.</span> "Then what you do...?" "Now I have rejected him. I have come to Hare Kṛṣṇa-'Please engage me in Your service.' That is my life. I have done all this nonsense life after life. They are not satisfied. So therefore my business is to serve. 'I have come to You. Please accept me.' " That is Hare Kṛṣṇa. Because "I have to serve. I have no other business. So I have served these rascals, but they are not satisfied." <span class="Italic">Na trapa nopasanti.</span> "So why shall I do this business anymore? Yes. You are asking <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> I do that. That's all."</div>

Guru is there. Guru is there, but unless you are actually serious, you cannot get real guru. If you want to be cheated or if you are a cheater, then you'll get a cheater guru. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Give <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Bring <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Now we go to guru for some medical help. We go to guru for some economic development. So you'll get cheater. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But how to engage these people who are desirous who have desire of serving Kṛṣṇa in Bombay? If you are talking about a farm and other things...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We have to find our own ways to come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru is there. Kṛṣṇa. Why don't you find? Why you are blind? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has come.

That means I don't want guru. I want somebody, my order supplier. So how you can be... Because you want to be cheated, you'll get cheater. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmi [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why don't you accept Kṛṣṇa as guru? What is the difficulty? Is there anybody greater than Kṛṣṇa? Do you think like that? What is your idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He is the ultimate. There's nothing more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is the supreme guru. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's the supreme person. So why don't you accept Him as guru? That means you do not want. Then you must be cheated. If gold is available in a gold shop, purchase there. Why do you go to a <span class="Italic">pan-wala</span> to purchase gold? Will you not be cheated? You do not know where to purchase gold, and still you are..., "Where is guru?" Go there, where gold is sold. And if you do not know even there, then you must be cheated. You do not know where is gold is available. Unfortunately you go to a <span class="Italic">pan-wala:</span> "Have you got gold?" He'll give you some gold leaf, that's all: "Here is gold." The real thing is that guru is there, Kṛṣṇa is there. And we are presenting. We are not manufacturing. I do not say that I am guru. Our business is to present what Kṛṣṇa has said. That's all. Therefore I'm guru. Guru is he who speaks Kṛṣṇa's word. That is guru. And if he manufactures, then he is a cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> This is the test of guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the test. Guru...

I am now guru. I am Kṛṣṇa. I am <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span>" That is rascaldom. So if you want such rascal, then you'll be cheated.

One disturbance is there will be no rainfall, and therefore there will be scarcity of food, and government will tax like anything.

Our business is to canvass, "Please take it. Please take it." So we will go on like that. People may take it or don't take it. Our business, because we are servants of Kṛṣṇa... <span class="Italic">Ya imaṁ mad-bhakteṣu.</span> Find out. <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.

That is the most confidential part of His instruction. But still, we have to canvass. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Girirāja:</b></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Asaṁśayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Asaṁśayaḥ.</span> "For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotee, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. So we are trying to do that. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> It will be accepted by the devotees, not the <span class="Italic">karmī, jñānī, yogis,</span> no. Only <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.</span> So we have got two functions: first of all we are trying to make them <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> and then convincing him about this philosophy. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> Without being <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> nobody will understand what is yoga. The beginning is <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si priyo 'si me rahasyam ekam uttamam:</span> [Bg. 4.3] "Because, Arjuna, you are My <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> I'll explain to you. Otherwise it is lost." So without being a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> nobody can understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> However he may say that "I am very staunch devotee. I am reader of...," he will misunderstand. So here Kṛṣṇa clearly says that "This is the most confidential knowledge. And without being <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> nobody will be able to understand." So the preacher has got two different businesses. One side, he has to make <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> The persons will... Because without being <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> he cannot understand. Then he teaches. So these two businesses going on in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. To become <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> there is Deity-"Come here. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:</span> Just think of Me: Just <span class="Italic">man-manā.</span> And become a devotee." And naturally, if he comes to the temple, he'll offer some obeisances, he'll offer some flower, some fruit. <span class="Italic">Mad-yājī.</span> Even a child will offer <span class="Italic">namaskara.</span> In this way he becomes devotee. And then he understands. So we have got two functions. All over the world, whey we are opening these centers? <span class="Italic">Bhakto 'si</span>-to make them <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> And they have become <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> And then you speak something about Kṛṣṇa. He'll learn it. So that is explained here, <span class="Italic">ya idaṁ paramam...</span> Who will surrender? "Huh! I shall go to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. I shall surrender to my senses." Surrender he has to. He's not independent. But <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> Because he's rascal by <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra,</span> false ego, he does not accept Kṛṣṇa-"Huh! Why shall I accept Kṛṣṇa?" He will accept <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> by pulling by the ear-"Come here. Sit down"-that I shall accept. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām...</span> And that... But stop that force. That he does not do. "Better let <span class="Italic">māyā</span> pull me by the ear, and whatever she likes, I shall do." But he'll not like to carry out the order of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is very confidential knowledge, to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. So anyone who tries for this business... That is Kṛṣṇa's desire, that "Try to make these rascals a devotee and convince him about the importance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>" If you do this thing, <span class="Italic">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">,</span> then? What is next line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The next verse? <span class="Italic">Bhaktiṁ mayi paraṁ kṛtvā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Mām evaiṣyasi.</span> "He becomes pure devotee, and he comes back to Me." <span class="Italic">Mam evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the solution: go back home, back to Godhead. <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramam [Bg. 15.6].</span> That is the mission of human life. For that purpose we have to do everything. How to go back to home, back to Godhead. And that point we are missing. We are engaged in so-called philanthropic work. Real purpose of life we are missing. And this can be done only in this human form of life. The Prahlāda Mahārāja says,</div>
<div class="Verse">kaumāra ācaret prājño<br class="calibre2"/>dharmān bhāgavatān iha<br class="calibre2"/>durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma<br class="calibre2"/>tad apy adhruvam arthadam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.6.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Arthardam.</span> Although it is temporary, <span class="Italic">arthadam.</span> The dog will die, and I will also die. Both of our body is temporary. But I can die understanding the importance of life. The dog cannot. That is the difference. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja advises, <span class="Italic">kaumāra ācaret:</span> "From the beginning of life teach <span class="Italic">dharmān bhāgavatān.</span>" So these are the indications in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> We have to do that if we actually want to do something tangible. And if you manufacture ideas, that we can do, but that will not be very much effective.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only bitter. I got some trouble in the teeth. Pap(?) means suspended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Pills are taken or not taken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pills? No. If required I shall take again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> If possible, I'll come tomorrow. Otherwise I'll see you when we come back or I'll see you there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (everyone leaves the room... long silence. Knock on the door)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! Hare Kṛṣṇa! Come on. Just now coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Just now. We came by truck.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So everything is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, everything is all right. I came because I have to pick up one truck which was... It was in an accident, and it was repaired, so we have to pick that up. So I thought I would come to Bombay and also see Your Divine Grace. I heard you're not feeling well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So? When you started from there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We started eleven o'clock yesterday, eleven o'clock in the afternoon, and we spent one night in Shalampur, a nice town. We did some <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> in a Dvārakādhīśa temple, very nice temple. And we stayed with the owner of a trucking company. A very nice place. You look so handsome, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (clears throat) So, how business is going there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, there's no money, so not much can be done. The last two days there was no <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution in the evening, and so the last two days I was there, nobody came. The problem is that since Your Divine Grace left there, the same people would be cooking, these sweeper people. And now they don't want to cook anymore because they work all day, and they say, "We can't work all around the clock, twenty-four hours." So they stopped cooking. And together with no money... So the whole thing has just come to a stalemate. So now another problem is that the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party which we sent out is also not... It came back yesterday, also not going on properly. I know this causes Your Divine Grace anxiety, but I just think I should speak frankly about how I feel about the situation. I think Mahāṁsa is a very nice devotee, but he does everything himself. He's always jumping over everything, and before it can be discussed, he's already done it. Just like he flew here. He flew here, and it costs a lot of money to fly from Hyderabad and back. It costs, I think, about five hundred rupees. And there's no need for doing things in that way. So I don't know exactly how to work with Mahāṁsa. It's not that I fight with him. I just don't know how to work out things so that it comes out in a practical way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use of investing money there? I have already given fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I mean I talked with Mahāṁsa also. I talked with him when he came back day before yesterday. Talked with him very frankly and openly. Of course, he always says, "Yes, yes, yes," and then he just does whatever he feels should be done. And Tejas also... Now, Tejas, for example, he started a vegetable garden, and it was going on very nicely, but then everything dried up because all the workers, they work under Mahāṁsa. They're all accustomed to taking instructions from him. And so the plants were not watered. Mahāṁsa continually put the water someplace else. So now everything that Tejas has done is frustrated. So he feels, "Why should I be here?" Tejas, I think, has something really to offer. I think he's experienced, but if he's not given a field and some space to exercise his talent, he's going to go away, and I feel, without Tejas... I mean there's no one else I can refer to about these matters. I don't know anything about farming. I don't know planting. But Tejas seems to know. And he speaks Telegu also, and he also is one of our devotees. And I have more faith in Tejas than I would any other person who we might consult. But ultimately Tejas is, I think, more important than anyone else because he is your devotee, and he's very faithful and responsible. And one other thing which Tejas... When he was there, he worked out financial..., what he saw was the actual financial picture of how Mahāṁsa had been investing money in the past and what kind of result he had been getting on the basis of labor and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the money which we have transferred, so that is... You are three signatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We are three signatures, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> From that money, nothing has been spent yet except five thousand rupees which went for the first well which was dug, which is not particularly good. They went to a 105 feet, and the well is suitable for about three acres of land. Now, since just this small trip that I made from Hyderabad to Bombay, I can understand the reason that nothing is growing in that part. It's because there's no water. Even if you dig, you don't get much water. That big square well, which is already there right behind the <span class="Italic">gośālā,</span> there is no water in it. It does not fill up. It doesn't fill up. It's not the kind of well you pump out and then it fills up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6) (Indian man):</span> I could not go because without discussing this farm in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, you take rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I'm not tired. I can... [break] The signatures were just a... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Prabhu was telling about the Bombay farm now... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all we must attract people, then give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> If you have no power to attract them, then how..., what is the position? Program means men will do. If there is no men, who will do this program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> In that area, in Thana, they drink at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them do whatever nonsense they are doing. Let them chant and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> We don't mind what they are doing. That is later on. When I was chanting in Tompkinson Park I never asked them that "Don't come here. You are drinking." Everyone was drinking. (laughs) I know that. Everyone had illicit sex. They were coming with their boyfriend, girlfriend. I didn't know that? Was I going to restrict them from? Let them come, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Caitanya Mahāprabhu stressed on this, mass <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> every night. He was not speaking philosophy. Philosophy with Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, not with the mass of people. Mass of people-"Come on! Chant!" Give <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> This was Caitan... What they will understand, philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They won't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mass of people, let them chant and dance and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> So these centers are being opened for mass movement as well as class movement. In the village there is... Hardly you'll get good, educated men. So there is no question of philosophy. Given them chance of chanting and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> It is useless to talk before them our philosophy. They'll never understand. But they will understand <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> is so nice. If there are few grains of <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> even the crows will come, the condemned bird. (laughs) He will also come. You do like this. So if this has been settled, do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I think Mahāṁsa would rather manage the farm himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... You think... I do not know, but manage somehow or other. I want that <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution must go on. People should come in numbers, increase. Whatever you can produce, spend for that purpose. We are not going to produce foodstuff for our starving... It is for them. When they'll understand, they'll work voluntarily: "Yes, it's for us." We are not capitalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Now there's <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> It is a big philosophy, that everything is simply based on following the order of Kṛṣṇa without any expectation of any gain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are success. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is success. Kṛṣṇa says, "Do this."</div>

We have the statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So we have to do this. It is not fashion. It is the fact, sir. And those who want to become immediately <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa... Paramahaṁsa</span> does not mean some bogus men. Just like that <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> advised our Bhagatji, "Anyone going out of Vṛndāvana..." He did not marry for this purpose. You know that letter? Then he stopped. <span class="Italic">Paramahaṁsa</span> has gone away. And <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> is looking after woman, a very beautiful woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that why Bhagatji didn't leave Vṛndāvana? Is that why he didn't want to leave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I don't speak for anyone. But these kinds of <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas</span> are there. They cannot go out of Vṛndāvana. They are so advanced. But in Vṛndāvana, if there is a beautiful woman, try to exploit her. Go on. So I wanted to talk with you about that Saurabha, but he's coming on Monday. No? Because Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked the Gosvāmīs that you develop Vṛndāvana, so Gosvāmīs, they did that. But these smoker, <span class="Italic">bidi</span> smoker <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas,</span> they imitate Rūpa Gosvāmī: "You cannot go." Simply by imitating Gosvāmīs by a loincloth they have become... [break] <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte āche yata naga...</span> All over the world, as many villages and towns are there, preach. But this <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa </span> says, "No, no. I cannot go beyond Vṛndāvana." Kali's..., Kali-yuga <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Practically, if I remained at Rādhā-Dāmodara temple becoming a <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa,</span> then how this institution would have come into existence? That is a fact. But we are not doing. If I would have been a great <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa,</span> not leave Vṛndāvana; I would have been very happy in that room, no botheration. Then how this movement would have been started all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That kind of <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> would have probably been pleased if the movement hadn't started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are against us. They criticize us, all the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs,</span> the <span class="Italic">bābājīs.</span> I have become eyesore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sore for their eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Nitāi left. He was instigated that "Your guru is useless. Find out a better guru and remain in <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span>" This rascal left. He talked with (indistinct). Now where he has gone? Nobody knows where is the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The others are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because they're ordinary men. Man's business is to become envious. An ordinary third-class men, there is always envy. Not only first class, but third class. And what to speak of Vaiṣṇava and <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Third-class men. And the government is capturing them and giving sterilization because there is record-so many abortions in the American Hospital. The <span class="Italic">bābājīs</span> are making pregnant the widows, and they are going for abortion. There are many cases, similar, and there is American Hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> In Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not all. But wherefrom they are becoming pregnant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What is the need for any <span class="Italic">bābājī</span> to get sterilized, anyway?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not to get... Sterilization, they are being forced. The government understand that who is making them pregnant, these ugly widows. They are not coming from Delhi, government servant. (laughter) Bring them, <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas.</span> When I was coming, so many <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa,</span> they advised me, "Sir, why you are going to foreign country in this old age? You are in Vṛndāvana. Just go on with your <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span>" The <span class="Italic">bābājīs</span> gave me advice. And actually, I was seventy years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They don't know <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they don't care for. They say, "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not for us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They say that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the <span class="Italic">bābājīs</span> say. They are for <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata rasa līlā.</span> "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is for third class or lower class who does not..." They are <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas...</span> They are not... Immediately jump over <span class="Italic">rasa-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They discriminate this Kṛṣṇa from that Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The Vallabha-sampradāya, they say that "Before Kṛṣṇa was contaminated, in His childhood, we worship that Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Who said that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Vallabha-sampradāya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Kṛṣṇa, when He was young, grown-up, He became contaminated by the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span>" Therefore they do not touch that Kṛṣṇa. When He was below that age, Bal Kṛṣṇa, He is innocent; He has no desire. They think this is contaminated Kṛṣṇa, and Bal Kṛṣṇa is uncontaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then they don't accept Kṛṣṇa as being the supreme enjoyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I met someone who said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is their theory: "Kṛṣṇa is contaminated. In His young age He's contaminated." Now then why... So-called advanced gentlemen say that "We don't want Kṛṣṇa of Vṛndāvana. We want Kṛṣṇa of Kurukṣetra." They say that. They don't want Kṛṣṇa of Vṛndāvana, dancing with the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, the great novelist, he had written on Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-charitra.</span> He has made distinction, that "Kṛṣṇa of Vṛndāvana is different from Kṛṣṇa of Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa of Dvārakā is different." Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, if the Vallabhas say that they only like Kṛṣṇa before He was contaminated, so what is the specialty of Kṛṣṇa? Everyone is uncontaminated in a young age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But do they take Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme? That is the... This man was saying. So I said, "God is..." You were not present when I was speaking with that...? That "In your estimation, whether God is good or God is bad, He is God. You can think that 'God is not giving the poor man any food; therefore God is bad.' But when you think that, 'Yes, God is good,' then you are devotee." This is going on: "God is good; God is bad; God is contaminated; God is uncontaminated."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> But actually they're atheists, or Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're ordinary men, third-class men. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati... [Bg. 7.3].</span> What they'll understand about Kṛṣṇa, third-class men? <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati.</span> When one is <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> out of them, one may understand. And how these third-class men will understand Kṛṣṇa? If they want to remain on the third-class position, they'll never understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Then why do they imitate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some motive behind. Or they may be in the lower position. By serving, gradually they'll come to the real position. But if they do not hear what Kṛṣṇa said, then just imitates again, same. So if we decide that "Whatever Kṛṣṇa has said, we have to do it at any risk," that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "Kṛṣṇa has said. My Guru Mahārāja said. We have to do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was just reading how Bali Mahārāja decided that he would please Lord Viṣṇu at any cost, and he gave everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> Bali Mahārāja is one of the authorities. In spite of all difficulties, all opposition... His guru is opposition. "No. I shall give Him whatever He wants." <span class="Italic">Sarvātma-samarpane bali.</span> Bali became perfect by surrendering everything. (someone enters) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Sit down. Where is Gopāla?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Yes, I met him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is that some income tax affair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> No problem. Is it at (indistinct). Have you seen notice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Which is? About the constitution, exemption? Ah, no. No, it's not a notice as such, but they're questioning whether we deserve the tax exemption as a charitable trust. They're saying that we are not charitable; we are religious. And religious is not exempt from income tax. So the question is whether we have to change our constitution to fit their idea or whether to establish a separate trust or whether to defend that our present...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First thing is that we have not received any official notice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are bothering about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That's what I say. We have stood...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gopāla is bothering too much about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> No, Prabhupāda, with your blessings, I know the Assistant Commissioner, and he is number three or four in entire city of Bombay and a very much influential center. He's a courageous man also. He's a <span class="Italic">sarvaji</span>(?). And if I will place this problem before him as and when it is necessary, he is there to guide us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So first of all where is the necessity? I have been talking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Why create a problem? Today the problem is not before us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The thing is that the same constitution we've had since the beginning, and we've always got the exemption...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And why you are bothering? He's going Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Even last time the Assistant Commissioner...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Who is there in Delhi, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Gopāla Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Ah, let him go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But let him go, but I think that why unnecessarily bother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Today there is no problem for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. She's only the Assistant Commissioner. Last time also the Assistant Commissioner was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the position...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> To which one you made, Kapoor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No, that was Bhave? There's so many Assistant Commissioners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Yes, there are so many Assistant Inspecting Commissioners. Since we are living in Juhu-our temple is in Juhu-our registered office is at Juhu. So we will come in the jurisdiction of Tirumala (?) Chambers, which is near Naida, which is near...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> So he's the head of the department and entire building, that Sarvaji about whom I'm talking to you. Earlier he was at Hykerbol(?) and that is the flow(?) on fourth side, near Churchgate. And, Prabhupāda, I may give him... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a superstition that one should not lie down keeping the head on the northern side. So one says that "I have no head at all. So why shall I bother about keeping my head this way or that way?" Similarly, keep no head, so there will be no question of keeping northern side or southern side. That I want. We have no such program. You spend all money. I want that whatever collection is there, you spend. There is no account, and there will be no question of income tax. We are beggars. Whatever money you get, you spend. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> So your books will also show you, ultimately at end of year, expenditure, income, equalized, neutralized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I am insisting: whatever money we have got in the bank, spend it for printing. Keep the books. That's all. I am insisting this point everywhere. You kept that money seven thousand, seven <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I was going to spend it. I spent every month, but they came at the end of the month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the botheration came, in Germany. He was waiting for sending the money for food distribution. In the meantime, they created trouble. Anyway, we should be free like that. Spend all money immediately. [break] I say that, that don't keep any more money in the bank. Spend it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> And keep the receipts and vouchers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, that we do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Follow this policy. Just like <span class="Italic">govindāya namaḥ.</span> When you see that the puffed rice is flying in the air, "All right, <span class="Italic">govindāya namaḥ. Govindāya namaḥ.</span>"</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you keep always kitchen, and by drum beating, that, "Anyone hungry within this area, or anywhere, come here.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them chant, dance, and take <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> go away. That's all. No philosophy. Everyone will come.

If we go to a rich man, that "I want some money for this purpose," they will pay. Where is the question of scarcity of money? You cannot say there is no money. A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> can go anywhere: "Give me some money. I want to do this." They are meant for begging. And in India still... Why India? Everywhere. I am speaking of India. Still now, although India is so poverty-stricken and materialized, if a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> goes to beg something, nobody will refuse. Nobody will refuse, especially in the village. They'll never refuse. "<span class="Italic">Baba,</span> (Hindi)." He'll give. Actually our <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> are maintained by begging <span class="Italic">mūrti.</span> <span class="Italic">Mūrti...</span> You...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In villages no <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> starves. As soon as there is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> in the village, so many villagers, "<span class="Italic">Baba, aiye, prasāda paiye.</span> (Hindi)" Daily. Still in Punjab, any <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> goes, he gets invitation. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was in <span class="Italic">tīrtha...</span> That is the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He couldn't fulfill all the invitations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There were too many invitations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">Dāśyu-dharma.</span> Their business will be how to plunder. Because at the present moment the so-called democracy means, to tell the truth, all cunning, third-class, fourth-class men, they are doing. They have no sympathy for the general public. Their only aim is, so long he's in the office, gather as much money as possible. Am I right or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means plunder. So if you remain with no money, who will plunder? Because they are becoming plunderer, you remain without any <span class="Italic">bhūtīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī, when he suspected that they were going to steal, he told, "Get rid of it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) Yes. He immediately offered, "I have got this seven dollars. You take it." He was astrologer. He said, "No, you have got eight dollars. But I'll not take your money." "No, no, you take, sir. You'll not take-somebody will take. I'll give you. Kindly help me." And he chastised his servant, "Why you have taken these dangerous things? So you have got still one dollar. You go back. You don't come with me. And eight dollars I have given him. I'll be free." He thought that "Master is by sentiment leaving home and he is so opulent. Let me go with him and keep some money in case of emergency." Of course, that is... From his part it was right, but he thought that "Without this money, to remain, is more safe than to feel safety by keeping money." Because if the government is plunderer, then there is no other. This time is coming. The government will plunder in the name of taxation, and there will be no rainfall, scarcity of food. So everyone will feel very difficult to maintain the family. They'll leave voluntarily and go away. This is foretold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This milk is not good, eh? Even for you they cheat. I told him specially, "It's for Guruji. Please don't cheat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who cares for Guruji? (laughs) Who cares for Guruji? They think that "Guruji is cheating you-I am cheating your Guruji. What is the wrong?" They think Guruji means cheater. Nowadays, Guruji means cheater. "So you are cheated by your Guruji, so let me cheat your Guruji." That's all. <span class="Italic">Sate satāṁ samācaret.</span> If one is <span class="Italic">sat,</span> cunning, you should be also cunning, more cunning. This is Cāṇakya Paṇḍita's advice, policy. <span class="Italic">Sate satāṁ samācaret.</span> Very miserable condition in this age. Therefore the sane man should utilize the little opportunity of human life in the cent percent Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the proper utilization of life. Try to serve Kṛṣṇa cent percent. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> That is proper utilization. The so-called philanthropy, altruism, humanitarianism, this ism, that.... Bogus.... Not bogus-useless. It will not help. They are pious activities. So, <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> says, pious or impious, both of them are impediments to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we are not interested with pious activities or impious even. We are interested how to serve Kṛṣṇa. Our philosophy is very difficult to understand. Suppose you are giving some medical relief, and if I say that "Why you should waste your time by giving medical relief? Why not give him relief from birth and death?" they'll laugh. Is it not? They'll laugh, that "What nonsense he's speaking? This man is suffering. He immediately requires." We don't say that "You don't give medical relief," but why do you forget the real business? That is our.... Vivekananda said, "What is the use of pouring water in <span class="Italic">tulasī?</span> Better pour water in a eggplant <span class="Italic">saka.</span> You'll get some eggplant." This is.... Vivekananda said. Eggplant is also a small tree, and <span class="Italic">tulasī...</span> So if somebody is pouring water on a <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> leaf for <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> he condemns him, "Why you are wasting time? Pour water on this eggplant. Tomorrow you'll get two." (laughs) This is <span class="Italic">karmī.</span> "God is fictitious. God's service is another sentiment. Do something practical."</div>

No. Even they insult that, "They are empty stomach," it doesn't matter. It is my duty to give him some enlightenment about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Never mind. Let him insult. Nityānanda Prabhu, He was injured. Still, He said, "All right. You have injured. I don't mind. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." This is Kṛṣṇa... "I don't mind you have injured, but I request you that you chant."

<div class="After-Verse">"What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled, and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage." Purport? "There are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification and the other is introspective and awake for the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage or thoughtful man are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization. The introspective sage remains alert in the 'night' of the materialistic men. The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress. He goes on with his self-realization activities undisturbed by material reaction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Prabhupāda, in this stanza, I have not followed a little. That stanza which he just read it. Now, a spiritual-bent-of-mind person, he sleeps in the daytime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Materialist person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> He sleeps in the nighttime, and there's trouble in his thoughts. Whereas a spiritual man, he's awoke in the nighttime and sleep in the daytime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all let us understand what is sleeping and awakening. This is the real understanding. The materialistic man, he's sleeping about self-realization. He has no information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> He has no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Information. But the spiritualistic man, he's awakened in that, that this life is meant for self-realization. So the materialistic man, he does not know. He's kept in darkness of night, and the spiritualistic man is awakened. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Why the night...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Night means ignorance, when one sleeps. Yes. And day is awakening. So what is day for the materialistic person, so that is night for the spiritualistic person. And what is day for the spiritualistic person, that is night for the... Just like a spiritualist person, he has sacrificed everything and he is after God, and they are thinking, "These rascals, unnecessarily, empty stomach, wasting, 'Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa,' chant." They are deriding. And he is thinking that "This rascal got this human form of body. Instead of spiritual culture, he's spoiling his life, cats and dogs." That means in the subject matter where the spiritualists were not interested, he is interested. And in the subject matter, the spiritual person, interested, he is not interested. This is day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Oh, I was taking sometime in literary sense. So it was sometimes confusing me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is literally, that <span class="Italic">yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī.</span> He, spiritualist person, he knows, that "What is the use of the sense gratification? The sense gratification is there in the cats and dogs. Why I am wasting in this way?" That is awakened. What is the difference? A man is having sex life in a very nice apartment, very decorated and nice cot. He is enjoying sex life, that "I am advanced civili..." And the dog is enjoying sex life on the street in presence of everyone. But the enjoyment of sex life is the same. There is no difference either for the dog or the man. So the spiritualistic man, he says that "Why shall I waste my time in sex enjoyment? This is enjoyed by the dogs and cats. I have got this human form of life for spiritual advancement." So <span class="Italic">saṁyamī:</span> "Stop this nonsense. Let me cultivate spiritual life." <span class="Italic">Saṁyamī.</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁyamī</span> means sense gratification stopped. That is <span class="Italic">saṁyamī.</span> And he is not <span class="Italic">saṁyamī.</span> <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram.</span> Because he's not <span class="Italic">saṁyamī,</span> his sense are uncontrolled, so he's opening the path of hellish condition of life. The business is the same-<span class="Italic">āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam</span>-based on this <span class="Italic">maithuna,</span> sex life. So you'll find the fly is doing the same thing, and the dog is doing the same thing, and the human being is also doing the same thing, and the king of heaven, he is doing the same thing. The business is the same. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Only the body is different. But they are thinking that "If in the body of Indra, I can have sex with Śacīdevi, that is advancement." He does not think that the sex life with Śacīdevī or the street dog, it is same. There is no difference. And that is <span class="Italic">jāgarti.</span> That is awakened. There is one word. Where it is, I don't remember. <span class="Italic">Maithunam agaram ajñāḥ.</span> This is.... This material life is a term of imprisonment of imprisonment in sex. Just like imprisonment means you are detained in a place allotted by the government, you cannot go out. So here, this material world, the imprisonment is the sex. You cannot go out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Only sex, Prabhupāda? Or...</div>

Now, as soon as you make a committee to take care of your son, then everything is finished. Is it not? The committee members will finish the son and the son's maintenance and everything. But that is going on. Formerly there was one monarch. He was acting according to the Vedic instruction. So he was responsible. And if there are many votes, by vote a government, a combination of plunderers, what they will take care of the people? It is impossible. Otherwise why there was need of dragging down Nixon? He was elected, wrong elected. Wrong must be. The people are wrong. They do not know who is the right man. Any rascal makes some intrigue, and he gets vote. And then they detect, "Oh, he's the wrong man." Again another is taken. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> And what is the guarantee that another man is right? Because the process is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're continually re-electing a new man. The got rid of Nixon, put Ford in. Now they've got rid of Ford; they've put Carter in. And then they'll get rid of Carter, and they'll put someone else in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām: [SB </span>7.5.30] "Again and again chewing the chewed." But if they make it point that "If one is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I'll not give a vote," then everything will be perfect, nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Some countries fine you if you don't vote. If you don't vote, they fine you just to make people vote, because they know otherwise everybody's so disgusted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. I have never given vote. Since we have got this <span class="Italic">sva-rāj,</span> as soon as the vote question, I go away. Because I think, "Why shall I give this nonsense vote? None of them are liked by me." I avoid it. In my <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life, the municipal board and the..., I avoid. I don't believe in. So give Mr. Asnani some fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Some fruit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cut into pieces.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Prabhupāda, Allahabad, where are you staying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our own camp. You are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> I am not fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going because I have to go to Bhuvaneśvara via Calcutta. So it is on the way. And besides that, it is a big function. And because my health is not good, if Allahabad atmosphere or Bhuvaneśvara atmosphere helps me little, it is... Of all foodstuff, I see the <span class="Italic">kitri</span> is good for me, little <span class="Italic">kitri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Asnani:</span> Easily digested also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I shall begin again <span class="Italic">kitri.</span> (Hindi) [break] ...take agriculture, you must keep cows. Both of them are related.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The cow will be subsisting on the grass, and refused things he'll take. And the substance you take. And even if does not give milk, the stool is useful. And you get food grown by the cows and bulls and milk. You subsist. So by mutual cooperation you subsist. You save time. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why you are bothered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No bother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This I want to introduce. And it has become successful in the Western countries. They are doing very nicely, New Vrindaban. Very nice. And Philadelphia, New Orleans. Men, they're happy. So why not in India? India is mainly agricultural country. On this principle you can take. There is no objection. I left Haṁsadūta in charge, but he left everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Actually, it seems that in your system of management, the basic principle is to depend on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not? He says <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Distress will be if I am disobedient. This is nature's law. And if I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, where is the question of distress? <span class="Italic">Sukha se saba hari bhaje duḥkha se haje.</span> This is one Hindi poetry, that "When one is in distressed condition, he goes to God: 'Please save me. Give me this mercy.' " So <span class="Italic">duḥka se</span> means: "In distressed condition he becomes a devotee." But if he becomes a devotee when he's happy, then where is the question of <span class="Italic">duḥkha,</span> or distress? <span class="Italic">Sukha se saba hari bhaje.</span> When you are happy, at that time if you worship Hari, then there is no question of <span class="Italic">duḥkha.</span> That Vivekananda's policy, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva.</span> Why not <span class="Italic">seva-nārāyaṇa?</span> Why He should become <span class="Italic">daridra?</span> Why not engage in? That he does not know. "He becomes a <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> and I become his servant." Foolish rascal. A discovered philosophy. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> As you have said, it comes and goes attached to the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today or tomorrow. Best thing is so long we have got this opportunity of human form of life, let us cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I came other day also and you were advised by the doctors not to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No-doctor says like that. I see everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So Gopāla Kṛṣṇa told me... That was the first day with the doctor. You accepted that doctor's decision. So it was first day when I came. So Gopāla Kṛṣṇa told me this is the problem as it is, and I'm not disappointed at all. I am one with Prabhupāda so there is no difficulty. So I took a chance today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I did not like that idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but sometimes, Prabhupāda, just to keep... You may not require your body for yourself, but we require your body also for ourselves. So we, all the devotees, always pray to our Lord to give you a long physical body and healthy so that the cause which you have taken up in your hand should be completely fulfilled. This is the way I feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I also desire at least let me finish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I have gone to the Fourth Canto, Fifth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have finished now Eighth Canto, and Ninth Canto is also at the press. Tenth Canto is already printed, this <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> as the summary of Tenth. Now I have to publish in detail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have been praying, Prabhupāda, to Lord Kṛṣṇa that we want him for a long time. Till this movement is fully bloomed and blossomed. So for our sake your body has to last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After all, it is Kṛṣṇa's body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. But what I said we pray for not for your sake but for our sake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. And through you we get inspirations. If we go to wrong path we remember you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The similar question was Sanātana Gosvāmī. Sanātana Gosvāmī, after leaving his..., resigning his post, he was living as a mendicant, and there was no bodily comfort. Naturally there was eczema, and it is wet eczema. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as soon as will meet him, immediately embrace him. So he would say, "Don't touch me! This is not for Your..., touch me. This is the disease..." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu... "I'm touching just to purify Myself." Then he consulted some friends, that "Caitanya Mahāprabhu will not hear me and He'll touch forcibly. Better I give up this body." He desired to commit suicide. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "Do you think it is your body? You already dedicated to Me for My service. How you are thinking in that way? It is not your body." Then his body became release from all this eczema. He was thinking like that, that "Caitanya Mahāprabhu forcibly embraces me and my body is so unclean. Better I shall give up." So He said, "It is no longer your body. You have dedicated the body to Me. You have no right to think like that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We are, Śrīla Prabhupāda, small children. You take us with your fingers to the path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The path is open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. But sometimes we falter in the path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarvapāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> It is open for you. It is open secret.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We make mistakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. But path... <span class="Italic">Mahat sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes [SB </span>5.5.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. That is the difficulty. Although everything is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But I'm sure that with your protection, Prabhupāda, I'll reach the goal which I have contemplated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is giving protection. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarvapāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> But still we are not agreeable. Kṛṣṇa says that "I shall give you protection from all reaction of sinful life." But we are not taking that protection. You simply surrender. It is only process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I am taking your shelter, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not talking of me. I mean to say generally everything is declared. We have to take advantage of this. Then it is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I mean to say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Lord Kṛṣṇa also has said that "My pure devotees are more powerful than Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have all my blessings. You have done so much for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So, Prabhupāda, I can come here till you are here. I thought that I should not, because medically you are not advised to. You talk less, but at least we will have your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Five to seven you can come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is sufficient for us without much... We will take your leave so that you can have rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam?</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> How are your sons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> One was sick for six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He was getting a temperature. He was weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He is twelve years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only? That's all. What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What do you say? He has... He is now in my car. I brought him from Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are living there or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They were staying here. They could not get subsequent accommodations. We have shifted to some hotel here, near Juhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hotel? There is no sufficient place here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He was here, but there were many many life members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Many life members were here, and so there was not accommodation. So they were told or they voluntarily shifted to the hotel. Because many life members came from abroad here on Christmas, and all that. So therefore the accommodation was not there, so some shifted in Juhu. Some hotel. They come here every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Your woman you can live together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They're living together. Both ladies are living together. She wants to buy some land at Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> Just today, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Just today from Madras. I closed the bank account there. Also I was in Madras, there's one movie playing there by the government. The name of the movie is called, "From the Indus Valley to Indira Gandhi." It's a government movie put out, and in the movie there's a picture of the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees chanting and also a display of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> And it's giving... This is a movie put out by the government of India, and it included us in it, and it's very favorable for us. It actually includes a picture of devotees chanting, and it shows the books, saying how this <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is being spread to other countries. I think it is very favorable that the government is now accepting us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Things are going very good for our movement here. Other day I was with one Air India officer, and I told him, "Why don't you attract more tourists and show pictures of Hare Kṛṣṇa and what our activities in India?" To attract more tourists by giving our activities in India. They said we will discuss. They will be discussing with me in the... And of course I will take Girirāja and Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. And one school which is a very famous school in Bombay, center of the city where all the affluent people are staying-that school is very big school, good school-they have agreed that once in a week we can give you forty-five minutes to your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana.</span> So this I will be discussing with Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. And there are about 1500 students in that school from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> can be performed. So the movie, how long it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> It's a one and a half hour movie, and we're in about eight minutes of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Eight minutes. Showing our books? That I want. Let them read our books. Then they'll understand what we are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I just visited also our boat program on the Ganga. Śravanānanda has the boat. They distributed 15,000 <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads</span> in one month in Bengali. Fifteen thousand. So I have challenged Śravanānanda. I told him we're going to distribute more Hindi books on this side of the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there the Hindi is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> But here in this side we're going to start to distribute this Hindi <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> very profusely, just like in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what about <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> Yes. Also that's included. Fifteen thousand <span class="Italic">BTG</span>'s and <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gāns</i> included. The boys are so enthusiastic now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the boat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavabhūtī:</span> Yes. On the boat. But even when we came into Calcutta-it was a two-hour train ride-the boys were not simply sitting. They were going from car to car selling books. One boy he sold fifty <span class="Italic">BTG</span>'s just coming from outside of Calcutta to Calcutta. Just two-hour train ride. He was going from car to car, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," and he would give them Bengali <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> And they are taking very nicely now. All along the Ganga...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They know how to... (laughs) It is for them that the movement is being pushed on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Sincerity in the... Two things are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything they are doing. That is... Because these American boys and girls they are cooperating, this movement will advance. Otherwise I don't get any cooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I wish to retire soon from this my professional business as early as I can, and settle here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> With your graces it can materialize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I got <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much for your coming. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi?) You are our father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] India is still for monarchy. Not for democracy. They would like. If they get ideal king they'll accept it. So if you can, and if she's serious, let her become ideal... People will worship him like God. But she must be sincere. It is a fact. <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā.</span> She must be a pure devotee, then everything will... Let her son become pure devotee, become a devotee... She has respect for our movement. That's a fact. And Home Member also. Otherwise so much propaganda against us, they would have taken some steps. They can take any steps they like. They are in power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I am in power, give the dog a bad name and hang it. Who is going to check me? The same story, the lion and the lamb? No? A lion was drinking water this side and one lamb was drinking water that side. So the lion saw it is very nice food. So he wanted to kill with some plea, "Oh, you are making my water muddy!" "Sir, I am here so far. How I can make your water muddy?" (laughs) In this way he picked up some quarrel and jumped over. So he's lion and he's a lamb. So it is no difficult for the lion to kill a lamb under some plea. "Might is right." There has been so much propaganda and CIA, this Communist propaganda, this <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> propaganda. In Bengal there was heavy propaganda against our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Bhavānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhavānanda. Nothing was done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. It's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Lalitā says that "I know Swamiji is very exalted. I am simply afraid... He has so many American disciples. If some of them do something wrong, that will be very bad thing for him." Lalitā was telling me. What can I do? Come anyone. Who is bad, who is good I do not know. But I know even bad man comes, he becomes a good man. That I know. So who will come? How can I discriminate who is bad or who is good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Lord Caitanya also welcomed everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Caitanya's movement is <span class="Italic">pāpī tāpī yata chilo hari-nāme uddharilo.</span> All sinful men, all suffering humanity, simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, they were. <span class="Italic">Pāpī tāpī yata chilo hari-nāme uddharilo.</span> How it is possible? <span class="Italic">Tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi.</span> You see the Jagāi-Mādhāi, how they became Vaiṣṇava. This is Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's song. So you have to ask anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just one thing. What does... It said in a text in just one wife-about Jarāsandha. Jarāsandha. Actually the story in Mahābhārata is that one half came from one wife and another half came from another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> And it said, <span class="Italic">amyasya mati bayayam sakale dve bṛhad-rathāt ye mātra jarayā cāpi sundite.</span> And they're joined by <span class="Italic">sundite,</span> by Jara. <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvete krīdāṁ kriyā jarāsandho 'bhavat sūta.</span> So <span class="Italic">jīva jīva?</span> Become...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> You had here, "O living entity, just be alive"?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Playing, joining. Get, be alive, be alive. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that Jarāsandha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Then translation, "In the womb of two other wives, two parts were begotten from Bṛhadratha. The mothers, seeing such parts, rejected them. Later on, one she-demon by the name Jara joined the parts." Then sounded like "engaged"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Playfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Playfully, "joined the parts playfully"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Joining playfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Then she said, <span class="Italic">jīva jīva?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Get into life! Get into life!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "And having been joined by Jara in this way..." "In this way, having been joined by Jara, the son Jarāsandha was born. And by joining the parts playfully, saying, 'Get into life.' "</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similarly, the head is there: "Join, join! You live! You live!" Like that. You had no opportunity to play like that? Every...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Every child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If some dish is broken we used to try to join it. That is child's play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> And the thing about Śukadeva Gosvāmī, that he was actually a different... That <span class="Italic">chāyā-śuka.</span> He was different from that other... <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī</span> Śukadeva Gosvāmī, speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> was different from the householder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It said in the purport, <span class="Italic">chāyā-śuka.</span> So you said that is like imitation Śuka, duplicate Śukadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">chāyā-śuka.</span> Yes. Duplicate. Yes. So it is up to date?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> One little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not working nowadays. Still it is not up to date?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I just have to go over a few things then I'm sending out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm doing very little. Anyway...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, it's just this last chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am in the Twenty-second Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes. You're in Twenty-second Chapter. Twenty-first I'm going to send out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And two chapters more will finish Ninth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You did quite a bit last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If people actually taking like that, then there will be a revolution in Western country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't see how they can stop it. They can't stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huge quantity selling. Either Kṛṣṇa's desire... It is Kṛṣṇa's desire. Otherwise a religious book which is not their religion, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Indian. So somehow or other it is being distributed, and they say it is spreading like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Epidemic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Epidemic. So it is a kind of revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And it's not just in one place. It's every country our men have been to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every country. Whole Europe and America. What business they have got to purchase our books in Christmas? They have no business. Why they are purchasing? Huge quantity. I never dreamed even (laughs) that my books would be sold in large quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They sold over one million...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bon Mahārāja published a portion of the <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span> Eleven hundred books. Still lying for the last ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Bon Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he's the rectum of... (laughs) He can pass stool very nice. (laughter). There was no second printing. And so many scholars , MA, PhD, and so on, so on, so on. Our Dr. Kapoor wrote some books. It was given to some Benarsi. They first of all took it, then they refused, "No. We cannot publish."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They won't publish his books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will take it? A philosophical textbook. There's nobody interested. Actually there is no customer for philosophy nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can't... None of these men, they just don't seem to have any realized knowledge. They write things, but it's so dry that no one wants to read it. It's so distasteful. But when you read one of your books it's so full of life. It's just to the point. It exactly describes how everybody's living, how they're thinking, what the troubles and tribulations they're going through, how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somehow or other it is interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. It's so full of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Otherwise why people take it? When I was... I thought that I am giving my imagination, who will take it? It is my imagination. Of course with reference to the modern politics, sociology, everything. Whenever possible I touch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But your preaching is so practical. These other men when they speak, it just comes out... It's just not practical or they don't know how to translate it into action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I try to write. I explained in that verse, <span class="Italic">kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ [SB </span>1.10.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> I've touched all the points in the modern...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> It has a very nice purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out that. <span class="Italic">Kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ [SB </span>1.10.4]<span class="Italic">. Parjanyaḥ...</span> </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I've touched the slaughterhouse, brothel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I just finished reading that <span class="Italic">Perfection of Yoga.</span> It's an amazing book. Each chapter gradually leads more and more to the ultimate goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were my beginning speeches in your country, in America. I was daily speaking in... So Hayagrīva has edited. Hm. What is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That idea I'm still maintaining. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. One requires all these items to fulfill the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the control of the human being. The heavenly king Indradeva is the controller of rains, and he is the servant of the Lord. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king's administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon, and these rains are the causes of all varieties of production on the land. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. Grains and vegetables can sumptuously feed a man and animals, and the fatty cow delivers enough milk to supply a man sumptuously with vigor and vitality."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now Kīrtanānanda has sent so nice sweets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And <span class="Italic">ghee</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have given something all other devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pālikā hid them somewhere. I don't know where they are. Pālikā hid them away so no one would take them. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right then. Preparing first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Kulādri has a box.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First class. And they have got enough milk. When I went there, all nice milk preparation. <span class="Italic">Ghee,</span> sweet rice, these sweets. Ample. All variety. And they have <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> Then prepare <span class="Italic">kachori, samosa.</span> Such nice thing. And how friendly the cows. Just like family members. And they're giving more economically. That's practical. More milk. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton, enough silk, and enough jewels, then why do the people need cinemas, houses of prostitution, slaughterhouses, etc? What is the need of an artificial luxurious life of cinema, cars, radio, flesh, and hotels? Has this civilization produced anything but quarreling, individually and nationally? Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into a hellish factory and warfields at the whims of a particular man? It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with milk." It's nice. You compare the warfield and the factory. I think people appreciate that. You compare the factory with the warfield.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So whatever thought comes to me, I discuss as far as possible. Why these things are... Therefore I want to organize this farm project. Let there be ideal. And it is becoming ideal in America. People are coming even from the school, college, they are coming to see New Vrindaban. And there was section where our enemies, they are not disturbing. So they are appreciating. Still we are not thoroughly organized, but still they're appreciating. They'll appreciate. One day will come they'll appreciate. And other parents, as they come and thank me, "Swamiji, it is our great fortune that..." Many parents came when I was in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's becoming more organized now. They have a Parents for Krishna group now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any sane man will appreciate. Why this father, mother, came to congratulate me? "Swamiji, you have done so..." It is Kṛṣṇa's desire that everyone be happy. They'll take Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with milk because their milk bags were fatty and the animals were joyful. Do they not require, therefore, proper protection for a joyful life by being fed with a sufficient quantity of grass in the field? Why should men kill cows for their selfish purposes? Why should men not be satisfied with grains, fruits and milk, which combined together can produce hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes? Why are there slaughterhouses all over the world to kill innocent animals? Mahārāja Parīkṣit, grandson of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, while touring his vast kingdom, saw a black man attempting to kill a cow. The king at once arrested the butcher and chastised him sufficiently. Should not a king or executive head protect the lives of the poor animals who are unable to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are not the animals of a country citizens also? Then why are they allowed to be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Are these the signs of equality, fraternity, and nonviolence? Therefore, in contrast with the modern, advanced, civilized form of government, an autocracy like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's is by far superior to a so-called democracy in which animals are killed and a man less than an animal is allowed to cast votes for another less-than-animal-man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all (laughing) we have said. You can do one thing. You have got <span class="Italic">nim</span> tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take... I think you have got <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaf dried?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not since we've been in India. We've been using fresh <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got stock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. Not at the moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">nim,</span> if not in <span class="Italic">bara</span> form, if you make some tablet, round. Something sticky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I can take two pills in the morning. That will help. This <span class="Italic">nim,</span> tickly, and <span class="Italic">bara</span> is very good. But you people say that... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">ghee's</span> not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ghee's</span> not good, that I can understand. But without little <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> we cannot eat at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no harm for a small amount. There's not much harm for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to take very little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Wouldn't it be better just to take some fresh leaf?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fresh leaf, how can I chew it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Too bitter. Hm. I'll get some dried. I can dry some on the roof tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not dry. You have to take fresh leaf. But you have to make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just mash it. I can just mash it and make it. That would be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or if you make two or three <span class="Italic">baras</span> with <span class="Italic">nim,</span> that is easy to take, and palatable. With chick pea flour, fresh <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaf paste and equal quantity of chick pea flour. Just fry it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. Like those spinach pakoras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Arundhati was doing that in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> With <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaf?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. She was doing nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You would like those for breakfast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good for the... So if Arundhati makes, she can come and tomorrow make one or two <span class="Italic">baras</span> in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> For your breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are keeping your health all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>January 8, 1977, Bombay</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in Vṛndāvana. And try to organize this Gurukula as their world attraction. That will be your success. Simply teach them nicely English and Sanskrit. And our books are there. And regular habits: going to the Yamunā in procession, timely get up early in the morning, attending class, clean dress, clean bedding, clean room. <span class="Italic">Śikhā-sūtra.</span> The Vāmanadeva gave this description. Where is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I don't know. Pradyumna may have taken it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There were two books. Woman... Girls should be taught how to become faithful wife, how to learn nice cooking, cleansing, dressing. Simple method. There is no objection of their becoming scholar, but that is not necessary. They have got natural inclination to give service by cooking, cleansing, dressing. Cleanliness is the first necessity. That is hygienic, spiritual, and calm, quiet. India has got special facility to remain clean. Only in this country you can take thrice bathing. In other countries... Easy there. In your country there is hot water. There is no difficulty if one practices. I think our men have such practice. But this cleanness is this taking bathing at least twice. That keeps a man very clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. Since I've been taking two baths a day, unless I have two baths I don't feel clean. Sometimes I am very busy and don't get to bathe twice, and then I feel very dirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't feel clean if I don't have three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Also, he also. He also takes. So if it is practiced, it keeps health very nice. I was taking all along. Since I was attacked, heart, they said you should be kept from catching cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You wanted that description of Vāmanadeva as the dwarf <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span>? It says, "Mother earth gave Him a deerskin, and the demigod of the moon, who is the king of the forest, gave Him a <span class="Italic">brahma-daṇḍa,</span> the rod of a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> His mother, Aditi, gave Him a cloth for underwear, and the Deity presiding over the heavenly kingdom offered Him an umbrella. O King, Lord Brahmā offered a waterpot to the inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead. The seven sages offered Him <span class="Italic">kuśa</span> grass, and mother Sarasvatī gave Him a string of <span class="Italic">rudrākṣa</span> beads. When Vāmanadeva had thus been given the sacred thread, Kuvera, the king of the Yakṣas, gave Him a pot for begging alms."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Kanpur there is a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī aśrama.</span> Sometimes <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> they invite the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> to feed them, and when a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is initiated, they give them this pot. So that <span class="Italic">brahmacārī aśrama,</span> the man who is maintaining, he occasionally collects these pots, so, and he sells all these pots to a brass merchant. People give sacred thread, a pot. As they give in charity to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they give in charity to the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It says, "Kuvera, the king of the Yakṣas, gave Him a..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another system is: during the initiation time, somebody becomes godmother of the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> and gives some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's described here. It says, "Kuvera gave Him a pot for begging alms, and mother Bhagavati, the wife of Lord Śiva and most chaste mother of the entire universe, gave Him His first alms."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhikṣa-mātā. Bhikṣa</span> means giving alms. At least every woman becomes a <span class="Italic">bhikṣa-mātā,</span> alms-giving mother. This is system. My mother was <span class="Italic">bhikṣa-mātā</span> to one <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He is the son of our priest. Family priest, family guru, <span class="Italic">vipra-mātā,</span> still in Hindu family, the system is still going on, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> visiting daily, informing, "Today is this <span class="Italic">tithi.</span> The duty is this, the sunrise at this time is..." This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> duty, to go to the neighboring householders, and whatever they give, take. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> art. At the same time, they keep some medicine. Every house there is some ailments. They'll give some medicine. Still. Now it is not so... In our childhood every day some <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> visitor would come. So I will take massage like yesterday, early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Right here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, hm. I want to show again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. Pālikā's in there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why Pālikā is not helping her to get the beads?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She's already got it on. I don't know why she didn't come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi-woman answers in Hindi) Call Pālikā. Just teach her... Take her in the kitchen and teach her how to make <span class="Italic">tilaka</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> How to make <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tilaka, dvādaśa-tilaka.</span> You just go and learn. [break] What is that? [break] Otherwise there is no death. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Actually there is no death. This forgetfulness is death. We have forgotten: "Who was our father, who was our mother, where I was born?" That is death. And otherwise I am the soul, continuing. Just like in childhood so many things we did, but we have forgotten. The forgetfulness is death. The more one forgets, the more one is dead. Otherwise there is no death. <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate vā:</span> "Never takes birth, never dies." Then what is death? Death is forgetfulness. So you can begin now. [break] ...big, big buildings, the same spirit as <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are doing. But this desire to construct very big building, when transferred for Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So we have got this tendency, everyone, to possess money, to have very big buildings and so on, so on. You do it for Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And <span class="Italic">karma</span> means to be bound up by the laws of nature. So? What is...? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">...parāyanaḥ sudurlabhaḥ praśāntātmā koṭiṣv api mahā-mune.</span> "O great sage, out of many millions of materially liberated people who are free from ignorance, and out of many millions of <span class="Italic">siddhas</span> who have merely attained perfection, there's hardly one pure devotee of Nārāyaṇa. Only such a devotee is actually completely satisfied and peaceful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is devotee. It is not so easy. But we are giving chance to everyone to come to that position. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But otherwise it is very, very... <span class="Italic">Muktānām.</span> It begins from the <span class="Italic">mukta,</span> liberated. Liberated means no more material anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That stage is little far for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you follow the vow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The principles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...then it will be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I find that as a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> only sometimes it's a little difficult because a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> has to worry about taking care of his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...family's needs, clothing, this, that. It becomes a problem, where to get the money from. But otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is also different standard. People are not satisfied with simple living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore there is certain age, that "At this age no more such ambition, material. Lead simple life and advance." That is after fiftieth year. This is our Vedic system. In the beginning it is not possible, but by practicing... So if one lives for hundred years, fifty years' extravagancy, "Now stop. Now be regulated and try to be <span class="Italic">mukta</span>." This is the system. But they don't want even up to the point of death, even men like Gandhi and others. They do not want. This morning Indira Gandhi said that "I am for the mass of people." And Vivekananda, "My country." The same feeling as a person, individual person thinking of his family, these people are thinking of his country, a big family, not for the whole living entities, <span class="Italic">jīva.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Nobody is interested in the śāstric injunction. They've lost them all... Temporary... This is an institution to elevate people gradually. [break] If we follow our own... (microphone moving)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is not very difficult. I don't find it very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I used to work in New York outside all the time, but I didn't find it so difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No one will. It is not at all difficult. The principles, the regulation we have started, it will automatically bring them to that stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When one chants sincerely and attends all the temple programs, then automatically one...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stop the fan? Śrīla Prabhupāda, I may not be going to the <span class="Italic">Kumbhamela.</span> I'm going to stay in Bombay and later on go to Delhi and Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. There is Gurudāsa and there others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Because there's lot of work to do, and I'm printing lot of books now, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Plus there's lot of income tax. The income tax is so bad, the government laws, that ISKCON cannot even sell books. Even if we sell books we are considered to be a profit-making organization. We can give books away for a donation but not sell it. They are such... Tomorrow our auditor is coming on site. He's coming with two, one income tax lawyer, who is our new lawyer now. Very nice man.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them chant and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They'll... Everyone will get. Then gradually, as a snake charming, by chanting, chanting, chanting, then they will be subdued. And that is guaranteed process. There is no doubt. Anyone, even a man is like a snake. In material world everyone is a snake, envious. Snake is very envious. You are passing by the side, "Oh! You are passing by my side?" This is snake. No offense. Because he is passing-he has got the poison-he'll utilize it. This is snake. Without offense. If somebody hurts him or tramples him-no. "Oh, you are so daring? You are passing? You do not know I am snake." <span class="Italic">Sarpaḥ kruraḥ khalaḥ kruraḥ sarpāt krurataraḥ khalaḥ.</span> There are similarly men also. Unnecessarily they are envious, offensive, unnecessary. They cannot tolerate others' opulence. Just like our Godbrothers. They are envious. What I have done to them? I am doing my business, trying to serve my Guru Mahārāja. But they are envious because I am so opulent. I have got so much fame, so many influence, so much influence all over the world. Everyone is praising me about... That is ignorance. And this is regrettable because they are posing themselves as Vaiṣṇava. Ordinary man can do that, but they are dressing like Vaiṣṇava, and they are so envious. That Tīrtha Mahārāja, unnecessarily he was envious, whole life fighting, fighting, fighting in the court and died. Simply planning. So who has gone for the beads? Simply planning. So who has gone for the beads?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She's just got some beads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, she's got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let her come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She was just trying to put them on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no woman here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She can help her <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> Call Pālikā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Tilaka</span> is already on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (pause) I think Mathura train also goes early in the morning. You have taken before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Not from Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two, three train goes, one Frontier Mail, one Deluxe Express and another-three trains for Delhi. It takes, altogether, from here to Delhi, nineteen hours. And Mathura, still two hours less. And from Mathura it is six miles. There are buses, ricksha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a woman coming now to put on her neckbeads. (end)</div>
