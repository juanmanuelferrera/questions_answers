<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord over the material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is our... because we are developing a different consciousness... Different... Consciousness is one, but it is being colored under different circumstances. And therefore we have to accept a similar type of body. So if our consciousness is cleansed, then we do not undergo the circumstantial changes by different species of life. That is required. In the human form of life we can do that, not to associate with the modes of material nature, but associate with God. That we can do. And if we associate with God, then we become liberated from the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā. Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> And our real business is how to get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Give up this staying here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness because such consciousness will help us to be free from the contamination of these different types of material consciousness and save us from transmigrating from one body to another. So we accept this different association on account of our strong propensity for sense gratification. Therefore we have to purify the senses so that the senses may be engaged in the service of the master of the senses. <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tat-paratvena nirmalam<br class="calibre2"/>hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa-<br class="calibre2"/>sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Bhakti means to be free from all sorts of material designation. "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am Italian,"-these are all designations of the body. So we have to become free from these designations. And that is called <span class="Italic">nirmalam,</span> purification. And when we are <span class="Italic">nirmalam,</span> without any contamination, then we can engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses. Master of the senses is Kṛṣṇa, or God. Actually, He is master of the senses. Just like I am feeling comfort by using this sense, touch sense, hand, in this way, but I am not master because at any moment this hand can be paralyzed. So I am not the master. The master is Kṛṣṇa. So if it is engaged in the service of the master, then it is in its normal condition. And then we are liberated. And this purification you can take very easily by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa-that means immediately associate with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's name and Kṛṣṇa, nondifferent. So as, if we associate with fire it becomes warm, the quality of the fire comes; as it is materially possible, spiritually it is possible in perfect order. Process is the same. You associate with Kṛṣṇa, and you become Kṛṣṇaite, as pure as Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is therefore advising, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Kirpal Singh also studies <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> I am asking this. Kirpal Singh, he teaches on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Your master, does he study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> My master is a teacher of the science of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that science of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, just like what you have been saying, purifying the senses and becoming in consciousness through a master, to know a way of purification by not..., living(?) properly and thinking properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The idea is purify the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And meditation, meditation. Being devoted, your life will be changed. The master teaches these things, purification. He has written also some books. When he came to America in 1967, I met him personally. And he initiated a group of people. And I was also aiming at that, being a vegetarian a few years prior to that. He accepted me and gave me initiation with the group. And, of course, he went back in about... He stayed in the States about twelve days then he came in Europe. Then he went back. I haven't seen him ever since. I have a picture of him. I carry a picture of him, the leader of, in our movement. (indistinct) meditating on the master. And I try to live up to it, to the teachings. Would you like to see that picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, I have seen this gentleman. In Delhi I have seen him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In New Delhi. And there are the five names of meditation on the back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I can't read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> <span class="Italic">Niran, san, oṁkara, dvāroṁkāra, so 'ham, sat-nām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Sat-nām.</span> Those five names, according to your ways, position, you will be attracted to one of the names. Everyone has a center of power, energy, the way he taught us. Whatever you fear(indistinct), what particular name one(indistinct), some one that you're attracted to meditating on. (indistinct) <span class="Italic">dvāroṁkāra, so 'ham</span> and <span class="Italic">sat-nām.</span> I thought that I met a good master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Mr. O'Grady. Desmond O'Grady and some of his friends have just arrived. They'd like to come and see you and speak with you.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Very well, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> We are very well and very tired. We've been traveling a long, long way, a long road from Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Desmond is a poet. He's written books also, published in London. And tomorrow he goes to Sicily to a convention of poets and writers, international conference for writers and poets. He's representing Ireland, he's coming from Limerick in Southern Ireland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> This is my friend, Michael Robert (indistinct) We are colleagues together since we teach literature, English literature. And this is another friend of ours who has just come from Greece. Everybody seems to be traveling within the last twenty-four hours. This is a young painter friend of mine, Bob Jackson, also from Ireland, whose first time in Italy, out of Ireland, and he's staying with me at the moment. He came back with me from Ireland just a few weeks ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are also writing books, so many. You have seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I have seen some, yes, because some of the friends have come up and...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Oh, yes, but not this particular edition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This we just recently published in German, a German edition. (Yogeśvara discusses books with O'Grady for a minute)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> All these books are illustrated by our artists in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> They illustrated this?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> And Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Sanskrit, which Prabhupāda translates himself and gives the explanation and purport. Every night Śrīla Prabhupāda dictates into a dictaphone, and his secretaries type and edit. And then we have a press in New York which composes and prints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> It's a very nice edition, that Macmillan edition. Very nicely done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have fifth edition within two years. Five editions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Five editions in two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And each time they print fifty thousand books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> This new printing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. In London about few months ago we got report they sold thirty thousand copies in two months.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> In which country of Europe has the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement been the most powerful or successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Every one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere, yes. In Africa, in America, in Canada, in Japan, in China. Most successful in America. Most successful-many men have taken to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> What about Greece?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I never went to Greece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You said you went to the airport and they were chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> I would think they would be in danger in Athens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It is danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> There's no way that this movement could be very successful in Athens or in Greece. Not too many things are successful in Greece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when I was going to Nairobi from London I got down, transit, on the hall. Some young men, as soon as they saw me, they began to chant, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> No, really? In Greece, this was, in Athens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Athens, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Incredible. What about in Rome? What kind of... Do you think they're going... Well, they're asking about problems with the police and getting (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That problem is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Police sometimes harass us, and they become later on tired and do not do anything. (chuckles) Arresting, arresting, they become tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> They become tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> The system gives up. That's a marvelous solution. Because I feel very tired with the system myself. So there's something wrong with the system as being. So maybe you can give me some advice how to beat the system. Because I assure you, here in Rome...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you Irish people, you are never tired to fight. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> No. We've been fighting for three thousand years now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think the fighting is going on still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Very much so. Very badly, very bad now, very bad. What do you do about that? And that's a serious question. Is it morally correct to be sitting here, for me to be sitting here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see, so long people will remain under the bodily concept of life, that "I am this body," "I am Irish," "I am English," "I am American," "I am Italian," so long this misconception will go on, fight will go on. You see? <span class="Italic">Yasyātmā-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātu...</span> There is a verse in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Just like you cannot stop fighting between the dogs and cats. Why there is fighting? Because the dog is thinking, "I am dog." The cat is thinking, "I am cat." Similarly, if I think as Irishman, "I am Englishman," it is the same thing. As the dog is thinking, "I am dog," so if I think, "I am Irishman," "I am Englishman," I am no better than the dog. So as we cannot stop the fighting between dogs, similarly, so long people will remain in bodily concept of life, the fighting cannot be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> What was Mahatma Gandhi fighting in the House of Commons in England?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also another dogism. Because there is no difference. Just try to understand. The dog is thinking, "I am dog." Why? Because he has got the body of a dog. Similarly, if I am thinking, "I am Indian" because I have got the body in the Indian soil, where is the difference? There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> The Englishman thinks there's a difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anyone. The bodily concept of life is animalism. When we think that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul," then there is peace. Otherwise there cannot be any peace. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the Vedic literature it is described that persons who is in the bodily concept of life, he is exactly like the cow and the ass. That means animal. So people has to transcend this qualitative conception of existence. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You will find this verse.

<div class="After-Verse">"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> This verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kṛṣṇa activities. Kṛṣṇa activities are known as <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga-</span>always acting for Kṛṣṇa. This includes not only Kṛṣṇa, but His different plenary expansions such as Rāma and Nārāyaṇa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of Kṛṣṇa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of Kṛṣṇa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of Kṛṣṇa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of Kṛṣṇa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as Kṛṣṇa in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga </span>means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: <span class="Italic">brahmaiva san brahmāpyeti. </span>One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> The best truth, and I think it's truth for most of us who take ourselves seriously...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in our society, we have got Americans, we have got Africans, Canadians, Indians, Christians, Jews, Mohammedans. But they are no longer Mohammedan, American, Christian or African. They are all servants of Kṛṣṇa. And that is Brahmān realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But that's giving it a name also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, name, must be there. But name... Just like you are feeling as Irishman, but your name may be different from another Irishman. How do you feel that "We are all Irishmen"? The name may be different. That doesn't matter. But the quality can be one. That is required. So when acquires that quality, Kṛṣṇaite quality, that in spite of different names... That is called <span class="Italic">so 'ham.</span> One feels... The same example: In a nation, in a group, the names may be different, but because they feel nationally or religiously one, so that is one. Varieties. Varieties may be different, but the object being one, that is oneness. What is that, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā?</span></div>

<div class="Verse">brahmā-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me. Purport."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He gets equality, attains equality position. Yes, purport?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> To the impersonalist, achieving the <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta </span>stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20], </span>oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has nothing to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God's service, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than Kṛṣṇa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20] </span>stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one's individuality becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents' teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaikuṇṭha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Absolute has no internal or external. That is Absolute. If there is internal and external, it is not Absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I don't mean in time, and I don't mean in space. I mean in time in the sense that one is born and one dies, etc., that is, in one's own time, one's own Absolute, ultimately the Absolute that one finds for oneself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not absolute. We, when we are situated in the absolute platform, then we are absolute. Now we are in the relative world. Here there is absolutism, but the sense is not so elevated to understand the absolutism. So so long we are under the control of time, there is no question of becoming absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> So therefore there is a life beyond time.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is absolute. When he goes back to home, back to Godhead, that is absolute. So long he is in the material world, changing body, transmigrating from one body to another, that is not absolute plane. That is the duality plane, dualism. When we go back to home, back to..., in the spiritual world, that is absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> When he goes back to his original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thank you very much. That is the position. That is absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> So you don't find it possible to achieve any absolute condition in our time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In the material world it is not possible. This is the world of duality. Therefore so many different varieties of unity is suggested, but they are all failure. Just like when we were students in 1917, so there was League of Nations. And after that again there was war. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then, now they have manufactured United Nations. But for the last twenty years or more than that, they are endeavoring to be united, but when I go New York, I see flags are increasing, no united, disunity. You see? And war is going on. Therefore, on this material platform this so-called unity is impossible. Unity is possible only on the spiritual platform.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is possibility-when the consciousness is purified. That we are preaching, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now, so long the consciousness is polluted, if I think that "I am Irishman," "I am Englishman," "I am Indian," "I am white," "I am black..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I am Christian," "I am Hindu," they are all contaminated. There is no possibility of unity in the contact of this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> That's very... I'll accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is negation. Then you must say also what you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I am a mortal human being, a member of the animal kingdom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No human being is immortal.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mortal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> That which dies, rots and is forgotten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is some conception, mortality. Mortal? Mortality is not absolutism.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is it. That is the position of the soul. So when there is mortality, that is not perfect stage. And when he attains the stage of again immortality... Because actually he is immortal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Actuality is immortal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Hm, not bad. Because actuality has to do with effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The actuality is immortal. He never takes birth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Never takes bath?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Oh, never takes birth, true. But immortality, I mean, actuality, of course, has to do with the actuality of the situation that we have right now, with you sitting there and we, as friends, sitting with you and engaging in gentle conversation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually... Just like you are sitting in a different dress; I am sitting in a different dress. So the dress does not affect our actuality. We are human being. Similarly, the conception of body-"I am Irishman, I am Englishman, I am Hindu, I am Muslim, I am Christian,"-these are different dresses. So one has to become free from these designations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when one is free from the designations, then he becomes purified.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">So when we become purified, our senses are purified, and when the purified senses are engaged in the service of the master of the senses, that is perfect life. That is nonduality, absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That can be experienced in the present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And practically, you are coming from different groups-Americans, Indians, Africans-but you don't think yourself as American or Indian or African.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But the system insists that you do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The world as it is, the society, the materialistic society, puts these bodily demands...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. The materialistic society means duality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But that's unavoidable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Because of your physical existence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unavoidable, yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> And your personal spiritualism as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it can be avoided in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like the leaf of lily. It is in the water but it does not touches the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I didn't catch that last expression, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Lily leaf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> To show how we can live in this world but still be transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's a lily leaf that sits on the water and even though it sits on the water it doesn't get wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Prabhupāda is explaining we can be in this world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But I don't think you can explain situations in one realm, in one area, in the terminology of situations in another one. Because if you put this element and this element together, you get salt. Now, if human nature was the same with that element in that person and that element in that person, you should also get salt. So if you've got fifty million elements and fifty million elements here you should get a mountain of salt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> If you can try to understand this example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Oh, I can, understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that, salt? Salt example was... Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What was your point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I'm saying its difficult to argue about one kind of situation in terms of another kind of situation when the nature of the problem or the nature of the result is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the kinds or varieties may remain, but sometimes the varieties help. Just like if you bring varieties of flower in a vase, it becomes very beautiful, but they are all flowers. So you have to become flowers. So even in varieties there is unity of beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Yes, I accept that, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...there's a great different between that and what we know today as Christians. They're designations. We are not talking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another point. The thing is that Christ came to preach the message of God. So therefore, to become actually Christ conscious means God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> God conscious, exactly. And to become God conscious means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> To become self conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> To be conscious of who you are yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. God consciousness includes self consciousness. But self consciousness is not God consciousness. God consciousness includes self consciousness, but self consciousness is not God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Well, it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> You may achieve recognition of the God that's in yourself, of that aspect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you are God conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Without being pantheistic, you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just Like if you come in front of the sunlight, the sun consciousness is there, which includes your personal conscious... you also see. In the darkness you cannot see. At night you do not see even your hands and legs. But if you come in front of the sun, or light, then you see the sun and see yourself. So without the sunlight, without God consciousness, self consciousness is incomplete. But God consciousness makes self consciousness very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Well, a lot of young people that we meet in our teaching profession, we don't try to teach them any kind of didactic salvation. But we do try to direct them towards an awareness of what is best and what is most good for them and what is most spiritually nourishing in the world about them, in so far as the system allows us. And I speak of my friend Michael and we here. And the one condition or emotional state-because very frequently the students are not mature enough to be in a spiritual condition, they are in a emotional condition rather than a spiritual one-what we are faced with, is the basic question of "Who am I?" "What is it all about?" "Why am I here?" "Why should I be here"? "Who are you, and who the hell are you to tell me what to think or what to read or what not to read? Why should I read Shakespeare? Or why should I read Saint Augustine? Or why should I listen to Mozart? I prefer Bob Dylan," and these kind of questions which seem to emanate from a very disillusioned state of mind, an insecurity, an uncertainty, and a lack of credibility in the total structure of things as they are. And so we're frequently faced with not just directly having to answer these questions, as I said didactically answering them by saying in a catechismic sort of way: "Who am I?" "You are..." "What am I doing here?" "You are doing this here," which one can do, of course, also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> And so, rather than present the kind of answers that one could present if one was trained in oneself originally... And one who is first of all trained, then one has to untrain oneself, and then one trains oneself from that experience basically. This is my way of seeing it. And then one tries to help others through this course with the same process. Do you think that we should tell them more directly, or... Well, the basic question is how to handle the problem of modern education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our Vedic process is... There are so many questions, as you have already explained. Somebody thinks, "Why I have come here? And what is the purpose? What you are?" So many questions. Questions should be answered by the perfect. Therefore the Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "In order to take answers of all these questions one must approach the bona fide spiritual master."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> One must...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Approach the bona fide spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Approach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> The bona fide spiritual master. If you have none, what do you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> If you are told that Mr. Nixon is the bona fide spiritual master, what do you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got standard. Who is bona fide spiritual master? Just like... The one line, you have heard only one line, that bona fide spiritual master, "You must approach the bona fide spiritual master." But who is bona fide spiritual master? Then that next question. That is also answered, that bona fide spiritual master means <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārtham sa gurum eva abhigacchet, śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the qualification of bona fide spiritual master. What is that? <span class="Italic">Śrotriyam. Śrotriyam</span> means who has heard from the bona fide spiritual master. A bona fide spiritual master is he who has taken the message from bona fide spiritual master. This is the... Just like a medical man is he who has taken the knowledge of medical science from another medical man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Just like Christ took this knowledge from the Holy Ghost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And anyone. Yes. Similarly, bona fide spiritual master means who is in the line of successive spiritual master. The original spiritual master is God. So then one who has heard from God and he has explained the same message to his disciple, then the disciple is bona fide spiritual master-if he does not change. That is our process. We take lessons. We hear from Kṛṣṇa who is the perfect, God. And that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But then, you see my poor old father, living in the west of Ireland, a simple man, at his age, seventy now, your generation, he has gotten to the point at his age where he says, "Well, they tell me, the priests they tell me ultimately it's God who knows. But I want to know who told God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> And then he comes to me and asks me and says, "You went to school and you read big books. Tell me who told God." And so I have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the difference between God and me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> That's the difference between being seventy and thirty-nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no question of... That is explained in the..., that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, Brahma-sūtra,</span> who is God, first of all. Who is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Who told God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all, "Who is God?" Then we shall ask, "Who told God?" (chuckles) That God... That is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>:</span> "Now we should enquire about God, what is God, who is God." Unless you know who is God, how can you raise the question, "Who instructed God?" If you do not know God, then the question does not arise, "Who instructed God?" Is it not? Yes. So therefore God is explained in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra, janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> "God is He from everything comes, emanates." That is God. That God is explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> "The Supreme Being from whom everything emanates." Now, what is that Supreme Being? What is the nature of the Supreme Being? It is a dead stone or a living being? That is also explained. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ [SB 1.1.1].</span> "That God is fully cognizant of everything, directly and indirectly." Unless He is fully cognizant of everything, directly and indirectly, He is not God. So then the same question comes, as you said, that "Who taught God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Yes, that's the man I want to meet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is answered, <span class="Italic">sva-rāṭ.</span> "Independent." That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Independ...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Independent. He is fully independent. He does not require to take lessons from anyone. That is God. That is God. If anyone requires to take lesson from other, he is not God. Who does not require to take lesson from other, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Where does human love enter into it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is there. Because love is also coming from God. So we are being part and parcel of God, there is part and parcel manifestation of love because the original love is there in God. Because nothing can exist. Nothing can exist if it is not in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Therefore we love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The love is also there in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But God is not love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is love. God is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Oh, yeah. Then love is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Our manifestations of love are manifestations of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah... Because we are part and parcel... Just like son born of a particular father, he has got the symptoms, so because there is loving propensity in God and we being part and parcel of God, therefore we have got this loving propensity. This is the conclusion. Unless the loving propensity is there in God, where we get it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Maybe it's generated in you by the need...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no question of "maybe." It must be, must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Oh, very... Yes, I accept the strong word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no question of... Because we have defined God, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> God is He wherefrom everything emanates. That is God. So love, love or even fight. The fighting propensity is also there in God. And loving propensity is also there in God. But His fighting propensity and loving propensity-absolute. Just like in the material world we have got experience, fighting propensity is just opposite the loving propensity. But in God, either fighting propensity or loving propensity, they are one and the same, therefore He is absolute. That is the meaning of absolute. Just like we get from <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> The so-called enemies of God who is killed by God, he also attains perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Yes, the vengeful... Yes, that I understand, the avenging God of Biblical imagination as against... Is it possible to do it all on your own, alone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Abhigacchet</span> means "he must." It is not possible alone. This word, this <span class="Italic">abhigacchet,</span> this verb, is used in Sanskrit grammar... This is called <span class="Italic">vidhiliñ</span> form of verb. So <span class="Italic">vidhiliñ</span> form of verb is used when there is a..., matter is a must. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet, samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyam.</span> And that is the Vedic version. Therefore... You have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You will find Arjuna was talking with Kṛṣṇa. Then, when the things were not solved, perplexed, Arjuna surrendered himself, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam.</span> Find out this verse.</div>

So Kṛṣṇa was advising him, "The opposite party is your enemy. You are a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Why you are trying to become non-violent? This is not good." Therefore he says, "Actually I am now confused. So in confusion I cannot take the right conclusion. I therefore accept You as my spiritual master. You just give me the proper lesson." This is the point. So they were friends. Still, he was confused. So in chaotic condition, in confusion status of life, we must approach the person who is in full knowledge of the things. Just like you go to a lawyer, you go to a physician; similarly, every one of us in the material world, we are confused. Therefore we must go to the spiritual master who can give us real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Right. So, therefore, for example, I am very confused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> He is confused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Very confused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you must approach a spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> And you make a decision, therefore to try to sort this confusion, to make some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spiritual master means who solves all confusion. That is spiritual master. When one is confused, he goes to a spiritual master, and the spiritual master's duty is to save him from all confusion. That is the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. If the spiritual master cannot save him from confusion, then he is not spiritual master. That is the test.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This whole world is confusion, just like a blazing fire in the forest. When there is forest fire, all the animals become confused, "Where to go? How to save life?" It is very good example. When there is fire in the forest, all the animals become confused. Similarly, this material world is just like a blazing fire in the forest. Everyone is confused. Now how the blazing fire in the forest can be extinguished? You cannot take there your man-made fire brigade. That is not possible. Neither bucketful of water. So in this confused state of the human society you cannot manufacture the solution. The only solution is that when there is rain from the cloud on the forest fire, then it is extinguished. That is not in your hand; that is mercy of God. So spiritual master means who has received the mercy of God and he can deliver to the confused man. Then the solution is there. This is very good verse, <span class="Italic">saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam, prāptasya **.</span> One who has received mercy of God, he can become spiritual master. He can deliver the mercy of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> A friend, for example, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> A real friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Well, if one says he's a friend, that's how he feels. A friend is a friend. There's no question of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> True well-wisher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> There's no question of being half-real friend or unreal friend. A friend is a friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the best friend is the spiritual master because he saves from the blazing fire of confusion. That is best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> The problem is to find this friend. The problem is to find this spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no problem. The problem is if you are sincere. Yes. That is stated. Because actually you have got problems, but God is within your heart. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> God is not far away. God is within your heart. So if you are sincere, then God will give you spiritual master. If He knows that now you are sincere, then He will give you a spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> O.K. Thank you. That I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore God is called <span class="Italic">caittya-guru,</span> the spiritual master within the heart. And the physical spiritual master is God's mercy. If God sees that you are sincere, He will give you a spiritual master who can give you protection. He will help you from within and without, without in the physical form of spiritual master, and within as the spiritual master within the heart. That is stated,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">All our questions are answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> very nicely.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directly the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body is just like a machine, and the spirit soul is sitting on this machine, and God is there within the heart. So He is giving the direction. "You wanted to do this. Now you go and do this." This is the... So if you are sincere, "Now, God, I want You," then He will give you directions, "You go and get it." This is the process. But if we want something else than God, then God will give you direction, "You go and take it." He's very kind. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva...</span> I want to have something and He is within my heart, and He is giving me, "Yes, you come here. You take this." So if that God can give direction to give you indication, "You go and take this," why not the spiritual master? First of all we must know, we must be eager to again revive our God consciousness. Then God will give us the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> His Grace must be very tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We can distribute some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Give them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Stay, we have some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Michael Robert:</span> We have heard many profound things here this evening, Your Grace, Your Divine Grace, and I believe that this has been the most useful session and that the poet O'Grady has asked some good questions too. I should like to invite yourself and your followers perhaps to the Overseas School of Rome next Tuesday, if you'd care to come. No doubt your followers who are recording the session so carefully will record the address and the time. Tuesday at the Overseas School of Rome at 10:00 in the morning, if you'll care to come and met our students. They're invited to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's a school in Rome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They want me to go there? Yes, I will go. It is my duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Just to pay a visit, meet the children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is my duty to enlighten people about God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Michael Robert:</span> Thank you all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Please stay for one minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Please take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Stay one minute. So another, I give my request. You are a poet. You describe about God. You are expert in describing. So you just take this occupation, describing God. Then your life will be successful, and one who will hear you, his life will be successful. That is the injunction.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Well, in my experience, the process seems to be that while you begin... First of all, you, for some extraordinary reason, are chosen to do this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that choosing is given. This is this verse: <span class="Italic">avicyutaḥ arthaḥ:</span> "Infallible choice is this, that let them describe the glories of the Lord." This is infallible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> This one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Not his brother, not his sister, but this one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Everyone is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> But I'm talking about the process of ultimately doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, just. When we speak of God, that includes all brothers, all sisters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Yes, but you said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All of them. Not this brother, that brother. All brothers, all sisters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Yes, but what I was saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The God means complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> You're saying that the spiritual master is chosen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I'm saying... Yes, a spiritual master the priest, the poet is chosen by, let's say, God, that is, this person is chosen to write poems or to paint pictures or to make music, compose music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever you do... music also, you can compose...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> That's it... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> O.K., I understand this. But whatever you do, that's it. It's the same thing. End of conversation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not same thing. When you describe... Music, when you compose music about God, that is your perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Absolutely. That is your purpose of life. And when you work in the land, that is your purpose. Yes, that's understood. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda is saying that when you're working in the land...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> That's what you're supposed to be doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. But when you give the results of that for God, that's the perfection of your work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> I know that. I'm aware about that. And when you come in from working on the land and you are eating your dinner, you must do it with the same involvement as you worked the land with, if that is your purpose of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You could say, with the same consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">O'Grady:</span> Yes, with the same consciousness, with the same dedication, with the same devotion, absolutely. And when there's supposed to be singing, the same way, enjoying yourself the same way, and when you're relaxing, you've got to do it with the same devotion, absolutely. No question about it. Otherwise you're being irresponsible. We should go. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much for your coming.</div>
