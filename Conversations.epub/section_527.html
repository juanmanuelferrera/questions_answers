<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...stuff His ears up when anyone would refer to Him as God. He wants to be known as a devotee. But we worship Him as God, in the same line as Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. So how do we understand that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Lord Caitanya doesn't want to be praised as God, but we worship Him as such.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a warning to the future fools and rascals that even God does not like to be addressed as God. But we address Him as God on the strength of <span class="Italic">śāstra. Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣā kṛṣṇaṁ saṅgo-paṅgastra...</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">, yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ.</span> Here is the incarnation of God. That is... <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says. So out of His humbleness, He may say like that, but we should know by following the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> by <span class="Italic">śāstra. Sādhu-śāstra-guru vākya.</span> Guru accepts Him God; <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> accepts Him God; <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> accepts Him God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The people say that just like Rāmakrishna, the disciples presented Him as God, but He never said He was God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then where is the <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span> Three things: the devotee or saintly person, <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and guru. He has no guru. He has no support from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> (laughs) So he's a fool, rascal number one, and he is God. He was a illiterate priest. He had no knowledge of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Besides that, in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said that "Those who are worshiping other demigods, their intelligence is lost." So he was worshiping Kālī. So he had no intelligence or spiritual realization, and he became God? So these things can be accepted by other fools and rascals. But those who follow <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> they will reject immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> What if they say Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a devotee, He worshiped the Supreme Lord, <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> but His disciples say He's God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Simply the disciples have said He's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That... Why do you...? I have already said that He's supported by <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> He's supported by <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> He's supported by learned scholars, means, in the transcendental scholars. And supported by guru. We follow our guru. So guru says; <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says; saintly persons say. Therefore we accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They interpret that verse in another way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, the rascals do. They are... What is their value? When these rascals says that worshiping Kālī, one becomes God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No. No. Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The Rāmānuja and the Madhva, they say, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-varṇam</span> means "black." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣa kṛṣṇam:</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 11.5.32] "But He is effulgent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? No. We should follow our <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, but how to convince them that? They will never accept Cai...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. "You are also <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> but we have got our own <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Why should I follow you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But how to convince them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Convince means they will not be convinced. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-varṇam, kṛṣṇaṁ varṇayati.</span> One who is describing Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-varṇa.</span> And <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-varṇa</span> does not mean black. And again it is confirmed, <span class="Italic">tviṣā akṛṣṇam</span>. So how can they say, "black"? By complexion, He is <span class="Italic">akṛṣṇa.</span> So how they can interpret that He's black?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That it says... They interpret <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-varṇam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. That is foolishness. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-varṇam</span> means <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇaṁ varṇayati iti kṛṣṇa-varṇam.</span> If it is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-varṇa,</span> then how it is again confirmed, <span class="Italic">tviṣā akṛṣṇa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That is His effulgence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his interpretation. <span class="Italic">Tviṣā, tviṣā akṛṣṇam.</span> And in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ, śuklo raktas tathā pitaḥ idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ.</span> So God has other colors also. White and red and yellow. So here is yellow. <span class="Italic">Tviṣā akṛṣṇa.</span> So we have to follow Jīva Gosvāmī. What these rascals, we have to follow? We don't follow. If you have got a interpretation, we have got better interpretation. Why shall I accept you? My mother says, "Here is your father." I shall accept that, or somebody says, "Here is your father" Whom shall I accept? Mother's version. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> We should accept the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> not whimsically anyone's interpretation you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> it's very clear that if one does not accept Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then actually he cannot worship Kṛṣṇa properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now just to carry on with Acyutānanda Mahārāja's point, it would seem then that the Rāmānujis and the Madhvites, they don't accept Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So how can they possibly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they cannot understand the higher <span class="Italic">rasas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Unnata-ujjvala-rasam,</span> they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they can understand <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Dāsya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But not <span class="Italic">sākhya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not more than that. They cannot meditate. There is no paternal <span class="Italic">rasa</span> or <span class="Italic">madhurya-rasa</span> in their community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the Vallabhites, they also... Actually they don't accept Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They say Vallabhācārya is their Mahāprabhu. And they worship in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vallabhācārya was rejected by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, I know that. So actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was simply proud of his education. He had no realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You explained that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Do they worship in <span class="Italic">vātsalya-rasa</span> or just show?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Show, formality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It's not genuine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not genuine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them say that "Kṛṣṇa, becoming, before becoming polluted." They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means childhood age, there is no pollution, and youthhood age, Kṛṣṇa's, it was polluted by the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> This is their version. Kṛṣṇa becomes polluted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, they say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I have spoken to them, in Hyderabad, that Bāla Kṛṣṇa dāsa. And another thing they say is that Rādhārāṇī's name is not mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> So this whole emphasis on Rādhā is not correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Is not correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they cannot understand <span class="Italic">rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛti.</span> They cannot understand. And therefore in their community you won't find any high-class devotee. Simply official sentiment. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I... Is Vallabhācārya...? So he cannot be considered in proper line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Vallabhācārya was rejected by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's in the line with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He accepted him as learned scholar, but He did not accept him as very highly realized soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, you explained that before. His guru, Vallabhācārya's guru, is... He's in Mādhavendra Purī's line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Viṣṇu Svāmī...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They come in the Viṣṇu Svāmī. I do not exactly know who was his immediate guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. I'm just trying to clear these points up because, I remember when I was preaching in South India, this discussion came up, that... Just like Mādhavendra Purī, he found the Deity of Gopāla, and you've explained...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our Gauḍīya. Mādhavendra Purī is Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. You explained how he was worshiping the Deity. Now, that Deity of Gopāla...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Śrīnāthjī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīnāthjī. So that Deity was eventually handed over?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> During Mohammedans, the Deity was moved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And Vallabhācārya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I heard that after the death of Vallabhācārya, Sanātana Gosvāmī told his son to worship the Gopāla Deity. He engaged his son, Vallabhācārya's son, as a <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> in Govardhana. So then it came into their hands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? That may be, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then, when the Deity was moved, it was moved to Nāthadvāra, and now they, now they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the Deity was given to them, they could do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. 'Cause his son was all hopeless that "The <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> is dead and my father is dead." He didn't know what to do. But they have written... They have pictures. They draw pictures of Śrīnāthjī on Govardhana, and Vallabhācārya is worshiping Him, all over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is a big... That's the reason. It's a big mistake. I had a discussion with one man. So I was stating that Mādhavendra Purī found this Deity, Gopāla, but their teaching is that Vallabhācārya found the Deity. I said, "No, Mādhavendra Purī handed the Deity over later on for worship, but it was he who found the Deity and originated the worship on Govardhana, and all the villagers..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has been confirmed in the court that this Deity belongs to Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. There was big case amongst themselves, and the court gave judgement that "This Deity belongs to the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Oh. When was that court case?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Say, about four, five years ago. No, about ten to fifteen years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Recently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Who represented the Gauḍīya...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody, but from the history it was found that it belonged to Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. That... In Delhi one lawyer is there. He knows. He told me. (long pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In our society, some devotees have an idea to spend money by employing professional men to advertise our society in so many different ways through advertising campaigns, etc. My idea is that our money should be spent on direct preaching. In other words, that can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we are spending advertisement, for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, sometimes I know... Just... I mean they hire professional firms to assist in public relations work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not in... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As an example, last year at Ratha-yātrā, two thousand dollars were spent to hire a professional group to assist them in making up the advertisements and other things, giving them guidance, general assistance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you get really assistance, there is no harm. Just like sometimes we go to the court; we pay to the lawyer because we are not expert. In that sense, it can be spent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But cautiously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. For nothing, because you have got money, no. Unless it is urgently or absolute necessary, you should not spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And there should be some... There should be some limitation. We should not spend tens of thousands of dollars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...in such a way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They shouldn't listen to the decisions of these professional men if they say, "Don't do this and don't do that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The president should be restricted that "You cannot spend more than this amount without sanction of GBC."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> When we were in Bombay, there was an organization man, that one gentleman who was discussing with Bhagavān about the general organization of the Society, that you suggested we talk to him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many, they came. They simply talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There was one who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, when we were talking to him, he said that every temple should have its budget, and over that budget, the GBC should sanction. They have two accounts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hums) Hmm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Prabhupāda... [break] Mahāṁsa Mahārāja got the customs duty waiver for the buses from Germany... [break] What about the bullock carts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bullock cart is very good for India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But that's for the small villages. The big towns, they're very far apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm hm. Well, you are not supposed to go to the small villages. (end)</div>
