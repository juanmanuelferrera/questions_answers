<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But suppose you are different...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But, but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is Christian, she is Mohammedan, she is Buddhist. Secular government means government should give protection to the Hindu, to the Muslim, to the Christian, to the Buddhist. But it is the government's duty to see that no one is cheating.</div>
<div class="Lecture">(Prabhupāda and guests converse in Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government's duty to see that people may not become cheated. (Hindi) Let me speak in English, so they can follow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So they can follow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. Take for example a man is representing himself as <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> but he's doing something else. That should be stopped. You are doing the business of a <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i>, why you are claiming as <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa?</i> This is government duty.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Now say this person who is doing wrong(?)...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...is very touchy about his being <i class="calibre3">śūdra?</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why he should be?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, but he thinks that all of us look down upon him. So one has to be very careful. And I think that if you could say something about the real Harijana.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I'll speak, that I'll speak. Now, if he is coming from the <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i> community...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but he is now minister...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He's a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> Not even <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not exactly, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> Not a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But at least he's a <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He's a defense ministry.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, defense ministry is <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya</i> and that is, that is the sanction of the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>.</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam<br class="calibre2"/>yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta<br class="calibre2"/>tat tenaiva vinirdiśet.<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 7.11.35]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the statement by Nārada Muni. I shall quote the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Right (?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya</i>. <i class="calibre3">Kṣatriya's...</i>. <i class="calibre3">Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 4.13]<i class="calibre3">.</i> According to <i class="calibre3">guṇa</i>, <i class="calibre3">śauryaṁ tejaḥ</i>, <i class="calibre3">yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam.</i> These are the <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya</i> qualities. So <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> says if these qualities are <i class="calibre3">anyatrāpi dṛśyeta,</i> if these qualities are found somewhere else.... Suppose a <i class="calibre3">śūdra,</i> a <i class="calibre3">caṇḍāla,</i> if these qualities are found there, then he should be designated by that post, not as <i class="calibre3">śūdra.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many instances but this is the injunction of the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i> And practically also. Suppose a man is a medical practitioner. He may be born in a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> family or <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i> family. Nobody wants to know to which family he belongs to. If he sees that he is a medical practitioner, he has passed the MD examination and that he is practicing then people accept him as doctor, medical man. Nobody asks him, "Are you a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i>, then I make my treatment with you?" Nobody asks that. So, this is śāstric injunction. Then later on this caste brāhmaṇism, śūdraism made the whole thing, whole Hindu culture, Vedic culture spoiled.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Quite right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the.... Now it is the duty of the secular government.... Now if somebody is claiming that, "I am <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa"</i>, then government should force him to become actually a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i> That is government's duty, that is secular state. Not that let people go to hell, we don't care for them, that is not required.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, but if a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> is not behaving...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are claiming to become a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa,</i> you must act as a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> (indistinct) of a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And actions and duty....</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be the platform.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Because if a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> goes on drinking and abusing...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i> How can that be <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa?</i> That is a <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i>, <i class="calibre3">caṇḍāla.</i> Then what is the difference between a.... But they are claiming <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> by birth. That is not allowed in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not allowed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is by our actions and faults(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is said by Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <i class="calibre3">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 4.13]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Never says birth. <i class="calibre3">Guṇa-karma,</i> quality and <i class="calibre3">karma.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One thing more I can do here for all the devotees...[break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Sanskrit teaching in our books.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Language also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Language doesn't matter. Suppose if I address your wife, <i class="calibre3">"mātā"</i> or if I call, "mother". It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One has to understand that a lady should be respectfully called as mother. You call as <i class="calibre3">mātā</i> or mother, it doesn't matter. Yes, some rascals inquire from them that, "Do you know Sanskrit?" Where is the condition that unless one knows Sanskrit he cannot be a devotee? Where is that condition?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In the same way you see early Christians inquired, "Do you know Latin?" And that's why the whole of England wrote it and said we will do only in English.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, one <i class="calibre3">bābājī...</i> I think that you were in Surat?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span>: Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were Surat? He was asking, that <i class="calibre3">bābājī,</i> that, "Learn Sanskrit then you'll understand <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā."</i> So I immediately asked him that, "You go away, you go away from this place."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Not at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he supposed.... I went to preach in the Western countries. Did they know Sanskrit? Then how they have become Vaiṣṇavas? It is a training, it is a training. It doesn't matter whether you know Sanskrit or not Sanskrit. But some rascals inquire, "Do you know Sanskrit, otherwise you cannot become..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is good to learn as many languages as you can, but if not that doesn't matter anything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far I am concerned, although people say I am Sanskrit scholar, but we are not educated as Sanskrit scholar. Whatever Sanskrit we have learned from this book only. A Sanskrit scholar is different, he learns grammar 14 years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> A waste of time, a waste of life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then other side, he takes a whole time, you see?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) greatest Romanian poet and he studies Sanskrit and (indistinct) he's worshiped like Shakespeare in Romania. And (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Germany there are many Sanskrit scholars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Max Muller for example.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Max Muller was not very big scholar, but at the present moment there are many actually scholars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And Lesnee(?), Professor Lesnee(?) was another scholar in Bengali and Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that does not mean he knows the Vedic literatures.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, but they were...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo (Sanskrit)...</i> This is another verse (?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply because you have good brain substance, you'll be a devotee?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no. <i class="calibre3">Bhāvanaḥ(?).</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Bhāvanaḥ(?)</i> means it is, it is by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. If one is sincerely surrendered soul unto Kṛṣṇa, then He gives the intelligence how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. It is not a mechanical way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not a mechanical way. Simply one has to become very serious and sincere, then you develop. <i class="calibre3">yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deva tathā gurau</i>, <i class="calibre3">prakāśaḥ</i> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<i class="calibre3">.</i> He becomes revealed. In the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> it is said, <i class="calibre3">nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ</i> [Bg. 7.25]<i class="calibre3">.</i> He is not revealed to everyone. It requires the qualification how to become a devotee, surrendered soul. (Hindi) Your daughter, as soon as there was <i class="calibre3">kīrtana</i>, how she was dancing?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is young girl.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> She is very devoted.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has the advanced devotion. Therefore.... She is a young girl, she was not ashamed, so immediately she began to dance.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> She has always been like that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is automatic, so this is not an artificial thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no she feels it. That is her mission.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I was very surprised how this nice girl.... Other girls they are also dancing. So this dancing, I was explaining to him that this dancing was not artificial.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is from heart.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ecstatic.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ecstatic, yes. Otherwise nobody will get up at 3:30 in the morning.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Locovāca(?).</i> Doesn't care that here is my mother, here is my father, here is my.... No. Effortless(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> She says today she is going to the park to make a temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, she has got the tendency to become a perfect devotee. As a father and mother you should not hamper it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (laughs) I tell her that too, you know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...because it is not easy to become a devotee.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not easy. <i class="calibre3">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.3]. <i class="calibre3">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.19]<i class="calibre3">.</i> To become a devotee and surrendered soul unto Kṛṣṇa is not so easy thing. <i class="calibre3">Bahūnāṁ janmanām</i>. And if she has developed it is the duty and <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> says <i class="calibre3">pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.</i> These things are there. So, if she has got the natural tendency you should give all possible help to her. This is the duty of the father.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> This is quite right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the duty of the father.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We give it at home, because we told her whatever she wanted to put things, <i class="calibre3">mūrtis,</i> other things, we have installed it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let her enjoy this devotional life. She has developed it. It is a fortune for you because if one member of the family becomes a devotee of the Lord he can deliver all the members. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Prahlāda Mahārāja, his father was Hiraṇyakaśipu, a demon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demon. Demon. (laughs) Prahlāda Mahārāja when he was asked, "Take benediction, whatever you like", he said, "Sir, what benediction I shall take? I have seen the benediction of my father. He was so powerful even the demigods trembled by his red eyes and You finished it within a second. So what is the value of this benediction? Kindly engage me in Your service." Then Prahlāda Mahārāja he did not ask anything for himself, but later on he asked Nṛsiṁhadeva, "Sir, my Lord, one request I can make. My father was great demon, he was against You, but still I pray that his liberation will be granted."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Very nice of him, very good of him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> To save his father.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Nṛsiṁhadeva replied, "Don't be worried about your father. Not only your father, but your father's father, his father, up to 14 generations because a devotee like you, because you are born in this family, 14 generations they are also liberated." Best service. If your daughter can give best service to your family by becoming a devotee. She gives service to you, to your husband, to your husband's father, your father, that is the śāstric injunction.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What exactly is a devotee?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What exactly is a devotee?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotee means he does not know anything better than Kṛṣṇa, that's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But suppose a man who is working in life with always that consciousness, is he...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that consciousness?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That he knows nothing but Kṛṣṇa. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That his actions will prove.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, not action. Just you say the <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> must do by actions.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So a devotee is also by actions he can do it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By symptoms.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Symptoms.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like your daughter, she is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Even she does not like to live with family because she does not find very congenial atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A devotee.... Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura prays, <i class="calibre3">tādera caraṇa-sevi-bhakta-sane vās</i>, <i class="calibre3">bhakta-sane vās.</i> You must live amongst the devotees.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our society he has come from America, he has come from Canada, I am from India, but we have forgotten all our family relations, we have nothing to do. We are in a different atmosphere. They can die for me, I can die for them, but we have no family relationship. He coming from America, I'm from India, he's from Canada, but the central point is Kṛṣṇa. You see? That is devotee. <i class="calibre3">Tādera caraṇa-sevi-bhakta-sane vās</i>, <i class="calibre3">bhakta-sane vās.</i> Therefore we have made this society, Kṛṣṇa conscious society. Anyone who is Kṛṣṇa conscious let us live together. We are also living together in a house-we are eating, we are sleeping, doing this, but everything in a society of devotees. Just like if you want to do some business if you become a member of the association, stock selling exchange, you can do better business.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (laughs) But not all the time.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no I say.... Not all the time because it is material, this is material. They cannot do all the time because this is temporary. You can work as a stock exchange broker for a few hours then it will be havoc(?). But it is not like that. If you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <i class="calibre3">mantra</i> 24 hours, you'll never be worried. You'll never be tired. That is the difference between material and spiritual activities. Just like these boys they are working day and night (indistinct). I do not pay them. They are all qualified. Suppose if one wanted to keep a servant like him, how much he will have to pay? They are doing for nothing. Rather if I become angry they become afraid. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But I also.... No, no, I mean I...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are also helping us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I know, that I know. Therefore you have got such a nice daughter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You see, but I have only this thing that I feel it is my responsibility to look after the family also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the duty of everyone that this movement is so important that people are in the darkness of ignorance. They have become so rascal all over the world. It is not a particular country, all over the world. They are living like cats and dogs, eating, sleeping, mating and dying. And we are giving the information what is the value of life. So every sane man take this movement very seriously.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the leaders they are teaching simply to live like cats and dogs, that's all. What is the business of cats and dogs? Eat, sleep, have sex life and die and defend. What is the difference in this minister? The defense minister is defending. The cats and dogs also defend. Why minister? They have taken it very important.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In some way even the cats and dogs are better, they defend better.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, without money, without soldiers, they have got nails.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span>: Cats and dogs have weapons built-in.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And more over (indistinct) and they are loyal, you see?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, we are thinking now we have got defense measure with atomic bomb, we are now advanced. But what is that advancement? That defense method is there even with cats and dogs. What you have done beyond this? They have no brain. Everyone is spoiling life with these four principles of how to eat, how to sleep. Eating...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Even they don't eat nicely. They eat rubbish.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually they eat all rubbish, but they think like.... It is a misguided civilization.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are practically against all this misguidance of the human civilization.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānas te 'pīṣa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.5.31]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Blind men leading other blind me, this is going on.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I was suggesting, we have got this, ah.... What you call that flower? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span>: (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no, what you call that (indistinct) that flower came?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> White flower, fragrant flower, it is called Parajit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Pārijāta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Pārijāta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> Pārijāta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Pārijāta flower, no? We have got a plant. If you want for this you can have.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, a Pārijāta plant is not here. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is heavenly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We have got here Pārijāta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They call it Pārijāta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They call. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> A very beautiful, fragrant flower.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is (indistinct) (indistinct) flower.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Oh, it is nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is nice, there are many nice flowers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You want some nice flowers. I have got a lot of plants now. (indistinct) Tell somebody to come I can give for the garden here. I have got some marigolds, I have got a few (indistinct). I think they are very nice for the <i class="calibre3">pūjā.</i> Tomorrow you can get that. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So high for these poor people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Such a vicious circle. Higher the prices, higher the wages, higher the wages, higher the prices with less production. If there are five loaves and people have 10 rupees they'll buy five loaves. And if they have 20 rupees also they'll buy five loaves because there are not 10 loaves.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no this high price is due to (indistinct). They are holding stock.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is not sufficient for all these people, population.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you pay them sufficient.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> As it is the stock is so limited.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (speaking in background)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You see what happens.... Suppose you see in a house there are four liters of milk, you see, and each one is given 100 rupees, you see, then they will buy each one, let's say one liter. And if they are given 200 rupees the one who has got 200 rupees, they get one for also 200 rupees, you see? So what is happening is people who have got black money, they want the things for themselves, there is a price there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they get black market?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, because stock being limited. Suppose a medicine is being wanted, a man is willing to give anything for that medicine.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far I have got experience the stock is available if you pay for it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Look at last year's drought over there. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Greater productions is one of the keys to lower prices.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is one of the businessman's tricks. When there is new harvest they purchase and keep it and they keep the stock.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> Store it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when the prices are high they sell it. Now the same process suppose if I want to hold stock, say 100 tons of rice, so I have no money, if I have got 25% price the bank will advance me 75% so I hold the stock.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Now it is an offense to hold the stock.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on in black.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Therefore that should be stopped.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how you can stop?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> By better consciousness, where truth is good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! That requires Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ultimately everything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless you become a devotee.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Quite right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> says, <i class="calibre3">harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā</i> [SB 5.18.12]<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Quite right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are nondevotee they cannot have any good quality.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You see therefore unless you have more production and good quality people...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Production. (indistinct) cooperate. Just like United Nations. We can produce 20 times production that is required.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Quite right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much land.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Quite right. In America, Australia, I have seen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) so little water. You can put plastic sheets to collect water.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will not be any scarcity of food. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, if we work hard.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not work hard, everyone should produce. But who's producing. Suppose in Delhi, such a big city. What is the population?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the population? Tell me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> About ah, four million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four million. And what is the population of Bombay?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> About six and a half million, seven million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven million. And what is Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> About seven and a half million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we say you take.... And what is the population of India?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Five ah, nearly six hundred million now.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six hundred million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Five hundred fifty, six hundred million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you take all these city population it will come to three hundred million. They are doing nothing for producing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, they are producing cotton, textiles.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's alright, but you cannot eat (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can produce bolt and nut but you cannot eat. So this is going on. Formerly everyone was in village. Everyone was interested to produce food. Everyone had got land. Even the <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i> they were not working. The <i class="calibre3">śūdras</i> would work and they produce half and half. Government would tax only 25%.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That would cover everything-shelters, income tax, this tax, that tax, also. And if you not produced anything there was no tax. This was the system, everyone was happy. Here one side there is no production, there is scarcity. Another side government taxes 89, 95%.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> 97%.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> 93%.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And everyone is doing everything, whatever he likes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No trade is going on. We are under the counter (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I just now cut your throat, the police will come, arrest me, note down and the judgement will be given when all your family members will be longer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The judgement won't be given, the police will take money and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Lady Guest:</span> Everything will be over.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This the position. Everything is (indistinct). Therefore most important thing is people should come to his consciousness, real consciousness. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Character.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Character, yes.</div>
