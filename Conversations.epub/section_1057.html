<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...I want to do something in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if you can arrange. Now I am purchasing car, I have given money to Gargamuni...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one car here in Delhi side, one in Calcutta side, one in (indistinct) for my going. And he is a good driver, he will drive. Eh? I do not know but he said. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't know about in India, different thing altogether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Haṁsadūta is also a good driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I am good for nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Driver we'll get, there is no... So I want to preach little in the village. For that purpose in the big bus like that, we shall go with our tents, and we camp in a place where there is water, and begin our preaching. And Hindi book we are getting. In this way let me try in India, in the village, not in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> For us there is no problem Prabhupāda, but it may be difficult for your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No what is difficult? (laughter) But I want to do something for India in the village. So that I... That, we are getting lands, making one center, we can go here and there, not continually. Suppose here is a center, we go sometimes this side, sometimes this side, sometimes come back again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Find one good camping spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You go early in the morning and do something. If it is favorable... Just like in Bengal they are doing. (They get) good reception. You have heard it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, I heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good reception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Villagers give the best reception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Because they're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They're still faithful to culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Unless we get the farm, this farming scheme set up within the next...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are getting so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We're getting the farms but we haven't got the management so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Management that is in your hands. You have to... Who will give you management? You have to manage local, local men. Bon Mahārāja was failure that he could not get the local men. But I did not try to bring men from India and preach in England or America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is it possible? The British Empire was established on management. They did not bring men from England. Few managers, that's all. That is called management. One man can control hundreds and thousands of men, that is management. (long pause) Locally attracted. These Britishers came here and they introduced this <span class="Italic">zamindari</span> system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Zamindari</span> system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Zamindar.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Landlord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So any third class man, if he's given some land, naturally he will be very much pleased. They created that aristocracy. So he selected some men that you give me four annas per <span class="Italic">bigha</span> and what ever you can collect that is your... That is the old system in India, <span class="Italic">zamindari</span> system. So collector, collector, the local collector, he appointed somebody. They used to give one lease, that you give government four annas per <span class="Italic">bigha,</span> and whatever you can collect, that is your business. So that created an aristocratic society and they all supported Britishers, because they're obliged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly in business also, they appointed brokers, that I am bringing cloth from Manchester and if you can sell you'll get so much commission. So without any investment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They were in business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A broker club business. So the businessmen, the <span class="Italic">zamindars,</span> and gradually they started their factories, railways, in this way they started. And they are big politicians, so it is their management. And they failed when things were mismanaged. First of all they created friendship, and later on when they were in power, they created enmity. Then it is failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all friendship, and that established them. And then they began to create enmity. Hindus against Muslim, Muslim... They wanted to stay. When they forgot this idea that if they wanted to stay for the benefit of the people, nobody could drive them away. But their policy was for the benefit of the English people. Therefore they failed. Lord Curzon, he says a statement that, "If you want to stay in India, rule India for the benefit of Indian people. You can keep control over India. They are fond of kings, so one member of the royal family can become king here and they'll earn respect and honor (from) these Indian people. But rule for their benefit. Then British Empire will stay." Very good advice, but his advice was not taken. You have seen Lord Curzon's statue near the, in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a very good governor-general. Many gentlemen came, they wrote very conscientiously and the last one, that rascal Chelmsford (chuckles), he created havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw in London... Near London there is a village, Chelmsford, and he is Lord Chelmsford. We thought Chelmsford, the big state. (laughter) We were under the impression, Thames River is four times bigger than Ganges and (laughter) it is a canal. When I saw it, it is nothing but a canal. But they advertise this river, very big river. And underneath the water, men are going, and upper and wonderful. Big Ben, that Big Ben advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Parliament. All photograph (laughter) actually. Downing Street, 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister's office and so on. And actually it's all (chuckles) no importance. Parliament, big, big advertisement. People are still going, they are paying fees to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now that is their income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, tourism is their big source of income, now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is always cloudy; people are going to see the West Minister Abbey and Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The whole tourist industry runs on propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> When you get there, there is nothing to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Parliament they have got old records bound up, almirah. You have seen? What it will do now? Speech of such and such person, speech of... (long pause) What they... Why this water is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well they are watering the garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Were you thinking of any particular time, when you wanted to do this village program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. I have no where experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Haṁsadūta Mahārāja has traveled around...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You can do it from here even. You can start track from Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think some car has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Maybe that's Bhīma, I'll check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Maybe you could do it from Bengal, from Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Do the villages there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Here the weather is already getting cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And in Hyderabad the peoples don't speak Hindi, that's where I'm coming from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Bengal seems like the best place, because right now at least the weather is really nice. And Gargamuni's men have a lot of experience there, Satadhanya and Jayapatāka. They know all the villages. Could do some good programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This blood pressure is troubling. [break] They are chanting, "Say Kṛṣṇa." (laughter) They're taking, "Mind control."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, mind control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ordinarily they cannot charge anything, mind control brainwashing, subtle thing. Just like I, "I am sick." "How you are feeling?" "I am feeling some pain." (indistinct) Who is going to see? (laughter) Who can say? It is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you say that, I am feeling some pain in this brain or in there, who is going to see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, who can prove it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you have to believe me, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I noticed in several of the articles though, they mentioned that this District Attorney is now going to expand his investigation to see where the money goes. This is what they're really interested in. And when they see... What will happen is, when they see that some of the devotees collecting three, four hundred dollars on the street, then they will print this in the newspaper and in this way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they collect money by selling book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I know but people don't understand this. They simply see that, "Oh, these are astronomical sums of money being collected. So what is being done with this money by people who are just chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? What do they do with it?" Then, "Oh, they have bought this big building in New York, they are doing spending money like this, like that." Ultimately this is what it always come to, money. They want to see what is happening with the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And similarly here also, "Where they are getting money?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, because wherever there is money transaction, the government wants to take some. They feel, "Well, we should have some of this money for ourselves, also."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So this may be a problem in this case. The thing about brain washing is not at all important. The important thing is if they look into our financial...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our BBT trust...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That by the sales of, sales proceeds, we 50% printing expansion, temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is religion. That is clearly written there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how they can check it? We are selling books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I don't think that in, in the end they will not be able to do anything but for some time they can give us some trouble, harass us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have got already experience what is to be done, suggest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, we have to make a presentation of our movement properly, just like Tamāla suggested in the letter. Prominent persons, they have to speak on our behalf. And of course, the books must be in order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another thing, that all the Indians in Europe and America, they should sign that this Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Movement is genuine religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly here also, all the Kṛṣṇa conscious persons especially here in Vṛndāvana, all the goswamis, they should be approached that this is the genuine Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Perhaps we could even get statement from some of the favorable Indian ministers in the government? Just like this Home Minister and Tarun Kanti Ghosh in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That would be very weighty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So do like that, that this is genuine, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is genuine, cultural and religious movement. This should be taken from all prominent persons and sent there. And the copies of the standing order for all the universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The order forms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Original orders, that should be copied and sent. This arrangement, ask them all over India and beside that we have recently got a testimony of one University authorities, just like one Goswami from Calcutta University and many others they have got. These copies should be sent immediately. We can approach even the chief justice of Allahabad high-court, he came here, the minister here, the governor of Punjab, he came to see me, the governor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Andhra Pradesh government also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Andhra Pradesh, chief minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Immediately (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Minister, Vṛndāvana. Collect all these and send it that this is a genuine movement because it is great cultural movement. Therefore, Swami Bhaktivedanta wanted to give it to Europe who are in the darkness. So anyway, now they are feeling the action of the medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (laughs) Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) So many big, big sign boards, "Kṛṣṇa is coming." "Here is Kṛṣṇa." (sounds of pages being turned) "Here is Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, every heading has a "Kṛṣṇa" written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Here is Kṛṣṇa." That I... That is our trap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, the subject matter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will, that will help us in selling <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Books.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "What is this nonsense Kṛṣṇa, let us see." It is not in our disfavor, it is in favor. (chuckles) But still we have to defend. So as I suggested you collect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And from Vṛndāvana you can have signature from anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. All the <span class="Italic">Gosvāmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That Atul Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atul Kṛṣṇa, yes. Anyone will sign for Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is genuine India cultural religious movement. They have got doubt: "Whether it is bona fide religion?" Yes it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, you see the process of chanting, it is not common practice and they think it is a kind of inducement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is kind of brainwash process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brainwash? No, it is heart wash. (laughter) We can send this, "It is not brainwash," that "it is heartwash." Of course brain and heart practically same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Mm. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our temple, where many people come. Our Māyāpura temple, Hyderabad temple, it is not only in Europe or America, in India in our temples, south India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is genuine religious cult. You have to send all these people. Now note down and do all these things and send it. I can suggest. (noise in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It is disturbing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is some commotion all over there. [break] ...our child is lost altogether...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there (indistinct) who go (indistinct) they're not lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They come back again. But here (chuckles) Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement, one who comes, he'll be lost. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no hope of their coming. And Gargamuni's father tried so much to get him back. Then he became hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was pet child of his father and mother and practically they closed their factory and everything. They become, they divorced and (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Collapse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Collapse. I sent Gargamuni, go and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I remember he went home for sometime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> To try get into that business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He was detected though because he wouldn't eat meat. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He tried his best, his father. Then his father (accepted), "This child is lost."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This term brainwash, it comes from the Korean war and the Vietnamese war. They would, if they would capture a prisoner especially if he was an officer, high ranking officer, they had some methods of what they say brainwash to turn his mind so that he would accept the enemy view point. And as this happened to a person it was considered to be very, very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Great victory for the enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Great victory for the enemy. Just like because a high ranking officer in the army was captured by the enemy, then they would brainwash him. They had this, some process...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Pakistani they kill all brain, in Bangladesh. Anyone who worked in high profession like businessman, they caught shut down. It was worse to kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because everywhere the big men they guide the nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. People are very much afraid of this idea of being brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They think that their minds can be changed without them knowing about it, so it scares them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For me it is better to remain in Vṛndāvana or die. (laughter) Hm. Because they may be very envious, "Here is the man who is behind all this." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. In Germany, this one man he wrote that this movement is very dangerous, because these boys and girls who have come to this movement, they completely, they make themselves completely subservient to the dictation of one man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What ever the man will say, they will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charmistic? What is called? Charmistic Guru? He has said Dr. ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charismatic. (laughs) Yes, what is that charismatic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Charisma means a person who has a very strong attraction, he attracts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has said, actually our whole movement is going on on this. Everyone is carrying the charismatic, (laughs) all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, they know there's something different about our movement, I mean from any other. Everybody who sees the devotees for the first time, they immediately know these people are completely different from anyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir, yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> this is the Vedic principle of our movement. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir, yathā deve tathā gurau.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Have faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To respect and love the spiritual master as God. Therefore it is brainwash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This is the strength of our movement, faith in the guru and <span class="Italic">śāstra</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And everyone is writing, let them write that. So they see that, "Why this one man is so respectfully accepted, it is brainwash."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may sometimes give me trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, generally it happens like that. If someone becomes very prominent, then they want to remove him. This is the tendency in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, because the demons, they think anyone who will allow themselves to become the servant of someone else, then they think he has got very weak character. Then they accuse the person who is in charge of manipulating that person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like there are so many men now, they are against this Sai Baba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sai Baba is actually doing that brainwash. But they don't think of... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, because people cannot discriminate. They have no power to discriminate. They group us with all these other bogus people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that happened when Caitanya Mahāprabhu was being praised by the Nawab. They were asking about Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "What is the position of this man that so many people are following him?" So, Sanātana Goswami, who was very bright, took it as a warning and asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu that you leave this place as soon as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not afraid, but He, as usual, He left that place. But Sanātana Goswami, at that time minister...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He could understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He took advice, the Nawab was so serious about Him. A Mohammedan may do something. So he said, "It is not good to stay here. You should go away." They decided that we shall go now with Him but in the meantime let Him go. Because there were parts of India, Mohammedan influence, especially Bengal was Mohammedan kingdom. So this was warning. Then he told the Nawab that, "He is a beggar. Why do you think of him as serious man? He is beggar. Some people follow him, not many." So he said. "Don't try to mislead me. I know. He's not beggar, He's God. Otherwise how so many people are following Him?" The Nawab he said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "He's not ordinary man. Don't say that He's beggar,' he said. (laughs) Nobody follows a beggar like that, that is it. After all he was king, he had some brain. (laughs) So he wanted to brainwash, "Don't think of Him very seriously. A beggar. Some people, sentimental." "No, don't say like that. A beggar is never followed by so many men."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The same thing happened to Jesus. Because so many people would follow him the government became very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That what do you call it? Crucified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was becoming very popular. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And at least according to Bible, it appeared that the Jewish priests, they went to the governor or the chief man at that time, and they demanded that he has to do something about this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have proposed it. That Houston politician, "It is spreading like epidemic." Hm? Come. "It is spreading like epidemic. Something must be done." Otherwise one day they'll capture our government." That's a fact. If so many young men join this movement, they will vote. Because your country is democratic. (conchshell blows) Do this what I suggested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah. You see them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) [break] "What is this pressure?" "Sir is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (laughter) And very bad." Some day somebody says, "No it is good." (laughter) But Kṛṣṇa pressure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That pressure is being felt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Otherwise who cares for whom? There are so many things. Here also, they are feeling the pressure, the so-called swamis, yogis, Gosvāmīs, religious groups, Māyāvādīs...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Communists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Communists, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Communists. That is our success. Everyone is now feeling the pressure. (Bengali) and they are talking (Bengali). In such a short time, so much money, so much expansion, so many devotees, what is this? That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Like Vāmanadeva expanded His foot and He covered the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> First people thought, "Oh these are crazy fellows," and now suddenly they are everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Almost all of them, doctor, who have spoken. You have read that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, I have read. All respectable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian and American, all learned scholars, they have spoken. Where is that statement? And Doctor Saligram, he has spoken very nice. Where is that? Doctor Saligram, Indian Professor, anthropology or something like that. So now better to see the movement from behind, who is that man behind it? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Now they're looking for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That British government said, "Gandhi in jail is more dangerous than he is free." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> These are the statements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Dr. Saligram?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, Dr. Saligram Sukla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Education: he graduated from the University of Cambridge and a B.A. in classical languages 1962. Graduated from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York in Tibetan linguists and he has a Ph.D. in linguistics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cambridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He has several, he has several books out. He was born in India in a traditional <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, he learned Sanskrit at the age of 10, and his knowledge of the Hindu scriptures written in Sanskrit is very profound. He has committed to memory the entire <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-Gītā</span> scripture and one fourth of the <span class="Italic">Ṛg Veda</span>. He himself is a worshiper of Kṛṣṇa. His teachings is a way of life and he is extremely competent to judge whether the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is authentic and bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He came to see you in Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So this is his statement. There are 18 chapters in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, 18 thousand verses in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and several hundred verses in the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span>. These are the literary works which form the foundation of Indian culture and religion. They are all in Sanskrit. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement has transcribed these texts, has translated them, and has explained their essence in English. From Sanskrit into English. One is an ancient classical language and the other a foreign language, a difficult task indeed. I have state... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahman means unlimited happiness. <span class="Italic">Ananta brahma-saukyam ananta suddhyed sattvam yasmād suddhyed satya.</span> You purify your existence and you are hankering after happiness, you get the unlimited, greatest happiness, <span class="Italic">yasmād brahma-saukyam anantam.</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So Dr. Allen Gerson says, "I am here today as a citizen who dislikes injustice, as a person who's own people, because of their religious beliefs, are being persecuted repeatedly, and as a scientist who knows how ignorance can turn the normal rationality of people into blind hatred." (aside:) He's Jewish. "As a citizen I can see a great injustice perpetrated here. Several people, all of legal age, have chosen a lifestyle which, because it differs in form from our lifestyle, has been viewed by their families as unacceptable. These families with honest but misguided intentions have had their children removed from the Hare Kṛṣṇa Temple and have attempted to reprogram them to the behavior and attitudes of society at large. The reprogramming obviously did not work and their children returned to the movement, thus angering and frustrating their parents. Not being able to understand the wishes of their children, or their behavior, or their motivation for returning, and needing to blame someone they effected through devious means to have 2 members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has used very nice strong words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm. "They effected through devious means to have 2 members of the New York Hare Kṛṣṇa centers to be arrested. Therein lies the infection(?) of the injustice. To compound it, a judge and a grand jury agreed with their charges of unlawful imprisonment and brainwashing, a charge which is unheard of to my knowledge in civil legal proceedings, and ordered the devotees to be jailed. As a citizen I am appalled by the over-reaction, the lack of understanding, and the hate that finds wrongdoing, not only by the people that make the charges but by the court as well."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He says the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That this charge is unheard of in the legal history, brainwashing, and what was it? Brainwashing what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That there was never such a charge in the history of law, someone who's been brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (continues reading) "As a person who's own people have been persecuted for their own beliefs I can sympathize with any..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can charge anyone, brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means anybody who is doing anything is being brainwashed. (indistinct) brainwashing. (continues reading) "The fault of this religion differs from our..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are charges? (laughter) I'm controlling your mind charges. No you are controlling mine. These are the charges. (chuckles) He's controlling his mind. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (continues reading) "The fault of this religion differs from our western thought. Throughout history the group tried to find God through beliefs other than those which were held by the majority, and if those beliefs were very different from the majority's, such beliefs were almost always..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)...their arguments so strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) ...debaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, and their theories were that because... Because they are, they have accepted your Divine Grace as the absolute authority, that they will do anything that you say and therefore these people are very dangerous. They don't care for anything. They're not interested in the normal standards and goals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charmistic, charmistic, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Charismatic. There is, they usually use this word to describe a person who attracts people, but no one can understand why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they cannot explain, brainwash, mind control, charismatic, like that they use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, he says that here, because of their own ignorance then they find fault. He goes on: "From this misunderstanding came fear then hatred and from hatred grew injustices and often atrocities. An injustice is now being perpetrated through ignorance. Are atrocities far off? This may sound like an overstatement, but for those who say, 'It can't happen here,' it already has, such as to the American Indians and to our people (of) Japanese descendant. The time to stop such action is at the beginning, now. The way to stop it is to replace ignorance with knowledge, and hatred with understanding. Sometimes people stand off at a distance and look at another person's belief and laugh at them or fear them. But as they get closer, they may come to understand how similar the observer's beliefs may be to their own beliefs. As a scientist, a psychologist, I have tried to learn about and understand the Hare Kṛṣṇa people. For nearly a year I have spent hours each week, talking with, reading about, and testing members of the movement. I have been to their temples in this country and in Europe. I have eaten in their homes and I have been to their children's schools. What I have found is a group of people trying to find God and live as closely to the way that He would like them to live. There is no place in their lives for immorality, for cruelty to other people or animals, for artificial stimulants or harmful chemicals such as alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. At first glance their approach to God may seem alien to us with their different dress, the incense, and the many statues and their unique ceremonies, but a closer look reveals similarities to our religious practices that are just the same. In Catholicism we find the holy water, chanting on the rosary, statues of saints and incense. And in Judaism we find the blowing of the <span class="Italic">shofar.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they say, the cow's urine, they are forcing to eat. (laughter) (Bengali) ...that they are forcing the devotees to drink cow's urine. (laughter) These are the charges: brainwash, mind control, forcing cow's urine to drink. (laughter) How clever they are to find out some fictitious faults.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You see, you see they have, they put these 2 boys in a mental institution. Yes. When they can't... This is what happens in these countries. When they can't find any legal point, they can put the person into a mental institution to be examined. The premise is that if we find that a person is drinking cow's urine, we may think he must be crazy, because we have never heard of such a thing. So in this way they can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Commit them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, they commit them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Forcibly they just put them into a mental institution where they're observed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Where they... That observation, so-called observation means that they give them all kinds of drugs which make them very dopey and then they influence them to try to become normal again, what they think is normal. Sometimes they give them electric shocks which ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the lunatic asylum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, which leaves them in a very shocked condition and then they, what they call reprogram them. That means they brainwash them back into another way, to another style of life, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So it goes on, (continues reading) "In Judaism we find the blowing of the <span class="Italic">shofar,</span> or ram's horn, and in the orthodox synagogue there is separation of men and women. Differences of dress are expressed amongst orthodox Jews and amongst various Christian orders. Our own Pilgrim ancestors differed in dress form the popish gentry of their time. I have studied and tested the Hare Kṛṣṇa people and have not found them to be weird or insane, only different form the mainstream. Like any other evangelical or proselytizing religion, their converts could only become converts if they choose to believe. For example, no one can drag a person to a Baptist Church and brainwash him into taking God into his heart, he has to want to accept willingly. No one is ever held against their will by the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. I have never seen it, nor have my colleagues ever seen it. In examining the various members of this religion, I have not found one who appears to be brainwashed or dopey like. In fact their mental health and normality astounds me. If you cannot accept Kṛṣṇa, God, they will sympathize with you and hope that you will eventually find Him and will wish you well as you go on your way. There have been devotees who have left the movement and have said negative things about it, but the sour grapes syndrome is not unusual for dropouts anyway. I wonder how many West Point dropouts vilify the Army, or how many Seminary drop outs leave and disdain their religion? After a rational person spends time with the Hare Kṛṣṇa people and learns to understand them, he could never believe them to be guilty of the charges which have been made here in New York recently."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, positive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And then this is Dr. Stillson Judah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's a graduate from University of Washington, majoring in oriental studies, graduate from University of California with a Ph.D in Sanskrit and Indian Languages, and he received an honorary degree from Chapman College, Southern California. And he has various posts as professor of history of religion. etc....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written about us, the big book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big book. Bring that, bring that book. After 5 years scrutinizingly studying, statistics, graphics, and he has put my picture in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Looks like your book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Dr. Stillson Judah says, "The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement and more formally the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, ISKCON, is a western representation of an important Hindu sect, Vaisnavism."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says, "Important Hindu sect." How they can say whether it is a genuine? Important, not only genuine but important, Vaisnavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm. (continues reading) "...whose worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, in one of His many forms is one of the most important religions of India. The American devotees of ISKCON worship Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Being, the highest Personality of Godhead, whose worship according to the archaeological and epigraphic evidence, is pre-Christian in origin, as found in India's early sacred texts, the <span class="Italic">Ṛg Veda, Atharva Veda,</span> etc. The detailed history of Kṛṣṇa's incarnation is found in the religious text of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Purāṇa,</span> and the philosophical basis of the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement is found in India's most sacred book the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. These sacred texts and others have been translated and commented upon by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda and are being studied today in many major universities across the United States. The particular form of Vaisnavism of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement dates from Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one of India's saints born in 1486 A.D. in Nadia, India. His immediate followers organized this philosophy in a number of Sanskrit texts, and His religious practices such as chanting and dancing are most authentically represented in America by the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees according to this tradition. Lord Caitanya, worshiped as the last incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, initiated a disciplic succession. In the mid-19th century, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura appeared in this spiritual lineage. Soon afterwards, his son Bhaktisiddhānta, Sarasvatī became the spiritual master of India's Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, and his most prominent student was Śrīla Prabhupāda. It was at Bhaktisiddhānta's command that Śrīla Prabhupāda later came to America to bring the teachings and practices of Caitanya to the West. My study of these American devotees, which I have pursued since 1968, was published in my book, <span class="Italic">Hare Krishna and the Counter-culture,</span> published by John Wiley and Sons in 1974, New York. The sociological data revealed through a detailed questionnaire and many hours of taped interviews, indicates that many of the devotees had been influenced by the hippie culture of the 1960's. However, after they joined the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, their lives became completely changed from a life of drugs, illicit sex, and violence to one of dedication to a spiritual discipline and morality and to helping others in their search for happiness. In this period of rapid social and cultural change..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the fact, in many cases. So many drunkards, so many violence... This is... (name witheld)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (name witheld).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big drunkard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (name witheld). Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (continues reading) "In this period of rapid social and cultural change, this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is giving many of our youths new meaning to their lives without which many would have remained alienated, disenchanted, irresponsible citizens." This is a letter that was written by one devotee, Sravanananda Das, by his mother. Sravanananda is here in India. Should I read this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can read it, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> My son Daniel, Sravananda Das, entered the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement almost 5 years ago. The only request that he made of me and my husband was that we read about the Hare Kṛṣṇa philosophy and try to understand his new way of life. My husband and I have read everything we could find about the movement and the philosophy. We have visited the Hare Kṛṣṇa Centers in Philadelphia and New York frequently, always speaking to the devotees and having our questions answered. Evidently these youths feel a revulsion towards the sense gratification of forbidden permissive values of our society. When I see how happy the devotees are..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Haṁsadūta, Haṁsadūta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Haṁsadūta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Ceylon is educated and if they are receiving, why not open a branch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (continues reading) "He recently returned home after almost 3 years in India. My husband and I could see the awareness and maturity in him gained from his experiences in working with the Indian people. He learned first-hand about a different culture and it certainly has enriched his life. In our minds we can compare our son's life to the life of a Catholic monk or a religious Jew of the Hasidic sect. Do I think that my son is brainwashed? I can best answer this by answering the question, is our whole society not being brainwashed daily by the advertisement media? Liquor, smoking, pornographic movies and literature and which is worse? And what about the children who are being educated by the violence and killing on T.V.? I prefer that my son is devoting his life to the love of God and the service of humanity, a rare endeavor in this age. Since I know that my son has voluntarily chosen the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement to exercise these rights and that he can leave it whenever he wishes I cannot see how the term 'brainwashing' can be applicable to this movement. I sincerely believe from my contacts with many devotees that they are happy and have found fulfillment by loving and serving Lord Kṛṣṇa, God. This may not be my wish for my life but my son has chosen it for his, and I whole heartedly respect it."</div>
