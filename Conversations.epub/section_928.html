<div class="Purp-para">(loud tape of Prabhupāda, "Hare Krishna Happening" Album, chanting in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> ...and how we danced at the end? You were dancing with <span class="Italic">karatālas</span> when you were listening to the record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we have got our own studio. We also do. What is the name, Allen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Ginsberg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Oh, Coleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Coleman, yes. Last time in India, he gave me twenty-five thousand rupees. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> He did?! Wow, twenty-five thousand! He still has the original tape of this record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him now do. He wanted to pay me something, but he never paid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I sent Kṛṣṇa-kānti, he made a, recorded this in South Africa and printed it. It's not actually legal, but we did it because we didn't think it would... This is the most wonderful record for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness because you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. So pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Originally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People can more appreciate Hare Kṛṣṇa than these <span class="Italic">bhajanas,</span> because they do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhajana,</span> they do... [break] ...Brahmānanda, you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Brahmānanda, yes, he's singing. Satsvarūpa. Hayagrīva was there also, and Jadurāṇī was there. We were playing all kinds of instruments, all kinds of things. We were playing bells and sticks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kīrtanānanda was playing <span class="Italic">sitar.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I was playing a broken <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It was wood. Was it wooden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think they had that at the New Vrindaban farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We had borrowed it from an Indian man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was a little one-sided drum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, it was a big, two-sided wooden drum. That was another drum. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> This record, yes. October, November. November or December, near Christmas. Acyutānanda was there also. (walk)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> This is the historical building where they have the information about what this place used to be, how it used to function.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> When it would fill up, then they'd let the boat down inside, from one level down to the next, on down. They were small barges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is river?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Potomac River.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I was going to ask that this soul, the nature of the soul, we find that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, no, the soul, the <span class="Italic">ātmā, jīva.</span> We get a description that the soul, the size of a soul is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. We were just discussing whether does this imply that it can be measured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the measurement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we are claiming that it is nonphysical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nonphysical, that doesn't mean it has no measurement. It has measurement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So measurement... Actually, Sadāputa calculated from how much the size is. Now from electron microscope, actually we can get an idea about the tip of the hair, how much it is. Now you divide it by one ten-thousandth part, so it (will) come out the size of the soul is about two angstroms, by calculation like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two atoms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, angstroms. Angstrom is the smallest scale that science can imagine. It is smaller even than the hydrogen atom. So actually it is atomic, it is very small in size.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we were wondering whether that is reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reasonable? Yes. It is given in <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa,</span> authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It's just that this one ten-thousandth tip of hair has no material quality. It is nonphysical but still can be measured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonphysical... Just like axiomatic truth point has no length, no breadth, but it has length and breadth. You cannot measure it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But does this not imply-one ten-thousandth the size-does that not imply measurement, that it can be measured?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, measurement, measurement is there. This is closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Yes, this is the service road, but up here is a very nice way to look at the waterfall. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya<br class="calibre2"/>śatadhā kalpitasya ca<br class="calibre2"/>bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sa cānantyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">In the microbe there is soul. If it is not so small, how in the microbe there can be soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, it is small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the falls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Manmade waterfalls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manmade?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> This is the dam part. The other part, this is manmade dam here. There's other parts where it flows freely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Airplanes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Little flies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can manufacture airplanes like this with pilot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they can manufacture bigger ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What will be the technique to attract the Bengali educational class? To attract the Bengalis who are educated, what technique will be most effective?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But it seems to me they are not so much interested. There was a man who came from Calcutta about two months ago, a Bengali, and in fact we were class friends in Calcutta when I was studying in Calcutta. And I discussed this problem with him, why so-called Bengali intellectuals are not attracted to our movement. And his answer was that the Caitanya movement was mostly for less intellectuals. For those who are educated, they want to be followers of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. In fact, they have a society called Vedanta Society. All the Bengalis get together...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And waste their time. The rascals waste their time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And they discuss... So I was a little mad at him, this friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the real fact is they do not want to give up meat-eating and fish-eating. Therefore they like Vivekananda. That is the real reason. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement, Vaiṣṇava, they have to give up so many things. That is the disease of the Bengalis. And Vivekananda is recognized only in Bengal. To some part, not all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> There is also a small Vedanta Society here in Washington. I had one of our Indian associates, whom I hope you will be able to meet, go there, and he said they could not even discuss the topics of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They had no conclusions, they were arguing in their own meeting, and no one had any idea what <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was, and so many technical points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The meat-eaters are the most sinful. They cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Vinā paśughnāt, nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānāt [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> They will have no access.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think there must be a fundamental mistake in their outlook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their life is a mistake, because they are sinful. Their life is a mistake, misguided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This fellow is a chemist, and actually he's very intelligent and he has read all the <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> and he has studied many thoughts on Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, we have to talk with them about this, "What is life?" Then they will talk. If they are on the bodily conception of life, they are animals, which is not. First of all, you have to talk with them on this platform, "What is life." Identification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> To me, my feeling was that they somewhat look down. They look down in their feeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Look down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They think they are superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you did not talk with him and argue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I argued.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Well, ultimately he has to accept that, our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have become less intelligent on account of their bad habits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This man, there's a Professor Mitra, he's in Emory University in Department of Sociology. They claim he's a Vedantist, and they have a group. And this Das, actually his name was Das, he told me that he has Śrīla Prabhupāda's <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is</span> and worships it, he recites every day. And he told me that he praises very much, that it's the best <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> he has seen. So although he's involved in something else, but still he's taking Śrīla Prabhupāda's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Any man who is reasonable, he'll come. If he's animal, he cannot come. That is the difference. The first charge is that anyone who is in bodily concept of life, he's animal. First of all, refute. If you are thinking that "I am this body," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am American," "I am this," "I am that," then you are animal. This is our first charge. What they will answer? What is the difference? If a dog is thinking "I am dog," and I am thinking "I am Indian" or "American," what is the difference? What is the difference between the dog and the man? That first charge should be answered. Then further questions can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So it seems to be that we need some strong preaching in Calcutta, in Bengal. We want to attract some intellectuals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are many intellectuals. Not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> My concern here, staying here in Atlanta, there are many Bengali families, but they never come to the temple. There was our life member program, and so many <span class="Italic">prabhus</span> are going to make life members, and these Bengalis, they don't even have some respect. That is why I was a little, seeing their <span class="Italic">moto</span>(?) I was a little disappointed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you will ask them not to eat meat, and that they cannot do. What are these? Crows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At our Māyāpura Candrodaya Mandira, though, <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of people are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, it is by the common people, ordinary people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are godless, they are uncommon. Educated Bengalis, they are spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. My feeling was they do not want to stop eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think that is the main reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Vivekananda says whatever you like, you can eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">yata mata tata patha.</span> They claim like this also. They follow like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spoiled. Bengalis are spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Our request is they should join and they should help us in spreading the mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are <span class="Italic">narādhamas.</span> (end)</div>
