<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He wants to help us. He has many degrees. In chemistry, in pathology, in engineering. He said if we have an institute like this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...it would be very easy to defeat Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because they claim that they are Vedantists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they have no <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> so we are in the line of Bhaktivedanta, so he said, that this is the way to counteract the so-called Māyāvādīs or Vedantists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're atheist. More than atheist. They have been described by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as more dangerous than the atheist. <span class="Italic">Vede nāmāniyā bauddha hoila nāstika, vedāśraya nāstikavāda bauddha ke ādi.</span> They take the shelter of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and preach atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say they do not accept what it is all said in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> They accept something, and they reject something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Sometimes they say that whatever they say must be supplemented from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It's contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They support the proposition that in different <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> different things are stressed, therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, you should accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the summarized <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> Or <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Or <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's a mystery, why they don't accept <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they cannot poke their nose there. Then it will be cut off. (laughter) But still they are attempting to cheat by reading <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Although, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it's somewhat easy for us to convince that <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the summary study of all the Vedic literatures, how can we take that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the summary study?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is preliminary study of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Bhagavad-gītā</span> ends, from there <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> begins. [break] Publish your book gradually in the magazine <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In the journal, by.... Step by step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Then publish in a book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That's good. Like we did with your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> one time, we made little chapter editions. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...when they mention that the trees, the trunk of the trees we'll use for clothes. Barks of trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How would they do that? Would they take the same type of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They knew how to do. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> ...question about Geology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do I know about geology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In geology, there are certain rocks, especially in the west coast, they found out that the top layer in the rock is older than the one in the bottom. Upside down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And they have several explanations, mostly based on speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything speculation. The down portion is older, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, the.... In these rocks the upper one is older according to their calculation by dating method, geological dating method and the younger one is at the bottom. First I wanted to contact our Prabhu at the, Bob.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-ṣauri:</span> Bob Cohen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, Bob Cohen our geology.... Sometime Prabhupāda had trouble with this boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In a <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We are going to contact him. So how do we explain these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How do we explain from our point of view? The upside down of the rocks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot. First of all, we do not bother for all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they are going to bring up these points, and the guru should say something. But we must know somehow how to counteract them. One point is that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can be explained, that when there is devastation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the rock...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Turn over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...roll, it was like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Catastrophism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then the whole thing would be filled up with water. So water course is very heavy. So it can turn even big, big rocks, mountains rolling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That happens when there is devastation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> At the end of Manu's day, when there is flood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> End of the day of Brahmā. End of fourteen Manus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At that time is the earth destroyed, or is it simply covered by water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Covered by water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That can explain many facts, because they're having great difficulty in finding these old fossils, in Siberia, and all these other places, they find some strange fossils, which are not supposed to be there according to their theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But if we accept this catastrophism, this can explain many facts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The rocks also have offspring, if they're living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That offspring is mouse. (laughter) There is information the rocks were flying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mountains, some mountains are flying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the..., cut off their wings. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...it's true that people are getting disease and sicknesses as the result of their past activities, pious or sinful. Why is it that it appears that when there is a flu many people are inflicted with that flu? Practically everyone, indiscriminately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All of them? Hm. "Birds of the same feather, flock together, see."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (laughs) What about when it happens amongst the community of devotees or some, hepatitis, or malaria, or something of that nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? It is also past sins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Purification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well the materialists would say, "You're just accepting it that way. The reality is that you're becoming sick just like anyone else."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The scientist or materialist will say, "You're just becoming sick like anyone else, but you're saying it's just, that you're becoming purified."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. What you have to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a fact though, when people are suffering they're neutralizing their sinful reactions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is the wrong there? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...becoming purified from this suffering then why isn't it when we're sick, why is it that we forget Kṛṣṇa, we become disgusted, and after we are sick we don't feel any more advanced than before? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...purified, you will not be sick. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...the difference between the materialist and the transcendentalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Materialist always thinks that they will try to overcome the laws of nature, and when the laws of nature catch over...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śudhyeta satya</span> (?) Sometimes the spiritual master has to suffer for the sinful activities of his disciples. [break] ...this suffering is short cut. For the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> it would have been a huge suffering but devotee is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So then if he is sincere, then he should not be so sick in due time, his health should be good if he's practicing. If a devotee is practicing principles, then he should become healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, you cannot avoid sickness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, but I mean, overall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Devotees are generally healthier than <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Once there was this <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> he used to complain to you about how sick he was all the time, and you said, "Are you not <span class="Italic">brahmacārī?</span> Are you not following the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> principles?" Did you imply that if he were doing it sincerely he would not be so sick all the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Devotee is sick, and he also knows that this is the mercy of the Lord so he doesn't complain in its real sense but the material body is bound to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...you are convinced that you are not this body then there is no suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, that's the clue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you identify with the body, then you suffer. [break] ...body is damaged, you are not damaged, but because you have got attachment for the motor car, you suffer. [break] ...song by Narottama Dāsa Ṭhākura, <span class="Italic">yāhā smṛti nāhi yār, saṁsāra-bandhana kahata.</span> One who has forgotten that he is this body, he has no suffering. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Then, if Sanātana Gosvāmī had all those infections in his body, and Lord Caitanya embrace him, he felt so distressed and so lowly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, so (this) instructs us that even Sanātana Gosvāmī had to suffer. What you are nonsense. You should not be sorry for suffering. That is the instruction. Why you are trying to avoid suffering? That is the instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī, he accepted this sickness as a result of his own sinful past activities, he was so humble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So we should follow that example, and accept like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the instruction. <span class="Italic">Tat te 'nukampām [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span> 10.14.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> "It is Your mercy, my Lord, that I would have suffered a hundred times more than this, You are giving me little suffering." That is devotee's view. That "I am so sinful, I would have suffered hundred times more than what I am suffering. But You are so kind that You are giving me little suffering and adjusting that (indistinct)." [break] ...thinks like that, for him, back to home back to Godhead is guaranteed. That is the <span class="Italic">bhagavata-dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">Muktipadeśa dayābhāk.</span> One who lives like that, doesn't care for suffering, goes on with his duty. That person is sure to go back to home, back to Godhead. Just like a son is sure to inherit the father's property. <span class="Italic">Dayābhāk,</span> this word is used. <span class="Italic">Muktipadeśa dayābhāk.</span> Literally, heritage. Ha? What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Inheritance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inheritance, yes. Legally inheritance. [break] ...we're afraid of suffering. Let there be so many, what is that? Let me do my duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From these sufferings actually we know that this material world is full of misery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So how to get out this misery that is the point, next step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And those who know (indistinct), he is not hankering after how to get out of the (indistinct). They do not care for (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Isn't it in the sense the material concept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...have to cultivate this tolerance, not only a physical pain, but sometimes other pains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena.</span> Tolerance when they (indistinct), everyone is (indistinct), he doesn't (indistinct). <span class="Italic">Taror api sahiṣṇunā</span>. You have to learn these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Lord Caitanya says if we are tolerant then we can chant the holy name of the Lord purely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the scientists, they'll laugh at us, and they'll say, "we are helping to..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we laugh at us, so what is the wrong? We laugh at them. We tell them. So that struggle will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> But we will laugh last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No, they'll say, "You're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, but I can give you this pill and I'll take away your pain," or, "I can give you this medicine and correct your disease. You're chanting, but I am not seeing a practical result."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I will say, "because I'm chanting you, you are my servant, you have brought the pill. (laughter) Because I am chanting, therefore Kṛṣṇa has sent the pill through you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> "You're simply working."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "You're simply working as my servant, that's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They can make.... We'll chant and dance and they can make the car to take us on <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> make the pills so we can keep healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The best pill is this <span class="Italic">hari-nāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you are the great physician. Everyone should come under your treatment. They're taking this <span class="Italic">hari-nāma</span> as a bitter pill. But we are tasting it now, and after chanting and chanting, we're tasting, it's becoming sweeter and sweeter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. This is all of us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh, yes. (end)</div>
