<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...production of is external. <span class="Italic">Bahir-aṅga-śakti.</span> But the <span class="Italic">śakti,</span> the energy, is coming from the Supreme. Just like here we find this place is shadow and that place is sunshine. Both these places are due to the sun. When there is no sun there is no such distinction that "This is shining, sunny, and this is shadow." So this distinction is there so long we do not know the real source. But if we know the real source, we can understand that this distinction is temporary. Actually the energy is coming from the Supreme. So shadow has come from Supreme, and light has also come from the Supreme. So there is no distinction, ultimately. Just like earring, golden, manufactured from gold, and gold which is not manufactured. So this distinction-manufactured or not manufactured, secondary. But really the earring is also gold, and the lump of gold is also gold. So why should we say that earring is false? It is also gold. In relationship with the supreme source, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> there is no such distinction. In another place, while Vyāsadeva was instructed by Nārada, he said, <span class="Italic">idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaro.</span> This <span class="Italic">viśva,</span> the <span class="Italic">virāṭ-rūpa,</span> is also Bhagavān, but it appears different from Him. Just like the shadow appears different from the sunshine, but actually, taking the central point of emanation, it is different manifestation. That's all. Tree-there are so many varieties. One is trunk, one is branch, one is twig, one is leaf, one is.... So the varieties are there, but the tree is one, the root. So ultimately there is no variety, only one. <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> The difference is the Māyāvādīs, they abruptly say everything is one. Not everything is one. The trunk is not one with the leaf, but ultimately because the root is the cause, so there is no difference between the trunk and the leaf. This is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda</span> philosophy, simultaneously one and different. On the whole, everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br class="calibre2"/>mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Why should we think this world is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> when it is created by God? Does God create anything false? No. When it is created by God.... When we think that "I create some business, some factory, that is my pleasure," but if somebody else thinks it, it is for his pleasure, that is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> The world is created by God, He has got some motive, so if the world, cosmic manifestation, is utilized for His purpose, then it is spiritual. Otherwise, it is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In the Seventh Canto, second volume, the first chapter in that volume, Prahlāda Mahārāja is talking how the studying of the three <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is external and it includes knowledge though, of education and self-realization, but he considers it material because it is external study of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> I don't understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything external is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Self-realization is included in that list of education and self-realization and other items.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, self-realization, simply understanding "I am not this matter," is also external because there is chance of falldown. But when you are actually engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, that is positive platform of self-realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Just like the <span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">]. Brahmeti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different stages of self-realization. (pause) Today there is no wind at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Sometimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we explain that our activities are spiritual, what we are doing is spiritual.... Just like we say the quality of the tape recorder becomes spiritualized when it's used in Kṛṣṇa's service. So the materialists, they don't understand. They say "Well, the tape recorder will also break, the tapes will also be burned up sometimes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. It will go to Kṛṣṇa. Breaking, where it will go? Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> They say the chemicals again become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That chemical, where it will go? <span class="Italic">Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante yasmin saṁviśanti.</span> Everything is created from Kṛṣṇa, again it returns to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Then they say then we needn't play Kṛṣṇa conscious music. We might as well play rock and roll if it is going back to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> This is meant for Kṛṣṇa's service. As soon as you do anything else, then it is <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> is also Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">māyā. Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">. Māyā</span> is also Kṛṣṇa's. But under <span class="Italic">māyā</span> we suffer; under Kṛṣṇa we enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> So if we engage everything here in Kṛṣṇa's service, then the atmosphere will change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> They can notice the change in the atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real atmosphere. <span class="Italic">Sva-rūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ. Mukti</span> means to stay in the original form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I've heard that you use the example that spirit has form and therefore the body also has similar form, just as a hand has a form in a glove, it's the hand's similar form. So how can we understand that the trees have a certain form? That..., is there spirit in the form of a tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Then how do we explain the transmigration of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This outward is a form. What is the difficulty? Describe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just as this human body has a human form, we say that because this body has a form, the soul also must have form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Talking about the transmigration then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just as the glove has a certain form because the hand is shaped like that, the material body of a human has that form because the spirit is in that form? And the tree has that form because the spirit is in that form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here difficulty is that the form is fixed up. That is not.... Just like Kṛṣṇa appears in so many forms, everything is spiritual. So what do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So the form in the spiritual sky is not absolute either? We can take different forms in the spiritual sky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are also many forms, but all of them are spiritual. The Vṛndāvana. There is tree, there is Yamunā water, there is land, there is cow, there is calf, there is <span class="Italic">gopas,</span> <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they are all spiritual. Just like from earth you make many forms, but they are earth. You make pots, you make dolls, but they are all earth. Similarly, spiritual world, there are many forms, they are all spiritual. What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Does that form ever change? That form changes also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Kṛṣṇa is young and then He's a little older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally, it does not change, if one likes this type of form. <span class="Italic">Śānta, dāsya, sākhya, vātsalya, mādhurya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> That change is available to anyone to progress from <span class="Italic">śānta</span> to <span class="Italic">dāsya</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That change is not material change. The spiritual bliss is there, either in this form or that form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that if we serve Kṛṣṇa we will enjoy, and if we serve <span class="Italic">māyā</span> then we suffer. How can we get over our desire to serve <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and enjoy separately from Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Says in the material world when we try to enjoy we suffer. When we try to enjoy we suffer? Then how will we get over our desire? And when we serve Kṛṣṇa we become happy. But how will we get over our desire to serve <span class="Italic">māyā</span>? The attachment is strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He says how will we get over the desire to serve <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> to try to enjoy ourselves in this material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Serve Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It says here that <span class="Italic">yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> One obtaining this actual service of Kṛṣṇa, when one tastes the service of Kṛṣṇa, then he sees any other gain, he does not consider anything else. "Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain." So when you actually taste the service of Kṛṣṇa, then you won't consider anything else to be worthy of your effort. But when we do think something else to be worthy of our effort then it means that we haven't, we're not becoming advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We're not developed. We should try to develop to that point. We have to develop. Prabhupāda says this is the test of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that you will not want to depart from Kṛṣṇa consciousness to enjoy himself in material nature. And when one still wants to do that, that means he hasn't advanced to that point of stability in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vrata,</span> who's completely fixed in his service. <span class="Italic">Avasthitiḥ. Yatra sthito na calati.</span> When one is situated there, he doesn't depart from there, he doesn't want to go out from there. So we have to reach that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if at this platform we are not yet..., we are still desiring to depart from Kṛṣṇa's service and enjoy, then we are not, we have not yet tasted devotional service, what is it that we have tasted that is keeping us temporarily connected to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the Vedic injunction: You keep yourself connected with Kṛṣṇa, then you will develop the taste. Just like a jaundice patient does not taste sugar as sweet, but if he continues to take sugar candy, then he will have the real taste for sugar candy, sweet, not bitter. So he has to continue to eat sugar candy continually. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇam, kīrtanam.</span> Then he'll have the taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> But the patient must be intelligent to keep.... Even though he does not want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Patient is always rascal fool. You cannot expect him to be intelligent. He must agree to the physician's directions. That is intelligence. He must know that he's diseased, he must follow the instruction of the physician. That much will help him. Unless one is rascal, he does not fall sick. As soon as you violate the hygienic principles, you become sick. All commit sinful activities on account of ignorance. So therefore the best advancement of civilization is not to open hospitals, but to give them a lesson that they may not fall sick and go to hospital. That is real...But they do not know. They keep the mass of people in ignorance, they fall sick and they come to hospital and number of hospitals increase, they think it is advancement. This is their idea. So even the Christians, religious persons, they also open hospital to give relief to the patient. So that is not the program. The program is why he should fall sick and come to the hospital? Precaution is better than cure. One comes to the hospital for cure, but why not take the precaution so that he may not have to come to the hospital for cure? That is Vedic civilization. They have different prescribed rules and regulations so that a person may not fall sick. The modern idea is that "Let them fall sick; we have got hospitals and treat them, and they'll be cured." But he is cured, again he falls sick. That is going on. They have no program for precaution. They have program for cure. But actually, precaution is better than cure. We are taking precaution. The other fools, rascals, they are thinking, "What these people are doing? They are (indistinct) to have no this program, that," according to them. Just like our Vivekananda, he prescribed, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> The same thing-hospital. We kill all animals, and the hospital patient is given the meat for improvement of the health. But he does not know that this is not curing; he is become implicated in his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> He has to be killed again, and eaten by the other animals. That he does not know. They do not accept <span class="Italic">karma-phala.</span> Eh? The result of fruitive activities, (indistinct). But you will have to accept. There is no excuse. If you contaminate some disease, you must suffer from that disease. There is no excuse. So <span class="Italic">kriya(?) karma,</span> you have to enjoy or suffer the result of <span class="Italic">karma. Karma-bandhana.</span> But when you act for Kṛṣṇa, then you are <span class="Italic">mukta. Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9]. Karma</span> must be there. If you work for Kṛṣṇa, then it is all right, and if you act for your sense gratification, then there is bondage. If you do not take education, if you remain fools and rascals, then you will suffer and create disturbance for others also. Therefore everyone must be educated, good citizens. It is good for him, good for others. (long pause) So you go on reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">sa niścayena yoktavyo<br class="calibre2"/>yogo 'nirviṇṇa-cetasā<br class="calibre2"/>saṅkalpa-prabhavān kāmāṁs<br class="calibre2"/>tyaktvā sarvān aśeṣataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>manasaivendriya-grāmaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viniyamya samantataḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Translation: "One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind." Purport: "The yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the practice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the end and pursue this course with great perseverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any delay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid practitioner. Regarding <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī says: <span class="Italic">utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt, saṅga-tyāgāt sato vṛtteḥ ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati</span> [<i class="calibre3">Upadeśāmṛta </i>3]<span class="Italic">.</span> 'The process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can be executed successfully with full-hearted enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of goodness.' As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garuḍa, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viṣṇu, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garuḍa was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garuḍa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuḍa. Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job, but if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So is there ever, for someone whose determination wavers and slackens here and there, is there ever a point where the neophyte devotee is in danger of just forgetting everything and falling, tumbling completely back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is neophyte. He should practice determination, that's all. If he cannot practice, then why should he enter into this association? Let him remain aloof. One who has entered with the determination that "I must practice," so if he cannot practice, then why this makeshow that "I belong to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. I am initiated." Why this farce? He must practice with determination that "By practicing I'll be success." That is wanted. He has no determination, why should he make a show? <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vrata. Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ. Dṛḍha-vrata,</span> that is wanted, determination. Hmm, go on. When one is determined, his success is assured. If he's not determined, then success or failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Can one develop determination gradually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why gradually? When you promise before your spiritual master that no illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating, why should you fall down? If you have no determination, why should you promise in presence of the Deity, fire, spiritual master, Vaiṣṇava? Why do you make this farce, if you have no determination? If you want to make it a farce, that depends on you. But you should not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> When we make that promise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you should not fall down, that is determination. That is gentleman's determination, that "I have given my promise. Why shall I fall down?" That is determination. "I must respect promise." That is called <span class="Italic">dṛḍha-vrata.</span> So he'll success. Where is the difficulty? There is no difficulty. But if we want to cheat, that is another thing. If we have no determination, we should not take up this life. Therefore, chance is given that "Stay with us for six months or one year, be determined. Then be initiated." If you are not determined, what is the use of false initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Sometimes this weakness seems to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Weakness there, you should rectify weakness. Why you should give any importance to weakness? Weakness is weakness. Rectify it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> This promise is the minimum determination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> This promise of following four regulative principles, chanting sixteen rounds daily, that is the minimum determination. Then, from there, he must increase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Initiation means minimum, just beginning. That is the dictionary meaning, initiation. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> there is a verse, <span class="Italic">śraddhā-śabde-viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya, kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya</span> [<span class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya </span> 22.62]<span class="Italic">.</span> Explain. You understand? <span class="Italic">Śraddhā, śabde, viśvāsa, sudṛḍha, niścaya. Kṛṣṇe, bhakti, kaile, sarva-karma, kṛta, haya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> The word <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> means faith. So by the word faith, we need firm determination or conviction, <span class="Italic">śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya. Viśvāsa</span> means faith which is <span class="Italic">sudṛḍha,</span> very..., <span class="Italic">sudṛḍha, dṛḍha</span> means firm, and <span class="Italic">sudṛḍha</span> means very firmly. <span class="Italic">Niścaya. Niścaya</span> is used here also, <span class="Italic">sa niścayena yoktavyaḥ. Yoga</span> is to be engaged in, applied with firm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith, <span class="Italic">niścaya</span> means conviction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Conviction. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇe</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti kaile</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva kṛta-karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-karma kṛta haya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-karma kṛta haya.</span> And if one engages, if one performs service to Kṛṣṇa, then everything else becomes accomplished. Everything else becomes accomplished. If one renders service to Kṛṣṇa, then automatically everything else, one has no obligations to the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, why Kṛṣṇa will say <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]? Because by that action everything will be done. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam,</span> that means He is cheating? There are so many other occupations, say <span class="Italic">veda-dharma, samāja-dharma, brāhmaṇa-dharma, kṣatriya-dharma,</span> medical <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> lawyer <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> You can manufacture so many occupations. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means occupational duty. But if you take only one occupational duty, to serve Kṛṣṇa, all things will be included. <span class="Italic">Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> This is instruction. So to accept this principle means firm determination, firm conviction: "Yes, if I serve Kṛṣṇa, then all my other duties will be automatically done." This is firm conviction. "By one stroke, I'll kill so many birds."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛtti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī says <span class="Italic">bhajana-kriyā</span> and then <span class="Italic">anārtha-nivṛtti.</span> Then all the unwanted things go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, beginning with <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya.</span> So <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> beginning is <span class="Italic">ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅga bhajana-kriyā anartha-nivṛttiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]<span class="Italic">.</span> The material world means simply creating unnecessary duties. Simply <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> Any material activities, you take, analyze, it is simply useless. Therefore we have called <span class="Italic">anartha. Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.</span> Take for example we say no meat-eating. So what is the difficulty there? I have seen in the airplane, they eat meat, a little piece, not a lump. But because everyone is eating little, little, we require huge number of slaughterhouses. But if one decides, "I have got so many preparations to eat, so why shall I eat little meat?" (indistinct) I shall forego. Immediately he is saved from so many sinful activities. It is not that he will die if he does not eat a little piece of meat, he will die. He'll not die. We are not dying, and we don't take. So similarly everyone, without eating meat, he can live very nicely. In the whole principle, there is no difficulty. So on this principle this whole world is merged into sinful activity. (Sanskrit), unnecessary. That is material position-unnecessarily creating trouble. There is no necessity. But on account of ignorance, foolish association, sinful life, more and more and more and more going on. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upagīyamānāḥ.</span> And the deed is encouraged: "Yes, you do this. Enjoy life." What is his enjoyment? If anyone sees slaughterhouse, will he enjoy? Eh? What is...? He visits a slaughterhouse, is it enjoyment? But he takes as enjoyment. (Sanskrit), unnecessary, without any meaning. Mad, just like a madman acts, without any meaning. The monkey acts without any meaning. (Sanskrit), unnecessarily creating disturbance. (Sanskrit) <span class="Italic">sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.</span> If you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then all (Sanskrit) is finished. (Sanskrit) We are no more interested in unnecessary things. Illicit sex-one side they are encouraging contraceptive method, so why they'll not stop illicit sex, then automatically there is contraceptive method? So one side there is encouraged, contraceptive method, another, unlimited, unrestricted sex. This is their civilization. Why not teach him not to practice illicit sex? Then everything is done automatically. There's no need of contraceptive method. If one is trained up to indulge in sex only for begetting nice children, there is already contraceptive method. There is no necessity of unnecessarily producing cats and dogs children. So that requires training, determination. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says you should not become father if you cannot train up your children to save him from death. Who is the father who's training? To save him from the cycle of birth and death means to make him Kṛṣṇa conscious. So if you are not yourself Kṛṣṇa conscious, how you can train up your children to become Kṛṣṇa conscious? This is determination, that "If I cannot train my children to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and thus avoid the botheration of birth and death, I shall not have sex." That determination will save so many troubles. That can be done by practice. By engaging the mind in Kṛṣṇa, it is possible. The more you advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you'll lose interest in this sex life. In Vaikuṇṭha there is no sex life because the sex pleasure is not the foremost pleasure in the Vaikuṇṭhaloka. The sex pleasure is foremost here in this material world. They have got so much transcendental spiritual pleasure, this sex pleasure-they are astonished: is that pleasure? (Makes spitting sound) Phu! <span class="Italic">Yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinde nava-nava-rasa-dhāma...</span> That stage is possible. Still there are so many <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> So everything depends on practice. <span class="Italic">Abhyāsa yoga-yuktena [Bg. </span>8.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> That requires determination. (aside:) Where did you go, to take bath?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> This house just across.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is water? Well? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> There are barrels there, filling them daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not well? Have a big well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> They are getting water also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from this well. Your well is also going to that side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Have several wells in all places. That is nice. Is it very expensive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> It's expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is more expensive than carrying water and consume petrol? That is laziness. Once you have a well, then you save so much trouble. Get one well in each, our house. It is here very deep, uh? To get well? Tube-well? But there are so many creeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> We have what is called a springhouse. It's pure spring water, it's caught in reservoir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> At the other farm we have, as well as tube-well,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if in the spiritual sky there is no sex life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can store the snow. Yes. Big, big hole and collect the snow and put it here and cover it, it will stay. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> We have so much water, though, running off the hill, we can make lakes. We have three lakes now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Why don't you do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> You saw the Rādhā-kuṇḍa in the movie, in the film.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when one returns to his <span class="Italic">svarūpa,</span> his natural form, how does...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛtti.</span> You are accustomed to so many bad habits. First of all try to rectify it, then talk of <span class="Italic">svarūpa.</span> Where is your <span class="Italic">svarūpa</span>? Simply wasting time. A man is diseased, he's thinking, "When I shall be cured I shall eat, go to this hotel, I shall eat like this." First of all cure, then talk of eating this and that. <span class="Italic">Svarūpa,</span> when you are cured, that is <span class="Italic">svarūpa.</span> So long you are not cured, what is the use of talking <span class="Italic">svarūpa</span>? First business is cure yourself. <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛtti,</span> that is <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛtti.</span> Then <span class="Italic">svarūpa</span> will come. That is the <span class="Italic">bābājīs.</span> In Vṛndāvana, you have seen? <span class="Italic">Siddha-praṇālī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">siddha-praṇālī, siddha-deha</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are smoking and having illicit sex with one dozen women-<span class="Italic">svarūpa.</span> Rascal. This is called <span class="Italic">sahajiyā,</span> a rascal. Condemned. Where is your <span class="Italic">svarūpa</span>? Don't talk unnecessarily. First of all come to <span class="Italic">svarūpa,</span> then talk of <span class="Italic">svarūpa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So our motivation should be to get free from birth, disease, old age and death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already explained. But you must be determined how to execute devotional service. Without determined devotional service, how we can attain that position? So what is the use of talking utopian? First business is <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt. Ādau śraddhā tathaḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.</span> You adopt this means that you have got full faith that "Kṛṣṇa consciousness will save me." Then you live with devotees who are similarly determined. Then you execute devotional service. Then <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt,</span> you'll be free from all these.... These are the stages. There is.... Up to <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛtti,</span> you have to struggle very hard with determination, and then automatically everything will come. <span class="Italic">Tato niṣṭhā tato rucis tataḥ, athāsaktis tato bhāvaḥ.</span> So before <span class="Italic">svarūpa, anartha-nivṛtti,</span> don't expect all these. Read.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on the self alone and should think of nothing else." Purport: "By proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense activities. This is called <span class="Italic">pratyāhāra.</span> The mind, being controlled by conviction, meditation, and cessation of the senses, should be situated in trance, or <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> At that time there is no longer any danger of becoming engaged in the material conception of life. In other words, although one is involved with matter, as long as the material body exists, one should not think about sense gratification. One should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the Supreme Self. This state is easily attained by directly practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, before you said the patient has no intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he requires spiritual master's guidance. Because he is rascal. What is the use of accepting a spiritual master? If you want to be cured independently, what is the use of calling a physician, consulting a physician? You do it yourself. (pause) Whether our cows are left now? We don't find cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> They are at Govindajī temple. They are at the, where we will build Govindajī, at the main farm, Bahulavana, for Rādhā-Vṛndāvanacandra, and some at Vṛndāvana. In Vṛndāvana they are kept free to roam around, but at our farm in Bahulavana they have to be in pastures.</div>
