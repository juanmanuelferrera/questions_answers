<div class="Heading">Press Conference<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>April 18, 1974, Hyderabad</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...I shall speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> First His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda will speak something about our philosophy for a few minutes, and then you can ask questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā<br class="calibre2"/>sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā<br class="calibre2"/>mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 5.18.12]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">yasya-anyone; <span class="Italic">asti</span>-one, anyone who has; <span class="Italic">bhagavati-</span>in the Supreme Personality of Godhead; <span class="Italic">akiñcanā-bhakti-</span>unalloyed devotion, faith; <span class="Italic">sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ</span>-with all the good qualities of the demigods, he is bestowed upon.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ:</span> If one is not a devotee of the Lord, he has no good qualification. He cannot possess any good qualification. Why? <span class="Italic">Mano-rathena.</span> He is simply hovering on the mental plane. Therefore mind's business is to accept and reject. There cannot be any permanent thing. So one has to transcend above the plane of mind and fixed up in the spiritual platform. Then he can have all the good qualities.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> So at the present moment, the godless civilization... Therefore the leaders, they do not know how to lead people so that they may become happy. It is the duty of the leader, government, father, teacher, gurus, to see that the subordinates are very, very happy. We find in the history of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> that during the time of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira people were not suffering even from excessive heat or cold or any anxiety. So it is the duty of the leaders of the people and the government to see that the citizens are perfectly happy in their occupational duties and they are advancing in spiritual knowledge, because human life is not to live a polished animal life. That is not human life.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> we see that Ṛṣabhadeva, the father of Mahārāja Bharata, under whose name this planet is called Bhārata-varṣa, He taught His one hundred sons, "My dear boys, this human form of life is not meant for working hard like cats and dogs for sense gratification." Ultimate end is sense gratification, satisfying the senses. This is the business of the cats and hogs, or dogs and hogs. The hog is whole day working to find out stool: "Where is stool? Where is stool?" And as soon as he gets some stool, little strength, immediately sex life, without any discrimination whether she is mother or sister or daughter. This kind of life is described in the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> as hog civilization. So at the present moment, without any reference to God consciousness, people are being taught to satisfy the senses, work very hard, and ruin the chance of human life.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> This human life is especially meant for solving all the problems of live. There are so many problems of life, but the four problems, as indicated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam... [Bg. 13.9].</span> People have no knowledge how to stop birth, death, old age and disease. Because every living entity is eternal. That we learn from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> The living entity does not die even after the annihilation of this gross body. This is the first knowledge to understand. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> We have to transmigrate from this body to another body. As I have transmigrated already from my childhood body to boyhood body, boyhood body to youth-hood body, now I am in a body very old, so similarly, as I am existing in spite of changing so many types of body, similarly, after changing this body, I will have to accept another body. This is the fact. But the modern education, they do not know it, neither they believe, even the practical example is there. And who is giving the example? The most authoritative Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> And there are so many different varieties of bodies.</div>
<div class="Verse">jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati<br class="calibre2"/>kṛmayo rudra-saṅkhyakāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>pakṣiṇāṁ daśa-lakṣaṇam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">There are nine <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> varieties of life in the water. Similarly, twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> varieties of life in the trees and plants. Then there are insects, then there are birds, then there are animals, then there is human being. So this human form of body is obtained after evolution of many millions and trillions of years. It should not be... This is a chance for stopping this business of repetition of birth and death. But people, they have no knowledge how to stop it. Although everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> everything is explained, but we are not utilizing. We are manufacturing our own concocted knowledge. Therefore we are suffering. If we read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, then all the solution of human society's problem are there. Economic, social, political, religious, cultural, philosophical-everything is there.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for spreading the knowledge contained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, without any malinterpretation. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> After understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> from Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna affirmed, "Kṛṣṇa, You are Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Brahman... Every living entity is Brahman, or everything is Brahman. <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> That is a fact. But Parabrahman is Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the Vedic version. He is the Supreme. So unless we accept Kṛṣṇa the Supreme, what is the use of reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? So that we have to accept, and His instructions, as they are given, everything. Just like economic solution, there is in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is need of <span class="Italic">anna</span> to feed the animals and the human being. Simply by passing resolution, conference, it will not do. You must produce <span class="Italic">anna</span> so that animals and men, they may be fed sumptuously. They will get strength, then they can work for <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ.</span> In this way people can be happy.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> So everything, solution is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and we are trying to spread this knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> all over the world, and people are accepting. Now we have started in America a political party, "In God We Trust." So they are doing very successfully. People are accepting. They are criticizing the so-called leaders. After Nixon, people are disgusted with the so-called leaders. So we are teaching them what kind of leaders should be selected. The king, the public leader, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and... At least these three men, they should be free from the four kinds of sinful activities. If they are personally sinful, how they can lead other people? That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If a man is himself blind man, how he can lead other blind men? That is not... It is dangerous for both of them. So the leaders, the politicians, the king, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> they should be very much pure, without any sinful tinge of life. And the pillars of sinful life is illicit sex life and meat-eating and intoxication and gambling. Now, unfortunately, the leaders are teaching people how to enjoy illicit sex life, meat-eating and intoxication. Then how the society can be happy? It is not possible. If you become criminal or if you infect some disease, you must suffer. Similarly, in the material world there are three <span class="Italic">guṇas: sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.</span> So if you associate with <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> then you become enlightened. If you associate with <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa,</span> then you are, I mean to say, pushed through passion. And if you are in ignorance, then you do not know what is right and wrong. <span class="Italic">Kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye.</span> The symptoms of <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> is excessive lust and greediness. And <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> they are in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> Therefore the society must be divided into four classes of men, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are three <span class="Italic">guṇas,</span> and the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, brāhmaṇa,</span> a class of ideal men, must be there in the society so that people can follow them. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ lokas tad anuvartate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If there is no ideal men in the society, how they can be of good character? Therefore the brahminical class of men, I mean to say, in quality, <span class="Italic">satyaṁ śamo damas titikṣā ārjava, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> There must be an ideal class of men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> The next class, <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> who can give protection to the society, they should come forward whenever there is danger. They will come forward to give protection to the society. Similarly, next, the <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> they must produce. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> The class of men should be interested, produce foodgrains and give protection to the cows.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> So where are these things? How you can expect good society, good management? If you want good society, good management, people happy in this life and next, then you have to adopt the principles given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And we are preaching the cult of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> all over the world. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Now we open the placement to your questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, upon this, what I have already stated, you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Since you are following <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> do you believe in <span class="Italic">dvaita</span> philosophy or <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, first of all try to understand what is written in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then you try to understand the philosophy. It is simple thing. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti parjanyāt.</span> So there is no need of <span class="Italic">dvaita</span> philosophy or <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy. You require <span class="Italic">anna</span> to maintain the animals and living men. Practically. <span class="Italic">Dvaita</span> philosophy and <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy, this is controversial. But even though we agree to <span class="Italic">dvaita</span> philosophy or <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy, the question of food grain will be required, either you become <span class="Italic">dvaita</span> philosophy or <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I mean to say is do you believe that the soul and God is one as Rāmānuja and Śaṅkarācārya says, or as Madhvācārya says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are speaking from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. What Śaṅkarācārya says, what Rāmānujācārya says, that we shall consider there. You try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Bhagavān says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So <span class="Italic">dehinaḥ</span> means the possessor of the body, the owner of the body. That is the soul. So that you cannot deny, either you follow Śaṅkarācārya or Rāmānujācārya. There is soul within the body. This is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin, asmin dehe.</span> Just like I was a child, I remember; you remember also. So that body is now gone. But I have got a different body, you have got a different body. But I am existing. So I am <span class="Italic">dehinaḥ, dehī,</span> and my body is <span class="Italic">deha.</span> So <span class="Italic">deha-dehī,</span> there must be distinction. The body is not the owner. I am the owner. Just like I am sitting within this room, I am not this room; similarly, I am sitting within this body, you are sitting within your body. So you are not body. This is call illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What is the ultimate aim of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, ultimate aim is that there is spirit and matter. As there is material world, there is spiritual world also. <span class="Italic">Paras tasmāt tu bhāvaḥ anyaḥ avyaktaḥ avyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> The spiritual world is eternal. The material world is temporary. We are spirit soul. We are eternal. Therefore our business is to go back to the spiritual world, not that we remain in the material world and change body from bad to worse or worse to bad, er, good. That is not our business. That is a disease. Our healthy life is to enjoy eternal life. <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6].</span> So our human life should be utilized for attaining that perfectional stage-not to get any more this material body which we have to change. This is the aim of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Is that perfection possible in one life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in one moment, if you agree. Kṛṣṇa says that</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-dharmān parityajya<br class="calibre2"/>mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo<br class="calibre2"/>mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.66]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">We change our body on account of sinful activities, but if we surrender to Kṛṣṇa and take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, immediately you are on the spiritual platform.</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">As soon as you become unalloyed devotee of Kṛṣṇa, you immediately transcend this material platform. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.</span> You remain in the spiritual platform. And if you die in the spiritual platform, then you go to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But isn't the <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> that you do for concentration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> is concentration, reading is concentration...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, besides that, any other type of concentration you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by concentration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When you think... <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The yogis, in <span class="Italic">dhyāna,</span> in meditation, they always see the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu within the heart. So that is meditation. <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they see by cultivation of knowledge, and the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> they see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So Supreme Lord, the Absolute Truth, is understood from different angles of vision. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam</span> [SB 1.2.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Yaj jñānam advayam.</span> There is no difference between Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. The same thing in different angle of vision. The <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they realize as impersonal Brahman. The yogis, they realize as Paramātmā situated in everyone's heart. And the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> they realize as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But the thing is the same. It is the different angle of vision only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What exactly is guru's role in your system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To teach how to get rid of this disease of birth, death and old age. That is guru's business. That is also father's business, that is also guru's business, or the caretaker's business, the government's business. Because this human life is meant for getting out of these clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> constantly, repeatedly changing body. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">], bhūtvā pralīyate.</span> This business should be stopped. <span class="Italic">Na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyuṁ gurur na sa syāt. Śāstra </span>says, "One should not be guru if he cannot deliver the disciple from the chain of birth, death, old age and disease."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (indistinct-question about why there is a better response to Kṛṣṇa consciousness in foreign countries than in India)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Americans and the Europeans, they are fed up with this material type of civilization. They are... They know that spiritual life is there in India. They understand it. Therefore, any swami goes there, they go round him to take some spiritual instruction. Unfortunately, mostly they go who have no knowledge. They cannot give them right knowledge. So for the time being they may surround them, but after some time they disperse. Because they do not get actually. Because so far Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, now many swamis went there and they preached <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also, but not a single person became a devotee of Kṛṣṇa for the last hundreds of years. But now <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is being presented as it is, and people are taking it by hundreds, thousands. So they are after some knowledge, spiritual knowledge, from India, but our so-called swamis, they go, they do not give actual information of the Indian spiritual culture. Therefore they are practically deceived. But this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, we do not change anything. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are teaching them that "Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa." So they are accepting. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are teaching that "Just always think of Kṛṣṇa, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and you will remember Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> "And just become devotee. Worship the Deity of Kṛṣṇa. Become His <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span>" <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī.</span> "Worship Lord Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Māṁ namaskuru.</span> "Offer your obeisances to Kṛṣṇa." So we are teaching this <span class="Italic">arcanam.</span> We have got hundred temples like this all over the world. And hundreds and thousands are joining. So this is practical. So they are accepting. Now it is our duty to give the actual Vedic culture which is concise, summarized in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sarvopaniṣad-gavaḥ, </span>the essence of all <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> teaching. So there is very good demand for this culture, but unfortunately we give some rubbish things, and they come. Sometimes they go, that he becomes himself God. What is this nonsense? God is so cheap? So they have been frustrated, and our people go and still more frustrate them by giving some cheating type of... But here <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is very simple. There is no need of great education. What is the difficulty to understand? If Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">,</span> where is the difficulty? "You always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me, offer My obeisances." <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam: [Bg. </span>4.13] "Divide the society in four classes of men." <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni: [Bg. </span>3.14] "You just produce sufficient foodgrain and eat sufficiently. Be strong. Perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span>" Where is the difficulty to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Do you think that the Russian society is not put off by this <span class="Italic">bhajana</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Russian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know Russian society, but I can say I have been in Moscow. The people are not happy. That I can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How many of your disciples would have seen the vision of God in the sense of seeing the Lord given in their heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vision of God you can see also. Here is vision of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In the sense of seeing the Lord in their own heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is, of course, later on. First of all see here is God, vision of God. Everyone can see. It is public. Why you ask my disciples? You can see also. No, no. That like, vision of God, here is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is physical vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Physical means vision; your vision is also physical. Your vision is not spiritual. Whatever you see with your eyes, that is physical. That is not anything beyond physical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> See with spiritual eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual eyes, that's all right. But first of all you have to see whatever eyes you have got. You have got physical eyes. Why you are talking of spiritual eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, sir, that only, we are, all these things would learn that spiritual eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you will learn. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">. </span>When you develop love for God, then you can that spiritual eyes. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva.</span> He sees everywhere, always. <span class="Italic">Santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilo...</span> That you have to develop that position. Immediately you cannot do that. Yes, immediately you have to see physically. Then gradually, when by offering service, you develop your dormant love for God, then you can see spiritual. It is not immediately or for everyone. So you have to wait for tha position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Consciousness movement in the West-like you said, the Western people are fed up with materialism. Is it that they are fed up only with materialism or with...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, people, people have become godless everywhere. It doesn't matter whether he is a Christian or Muhammadan or Hindu. That is a general disease. So actually, everyone is concerned now with material comforts. But these material comforts mean wine and women, that's all. Substance of material comforts. So that they have enjoyed enough. The facility of enjoying woman and getting money, there is no limit. There is no limit. Anyone, the money is thrown in the street. You can simply collect. And similarly, women are available. So actually, they do not get any happiness by these material elements. They are seeking after something, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> But isn't the Kṛṣṇa consciousness has not spread in the Arab world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is spreading. We have got branch in Iran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. We have got branch in Moscow, we have got in China. But they are taking gradually. Everything will take time. But we have got many Muhammadan students. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> You have got a center established in Iran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Within what time? Recent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think about two years. Yes. We have got African students also, many African students. And everywhere we are spreading this Hare Kṛṣṇa. We go village to village, they accept. In African village, with big, big earrings, they also dance in Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> How do they respond in China?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, China also. They also receive very nicely. They are intel... Everywhere the people are always good. They are made bad by the leaders. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> You know, it sticks in the mind, about the leaders and the government, you said it. Is the duty of the leaders of the government to see the people are happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> In this context, how do you see the government of India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not wish to speak of any particular government. But generally, everywhere the government is not very good. Even in America, the president is not liked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Swamiji, India is supposed to be a land of spirituality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> How is it that there is so much moral degradation in our country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you did not lead them, you did not teach them spiritual books. You allowed them to read Communist books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Is it the failure of our spiritual leaders?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is a spiritual leader? First of all we have to think..., if the businessman is not spiritual leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> So you mean the lack of spiritual leadership has driven us to this state of affairs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because there have been so many. Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is standard book. The so-called spiritual leaders, they give different interpretation. Why different interpretation? One interpretation is there. Anyone can understand. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is plain thing, Kṛṣṇa says that "You always think of Me." <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> "You become My devotee, you just worship Me, offer your obeisance." And Dr. Radhakrishnan says, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa personally." What right he has got to say like that? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava.</span> Dr. Radhakrishnan says, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." This is going on. Just see. He is scholar, he is a philosopher. Even Gandhi says that "There was no Kṛṣṇa; it is all mythology." Then? How people will learn it? If Kṛṣṇa becomes mythology, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> becomes imagination and anyone can interpret in any way. Then where is the teaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Are the teachings themself spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all try to understand that what is the defect. The defect is that malinterpretation, bad interpretation. Interpretation is required when a thing you cannot understand. But if a thing is clearly understood, why you interpret to mislead the leader? That is our protest. It is clearly understood. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">. Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then what right you have got to say that "It is not Kṛṣṇa; it is something else"? That has misled our country. Do you admit or not? This misinterpretation. Why should you misinterpret in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? If you have got a different philosophy, you can write your own books, but why through B<span class="Italic">hagavad-gītā</span>? This is very dangerous. This is very, very dangerous. It has spoiled the whole country. You write your own philosophy. But why do you take advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and misinterpret it and mislead the people? That is my protest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> What is the plan of the Hyderabad project?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hyderabad project. That he knows, Mahāṁśa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> What your goal, to plan Northern India? Your goal to plan Northern India? How long you will be staying and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am going to see Bālajī. That's all. Bālajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> And then go back to the States?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I will go to Europe and... I'll go to London, then to Paris, then Germany, then Sweden, then Switzerland. I have got temples there. In Germany we have got four temples. In Sweden we have got. In Switzerland we have got. France we have got. In England we have got four, five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> No government is placing obstacles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they receive it very nicely. They understand that "Swamiji is doing something nice." Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda! (end)</div>
