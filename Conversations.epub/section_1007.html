<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's a hundred miles away from Paris(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a big name. What...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Lucay de La Male.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The interior, near Orleans. So we have got very nice, beautiful palace. We have installed Gaura-Nitāi and Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi) Vṛndāvana Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. Four hundred acres land, we are producing our vegetables, vegetables, fruits, and food grains, milk, and two hundred devotees, they are living very happily. (converses in Hindi) It is, for health it is very nice. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> We were planning on your staying over there, and this last night this thing happened. So this morning we tried our best to complete your room, but then finally it was not coming off, so I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> It came as a surprise that one o'clock he says Prabhupāda will be staying here. We said nothing more than that, it will be my privilege, but I was just embarrassing, whether it would be inconvenient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not inconvenient. But now we have comfort. For staying, it is the best place. There is no question about it. But because for the function we have come, so little too far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> To be near the program and see what is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore even it is little inconvenient. (Hindi conversation) What is the position now about this political situation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Political situation remains the same. No elections, nothing for the time being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mahāṁśa was saying that the businessman is in trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes, business is not prospering since last two, three years. Business conditions are not picking up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> A general recession throughout the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Depression. Not for any political reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No, on account of emergency also, Swamiji, mostly these people are afraid of (indistinct). Government has right powers, whereby without question, nobody has the power to question in the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> If the arrest means even the constable can come and arrest. So all these foodgrain, many other things, after all there may be countervention in some way or the other. Rules which are made, terms and conditions laid out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long this will continue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They say up to February, because this February she must have elections. Otherwise, there should be an amendment in the Constitution to allow her to continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is being made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> This present government will serve no indication to that, that she will be allowed. Because as far as the Constitution, only one year extension can be given to Parliament, that nobody has followed through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> One year extension to the existing Parliament is given as per Constitution. After one year it must dissolve if it is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the Constitution. But that is going to be changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> No that clause is not proposed to be changed. The changes which she is bringing in decision, that clause at least is not proposed to be changed. The last proposition she made...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We were surprised as usual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> There were some questions in Parliament about her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes, it came in the Hindu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them inquire. Our... Everything is open secret. We are selling books throughout the whole world to the extent of six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> rupees per day. So money is coming from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Here only Swamiji, Prabhupāda, just now this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you don't like this, you can close India, we can go all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, there is a very big scope there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, but here even it would declare it. Minister of State. Only Communist have put those questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Communists are seeing this movement as a great danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, great danger for their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are spreading God consciousness. [break] By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, we have no debts. We are (indistinct) simply find out... (?) Now in Bombay I am getting from my Book Fund seven <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per month regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> per month is coming. Otherwise that work will not progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have given them three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> This is the newspaper article which came in Hindu, the Hindu paper, about the government asking something about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Communist party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> "New Delhi, August 13th. Mr. Om Mehta, Minister of State for Home, informed the <span class="Italic">Rājya-sabhā</span> yesterday that government will order an inquiry into the activities of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Society in Nadia District of West Bengal to find out whether there was something fishy about it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the same report Gopāla Kṛṣṇa read you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> You have read this, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> It must have come in earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the name is "Kṛṣṇa Caitanya." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it's ten-thirty. Would you like anything to eat or drink before we take rest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's puffies and peanuts and hot milk. Puffies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Puffies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Puffed rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Puffed rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And some fried, and there's hot milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can give me little puffed rice. (long pause) During wartime some, during noncooperation movement, so one firm, they were supplying printing machine, and, very famous firm, forgot the name. So they had 113 branches all over the world. So somebody questioned that "If you British boycott, if by boycott movement, if your firm is closed..." So the manager replied, "So what is wrong there? If one branch is closed, we'll still have 112 branches all over the world." So if the Communist party in India they want like that, so we have our own branches all over. (slapping sound-for mosquito?) Don't kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> This book sales all over the world, six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty thousand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Dollars. About five <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Books. We are printing books five <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> three <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> fifty thousand. Lowest twenty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And repetition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They expect to sell twenty thousand copies in one week now. When a new book is published, that first batch of twenty thousand will sell in one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here is? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> It was a touch-and-go thing. It was, when we finished, just enough for the opening, and afterwards the work could go on for another one month, finishing work. It was coming out very, very beautiful. Everyone who comes in, they like the whole, the hall is very big and massive, it's very ornamental, and it will be very, very popular. Oh, yes, already people all over Andhra Pradesh know about it. We have done some good publicity. The press has given us some good covering. Tomorrow is a press conference. Their press conference starts at five. We are going to have a film show for them and <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> and all that before Your Grace goes there. And then afterwards there is a program at Muthilal Rao's house. We had a program there before in his garden, if you remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is some ambassador?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, for Somalia. Now he has come back. He just, he's very, very favorable for you. Because, we were talking and he was blasting all the Śaṅkarācāryas, he was blasting all the different gurus and everyone, and he says the only guru is Śrīla Prabhupāda. He says he met our devotees in Africa, he's been to London and other temples in Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he has seen our temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He has seen our temples in Europe and Africa and he was very, very impressed. So when I told him that Prabhupāda is coming for the inauguration, he said, "You must give me the privilege again to have a program." So tomorrow evening there will be a program there, and on the 18th morning at ten o'clock, between ten and ten-thirty is the <span class="Italic">prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā.</span> The chief minister is coming there as the chief guest, and it will stay till about twelve o'clock. I wanted to have a feast for all the people as we did in Vṛndāvana, but it's not possible here because there's no space. The area around the temple is very little. So we have made these kinds of packages with different items, just like a little <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> feast, small. We'll be giving everyone who comes, about ten thousand packages we are preparing. We'll be distributing <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> like that. And then in the evening there's a program again, Janmāṣṭamī program, this is for public. The morning program we have restricted only to invitees, because it will be so crowded otherwise. This is one problem which I am trying to figure out, how to face of managing the crowd. The space around the temple is very small, so we cannot have very big, huge assembly. We have to figure out something about that. I'm still trying to think what to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of management. Anyone comes, if you have made packages for distribution, give a package.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> There will be a lot of confusion, Prabhupāda, there. And what we should do in that passage, we should make them sit, as we were discussing, about six hundred or so. We should make the passage and put <span class="Italic">daddis(?)</span> these on that and make all the visitors and guests sit on that, and immediately after <span class="Italic">pratiṣṭhā</span> is over, installation of the Deities and all, one by one they should be allowed to go have <span class="Italic">darśana</span> and come back. When they return, give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Not in package, <span class="Italic">bhoogi</span> (?) sweet, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you want to arrange. When they're going back. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> That way there won't be any rush. Otherwise, they will be stampeding the temple. Then nobody would have to rush in the temple. This is how they did at this Veṅkateśvara temple Birlas have constructed. They, though I was not there, someone was saying that all the guests were made to sit. Whoever was coming, they were made to sit, and then after all the distribution, everything was over, they were just made to one by one go around the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You make that arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Yes. If there are no rains that arrangement will go through very nicely. Only if there is no rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> If it rains, then there will be a problem. Everyone will try and rush into the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> In Janmāṣṭamī day usually many times it rains also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is the puffed rice? Somebody is bringing it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Pālikā is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why Pālikā, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Pālikā is in the kitchen taking care of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, bring it to... Why you making there, puffed rice? There is... It is too late now. (long pause) So what she is doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I will check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> She is cooking <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cooking? What she is cooking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Only puffed rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, what she is cooking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I'll just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Here it comes. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (Hindi) (end)</div>
