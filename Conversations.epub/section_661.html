<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Find out. First of all He spoke that... If you take history of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then it comes to forty millions of years ago, at least, He spoke <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> How do you calculate? The calculation is there. Any intelligent man can calculate because Brahmā's duration of life is mentioned there. <span class="Italic">Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brāhmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. </span>8.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> So one <span class="Italic">yuga</span> means forty-three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of years and multiply it one thousand. That is Brahmā's duration of one day. Now, in one day there are seven Manus. So Vivasvān Manu's age can be calculated-at least forty millions of years ago. So the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not a new thing. It was spoken five thousand years ago to Arjuna. That was not the first speaking. He says, "I first spoke to Vivasvān, the sun-god." Yes, show him. (Bengali) ...I am manufacturing something. Everything is there. "If you simply follow, a great, wonderful thing will be done." She is now in a position. Simply she has to take the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and apply it practically. And that is not very difficult. Just like the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti... Parjanyād bhavanti bhūtāni.</span> Make this program, immediately.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lalitā:</span> Fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They understood that "This man does not show any magic, and he is playing wonderful thing."

When I was at <span class="Italic">Kumbha-melā</span> all these Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they were receiving me like anything because they understand that they could not do anything.
