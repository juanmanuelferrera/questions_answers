<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...I am your friend, I am God, so you sleep, I shall do everything. In Russia like that. When Arjuna refused to fight He chastised him like anything. What is the <span class="Italic">anārya-juṣṭam?</span> He's just like non-Aryans, talking foolish. People should clearly understand that we don't encourage laziness. We never encourage. According to your capacity, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> you must work. <span class="Italic">Śarīra yātrāpi te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ,</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "By not working, even if you cannot put on your body and soul together." Kṛṣṇa says like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Isn't laziness one of the demonic qualities, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is less than demonic. Demonic qualities, they have some activity and laziness is ignorance, darkness. Therefore too much sleeping is very, very bad. That is another part of laziness. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**, one has to conquer over this sleeping and laziness. Eating, <span class="Italic">nidrā, ahāra, vihāra,</span> sense gratification, <span class="Italic">vihāra</span> means sense gratification. One has to minimize these things up to the point of nil, that is perfect. When there is no more sleeping, no more eating, no more mating, and no more fearing, that is perfection of spiritual life. And that is not possible, but as much as possible. [break] ...they cannot sleep more that the culture (?) is very great gain, profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Consider a rich man. A rich man can sleep, a poor man must work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They're always making agitation to reduce what they call the work week. Formerly they were working so many hours per week, now they want to reduce it down to forty, thirty, twenty hours per week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they're inventing machine? Machine means no work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They think this is progress, everyone can lie down and the machines will work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, machine, inventing machine means one machine can work for fifty men. The banks are using this, what is that, computer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, everyone is using computers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To save money. Machine means unemployment for many. Tractor, they're using, they're unemployment for bulls and plowmen and then they, bulls have to be killed. This is going on. Unemployment, then kill them. Vietnam, send all the men to fight and kill them. As soon as there is overpopulation, they declare war so that people may be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Sometimes the soldiers became so disgusted that they would shoot their own officers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But they would do it in such a way so it appeared to be accidents. Sometimes they would take little bomb and throw it into the tent of the officers and they would all be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, because the officers, they were not qualified. They were simply foolish. They were directing them in such a way that they were all in danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And they could not understand why they were there. It was a foreign... They were used to America and so they had to go to the jungle but they were, they could not see the point of fighting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So many times they would become so disgusted they would simply kill their own officers, shoot them or throw a bomb. Also in Vietnam, the majority of the soldiers were fighting intoxicated, marijuana and different drugs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Also I think people have no respect for authority any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> There's... All over the world people are not respecting any kind of authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> There are so many false...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Especially the students. That means chaotic condition. [break] ...type of civilization, this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Tagore (?) is so nice that your divine grace was presenting the perfect authority, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And one who follows His instruction, he also perfect. That we are pushing (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything will be all right. Everyone is fallen, I asked this question to Kotofsky. "Sir, you have got a leader, we have got a leader, so where is the difference?" And then I said, "Only you have got a fool leader, we have got intelligent leader." Otherwise you cannot avoid leadership, authority. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> They want to avoid but they... Impersonalists are catering to that desire, they want to avoid authority and so the impersonalists are encouraging that. So they are rascals, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not possible to give up authority. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Your interview, those articles that you had spoken about, against Communism, are very, very brilliant. Actually we were struck with wonder to see the different arguments. Very, very important for South America because there the Communism is popular among the young students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, we just published it in our magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So they like that argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, the argument was so intelligent that no one has ever thought of such intelligent arguments against Communism. Also the article on Freud, I think that book is very, very important. It will actually satisfy the students. No one else would dare to call these people fools. (laughter) (end)</div>
