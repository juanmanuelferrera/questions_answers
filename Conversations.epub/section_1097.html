<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the mercy incarnation for all people. How we can question upon this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So you are elaborating on this thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ignorance. Stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mūḍhaḥ nābhijānāti.</span> You take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. <span class="Italic">Mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvaiḥ.</span> Oh, that is given to that doctor. (Hindi) But that knowledge is being neglected by Indians, and the whole world is in ignorance. The knowledge has to be given by India because knowledge is in India. But the Indians, they have become rascals. They are imitating the rascals. This is reply. India should have given knowledge to the whole world. Instead of, these rascals are imitating their ways of life, and knowledge remains in the darkness throughout the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What do you find, you know, that when you impart this knowledge to Western disciples and when you talk to someone who are in India, what difference do you find?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian men refuse this culture. India's leader, beginning from Gandhi and all, they do not know what is India's culture. They have forgotten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Would you like to include Gandhi also in that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Otherwise, how it can be? <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But he was the one who also preached <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he did not know <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Actually. Recently I have been in his <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> They are maintaining the <span class="Italic">chattai</span> (?) and the lantern in memory. What is that? If Mahatma Gandhi understood <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> he should have introduced that <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> in <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Where is that? The <span class="Italic">chattai</span> (?) food arrangement is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So that is done by his disciples and not by him. He never...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he could not make his disciple correctly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That is true. That is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he did not know. Now see how my disciples are working all over the world within ten years. I am sitting here, still going on, my business. So you have to train in such a way. The Deity worship is going on. Bring that recent Denver pictures. They are now opening different branches, establishing Deity exactly in the way I have trained. It is a question of training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> How your preaching differs from various <span class="Italic">ācāryas?</span> Say, Śaṅkara or Vallabha or Rāmānuja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just in the line of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But you are just in the line or you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> established hundreds and thousands of temples. So I am establishing all over the world. What did in India I am doing all over the world. Now just see how they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Each <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> differed in interpretation of religion and approach to it. You diff... Śaṅkara and Vallabha say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two sections, the impersonalist and the personalist. The personalists are the Vaiṣṇavas, and the impersonalists are the Māyāvādīs. So far the spiritual life is concerned, there is no difference. There is no difference. Just like Śaṅkara. Śaṅkarācārya said that <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> The spiritual life is reality. And this is nonreality. But we say that this is <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa said. We are follower of Kṛṣṇa. "This is a place of suffering. And if you come to Me then your suffering ends." So this world is condemned either by Śaṅkarācārya, or others, everyone. But the modern rascals, they have taken this world as everything. Therefore they are in ignorance. Do you follow? They have taken this world, this life of fifty years or sixty years, at most hundred years, as reality. These rascals have no knowledge that we have life after annihilation of this body. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Who knows it? Bring big, big men, big, big politician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What about so many saints who are preaching yoga and religion all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who does not know the science, they are not saint. They are cheaters. If they do not know the science, what is spiritual life, what is material life. So their speaking is simply cheating. Therefore we should state the standard, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam.</span> Take the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, even Śaṅkarācārya. So there must be standard. It is... Some of them are manufacturing some spiritual life. Just like Vivekananda did, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> Is there any such word in our Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstras? Daridra-nārāyaṇa?</span> Nārāyaṇa has become <span class="Italic">daridra?</span> One has to worship <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You don't agree with what has been preached...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I agree? Because there is no such thing in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Is there word, any word, in the whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, but what Ramakrishna Paramahaṁsa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramakrishna, how he become <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> if he does not know the <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span> That is the difficulty. Everyone becoming self-made guru, self-made <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> self-made saint. That is the difficulty. Without any reference to the authentic <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So it's a very revealing thing, you deny Ramakrishna Paramahaṁsa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't deny. You accept, you accept. My point is unless it is authoritatively mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> we reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> were written thousands of years ago. Life might have changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> it is not said that after passing of many years the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> becomes obsolete. This is another ignorance. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> is not like that. You write some mental speculation and after some years it changes. That is not <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> is this... Just like the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> was, five thousand years ago it was it was written... And the symptoms of Kali, Kali-yuga is written there in the Twelfth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The complete purport was written five thousand years back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But most of the scholars, they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not a scholar. He's a rascal. We have to follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> The <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> never said. There are so many <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> They never say. So, we have to follow, <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam,</span> not the rascals. We cannot worship the rascals. Worship <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> They are guide. So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says... Find out <span class="Italic">sa evāyaṁ mayā te 'dya yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Purātanaḥ,</span> Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I spoke this science to Vivasvān, the sun-god." So if you calculate sun, this sun, Vivasvān, is the father of Manu, Vaivasvata Manu. And if you take, calculate, it becomes forty millions of years. So this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is spoken, according to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> according to the version of Kṛṣṇa, forty millions of years ago. Now He says that science was known to the people by <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> And that <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> is lost somehow or other. Therefore as... [break] Suppose you are born in Bombay, but you do not know how the state is being managed, then what is my <span class="Italic">jñāna?</span> If you do not know how the state is being managed then what is your <span class="Italic">jñāna?</span> That <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is, dogs and cats, they have also <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> How to eat, how to sleep, how to use sex life, how to defend. This is not <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> Everyone knows it. If you know God, who is conducting the whole, that is <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> So if you do not know who is the supreme controller...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Knowing God through <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> is one thing, but can a realization come in life as Arjuna had?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> As Arjuna had the <span class="Italic">viśvarūpa-darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not... Arjuna said, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> For that <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> you have to become <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> to the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> or it is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But then you can get the realization, what Arjuna got, <span class="Italic">viśvarūpa-darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything. If you go, <span class="Italic">tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā upadekṣyanti tad jñānam</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is this process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If it is not too much a personal question, have you had a <span class="Italic">saksaska?(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise, why I am talking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But what was your experience of that <span class="Italic">saksaska?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now how you will understand unless you come to the science? [break] Gandhi manufactured. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is spoken in the battlefield, and he wanted to draw the conclusion of nonviolence. What is this? Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ viṣame...</span> "In this battlefield you are talking of nonsense, that 'I'll not fight.' " He says so and Gandhi wanted to make it nonviolent. Just see how from the very beginning he distorted. And people accept it. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> He was a <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha,</span> leader. So whatever he will say people will accept. The whole India became spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But the way to <span class="Italic">saksaska</span> (?) is only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saksaska</span> is... Kṛṣṇa is speaking, "Here I am." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now why not <span class="Italic">saksaska?</span> You can have. Unless you believe... You do not believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It is a...? It is a belief or is it...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rather, if somebody says, "I am your father." So if you don't believe then how it can be believed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But there is somebody, some concrete person, telling me that "I am your father," but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Nobody knows who is his father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I want to understand, Guruji, that the <span class="Italic">saksaska,</span> is it a sort of emotional belief or it is a concrete...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No emotional. It is fact. Concrete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Concrete reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If your mother says, "Here is your father," that's all right. You don't require any other. And that is <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> Mother knows how you were created by your father. So she is the ultimate evidence. That's all. You cannot speculate. If you disbelieve your mother, then there is no question of understanding your father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We all have at certain moments of devotion some sort of feelings when we feel we are very much near the God. But that concrete reality, to attain that, the only way is <span class="Italic">jñāna, upāsanā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> But the <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> must be received through the right source. <span class="Italic">Jñāna</span> is not speculation. The modern rascals, they create <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> by speculation. That is not <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> That is <span class="Italic">ajñāna.</span> The same example. If you don't receive <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> from your mother, there is no <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> of father. If you millions of years go on speculating who is your father he'll never be revealed. That is not <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> That is <span class="Italic">ajñāna.</span> So these rascals, they are creating <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> That is not <span class="Italic">jñāna. Jñāna</span> means you should receive <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> through the right source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And what is the <span class="Italic">upāsanā</span> you will be prescribing for those people who want to achieve <span class="Italic">jñāna?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">upāsanā.</span> It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam ācāryopāsanam [Bg. 13.8]. Vinigrahaḥ, indriya-vinigrahaḥ.</span> Find out this, Thirteenth Chapter. These are the process. First of all <span class="Italic">amānitvam.</span> You have to surrender yourself that "I am insignificant." But in beginning you are puffed up. "I am so academic. Now I have got Ph.D." Rascals. First, beginning is <span class="Italic">amānitvam.</span> And as soon as we become puffed-up, a little knowledge... A Little knowledge is dangerous. Then finished. So they are doing like that. A little knowledge, I think, "I have become more than my Guru Mahārāja." Finished. That is the defect. Find out. Read the...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is after sense gratification. No <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> And he's in knowledge. His qualification is like dog and he has become a man of knowledge. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Asaktir anabhiṣvaṅgaḥ putra-dāra-gṛha.</span> Everyone is attached. And this is ignorance. This is illusion. That developed society, community, nationality. But what is that? That attachment. But that attachment has to be taken away. That is knowledge. But we are teaching people how to become more and more attached in the name of Communism, Socialism, this ism, that ism, nationalism. These things are not given. The truth in all this means increasing <span class="Italic">putra-dāra-gṛhādiṣu.</span> Not <span class="Italic">asakti</span> but <span class="Italic">āsakti.</span> Increasing ignorance. Then?</div>

But they are not concerned with these things. They are simply disturbed with little temporary discomfort. Then?</div>

Try to understand the reality. But we, we become political leader, and if one thousand or one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of people give me a few claps I think I become perfect. What you are perfect? The next moment by the laws of nature you'll be slapped and taken away. Who could save Gandhi when he was fired by the laws by the nature? That clapping would not save me. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> When Kṛṣṇa will come and put you death, what you will do?

Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> If people take it they'll be benefited. This simple mission. We are following Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that you become guru. Everyone become guru. So how shall I become guru? Very simple thing.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Bas. Simply if we repeat what is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then we become guru. And if you can convince a person, one person, then you get your... But no. They are creating their own manufactured knowledge, manufactured process, and exploiting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> What is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they'll never say. They'll take a <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and pose himself that "I am a great scholar of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I have got my own interpretation that I go to hell and you go to hell." That's all.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why you are asking? You study then whether they have spoken something else or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is your business. Why you are asking me? But we say anyone who says against <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he's a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, but they have said something in favor of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I don't see that they have made one single Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> neither they were Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> What kind of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> they have read I do not know. I see by the result. The last word of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto... Mām eva... Sarva-dharmān.</span> That is study of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They do not speak of Kṛṣṇa anywhere, that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, you become a devotee." Now how he has read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> I shall take it? Simply make jugglery of words? We have to see the result. They have neither made one Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> neither they were Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> How he has read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Tell me. This is the test. They... Whole country is after Gandhi or Aurobindo or big, big. But who is Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> under their direction? Now we are simply following Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just see. Thousands are become Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> See by practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Simply by chanting Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever Kṛṣṇa has said we are speaking. That's all. We have no botheration. We haven't got to manufacture ideas. And that is being effective. See practically. Similarly, if you do that the whole world will be student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And if you manufacture your nonsense idea it is useless. <span class="Italic">Sa kāleneha yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa. Bas. Naṣṭa.</span> So it is <span class="Italic">naṣṭa, hogya</span> [finished]. If it is lost, if it is decomposed, then what will be the benefit? Suppose if I supply you some nice foodstuff but it is rotten, <span class="Italic">naṣṭa,</span> then what benefit you'll get? If I give you some fresh prepared nice foodstuff, you'll get some benefit out of it. But if I give you rotten thing in the name of foodstuff, then what benefit you'll get? So Kṛṣṇa says as soon as you break this <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system it is rotten. So, by jugglery of our words, if you present rotten things, what benefit they will get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What is your message for Indian people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That people take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. You'll be benefited, the whole world will be benefited. Our thing is simple. It is stated there, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> You learn first of all <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and you preach. They are hankering after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What do you think of miracle saints? The saints who perform miracles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Miracles? Why do you want miracles? What miracle? Can you save a man from death? Can you show this miracle? This miracle means cheating. The real problem is <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No but can a saint...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are after miracles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, but one thing. Is it possible for a saint at certain stage of <span class="Italic">sādhana</span> to perform miracles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is cheating. Here, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you don't find anywhere that you show miracles. He says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> He never says that you show miracles. These are all rascals. You become His <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> That is the greatest miracle. And he guarantees, <span class="Italic">mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaṁ.</span> That is miracle. What is this miracle, cheating other people by showing some magic or jugglery of words. These are miracles? That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But to a layman what would you preach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Layman, if he does not go to the right man he'll suffer. What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But where should it begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Begin when one who is Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> Begin there.</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva...<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Who has seen actually Kṛṣṇa, go to him. But you are going to somebody who can manufacture gold. Because you are not concerned with Kṛṣṇa. You are concerned with gold. That is your motive. So you must be cheated. You want to be cheated. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know. Life's mission is how to achieve the platform where I can talk with Kṛṣṇa, I can talk with Lord. Where is that? Nobody knows that. They do not believe there is Kṛṣṇa, there is Lord, there is God and you can see Him, you can talk with Him. They do not believe. Mostly impersonalists. And impersonalists, they're all mostly atheists. So what they'll do by jugglery and this magic? This magic will be finished within twenty or thirty years. That will be finished. Show this magic that "No! No more death." That is real magic. What is this magic? In a moment you'll be slapped and go. Then <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> You do not know where you are going. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> But you do not know what kind of body you are going to get. So what this magic will do? So these are for less intelligent persons. They are not for sane persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> For spreading this movement in India, are you hopeful it will be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Those who are sincere. Those who are after jugglery, magic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They will not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will be cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian doctor:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the medical we are preparing (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now it is late. So you stay, take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian doctor:</span> No, I'm... I am here only for three, four times a year. And get everything done. I'll give instruction in writing, they will write it down and I'll be there till evening or five tomorrow and go out for the preparation. These are to be taken with the the bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Do it. For the time being, what I took yesterday, my lunch, I'll take. And these things we can begin from tomorrow because it is already arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian doctor:</span> No, pills can be taken. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It is there in <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And if you don't care for the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> if you manufacture your own way, then, as it is stated, <span class="Italic">na siddhiṁ sāvāpnoti.</span> You'll never be successful. <span class="Italic">Na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim.</span> Neither happiness nor better life will be next or the supreme goal. These things finished. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]. If you do not take the guidance of the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> then all your hope is finished. You can hope, but you'll never... This is our... Therefore we follow the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> and we teach others to follow <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> If you like you can do. Otherwise do whatever you like. But you don't manufacture and spoil my life and others. You don't do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> There was some trouble with your movement in America recently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't care for this trouble. If you are sincere it is all right. We are facing so many difficulties. We don't care for it. We never compromise. All my students, they will never compromise. Why shall I compromise? If I am confident that I am speaking the truth, why shall I make compromise? Those who are not confident of his position, they will make compromise. One who does not know where he stands, he will make compromise. And if I know where I am standing, why shall I make compromise? Let others do whatever he likes. This is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Do not strain guru too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Thank you very much. (offer obeisances) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Most important movement. (Hindi) You are in a good position. Try to convince others. Life should be for <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> Not exploiting. This is India's mission. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is India's... Anyone who has taken birth in India, first of all make his life perfect by understanding the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> The gist of <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And then distribute the knowledge. <span class="Italic">Para-upakāra.</span> This should be India's mission. India hasn't got to learn from anywhere else. Everything is there. Let him understand the whole philosophy of life perfectly and distribute this. This is India's mission. So I have tried alone on this point. So I have got little success. And before me so many swamis, yogis went there. They came and go. No effect. Now I have created a community which will continue. They're now saying, "American Hindus." Therefore there is opposition. They understand, "Now it will stand." It is not that Vivekananda's <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Something permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
