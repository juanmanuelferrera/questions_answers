<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like bodily action. Now you feel call of nature. So you have to pass urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> No, that is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Does not attach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> That action, you're not attached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti yoga.</span> Last stage of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> finally, is said like that, <span class="Italic">māṁ ca yo avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the only <span class="Italic">guṇātīta</span> position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> But these, qualities are the test of that man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> After he attains that, these qualities are the test of that man, how we can test that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, testing, that is also stated. Just like these Europeans, Americans, in their previous position, they had many bad habits. But somehow or other, they have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is their position, <span class="Italic">guṇātīta.</span> Even by habit they commit something mistake, that is not to be taken into account. Because... Just hear. Just like a fan is moving, and make the switch off. So the switch is off. That is first consideration. And after the switch being off, the fan is moving, that is no consideration. Do you understand? Because the fan was in force, so you, although you have made the switch off, still moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> Still moving, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not to be taken into account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> That is not to be... Yes, correct. Because old, past actions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> Understood that the wheel has to move.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> And will stop soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That... Because the switch is now off, it will stop. <span class="Italic">Śaśvad bhavati dharmātmā. Śaśvad bhavati dharmātmā.</span> Because he has taken to the shelter of Kṛṣṇa, therefore his all past business is finished. Although, due to past habit, sometimes you find some mistake, it is not to be taken. Because this thing will go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> This thing will go. That is a part of past actions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very soon. Yes. Very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> Because that wheel has to move and it will stop of its own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śaśvad bhavati...</span> What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Śaśvad bhavati dharmātmā.</span> That?</div>

That one Australian <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> So this rascal may speak something, but we cannot stop our movement. You see? Our movement is increasing, all over the world in, in spite of all criticism. We don't care for that. Because we know that we are following the footsteps of predecessor <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> that's all right. We don't mind. And actually, it is happening. Otherwise, within six, seven years, so much progress could not be possible. [break] What is the word, exact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai and Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ārambha! Ārambha. Ārambha.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Beginning. That's right. Beginning of work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no beginning. Just like it is already taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so why should he take something else, begin here. That should continue.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ārambhar</span> means this <span class="Italic">ārambha.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ārambha</span> means beginning. So it is already began, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> On these... These <span class="Italic">ārambha-parityāgī.</span> You don't take any, any cognizance of these works being done by the body. I think, that is to my mind, the exact meaning. I have not been able to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I have already explained. If you have taken seriously Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so something happening due to my past habit, you should not take care of it. It will subside.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the final conclusion of... Final conclusion, that if anyone has taken devotional service seriously, <span class="Italic">avyabhicāriṇi, avyabhicāriṇi. Avyabhicāriṇi</span> means as instructed by the spiritual master. If one takes this business very seriously, and he's executing that, then he's <span class="Italic">guṇātīta.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Sanskrit)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not... Just hear. It is very important point, that <span class="Italic">jyoti,</span> it must come through some source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> <span class="Italic">Jyoti</span> has, <span class="Italic">jyoti</span> has to come through source, correct.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Amṛta.</span> Brahman. That is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> So the Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, they are, these, one and the same. But it is the person's realization. Now, common man, they can understand what is this sunshine, but they cannot know what is the sun globe, or what is within the sun globe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> What is within... Yes, correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So those who are satisfied only <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> their knowledge is not yet perfect.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...prajña.</span> This point must be clearly understood. Then you go further. A <span class="Italic">kṣetra...</span> This body is <span class="Italic">kṣetra. Kṣetra</span> means "the field of activities." Just like a <span class="Italic">kṛṣana</span> works in his field, and he reaps his result. As he works, he gets the result. Similarly, this body is <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> and we are working with this body. And we are reaping the result. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇa daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.

And next He says that "I am also <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña.</span> I am also <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña.</span>" How He's <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña?</span> Because He's Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's the presiding...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore... Therefore there are two <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñas:</span> one, the <span class="Italic">jīvātmā,</span> and one, the Paramātmā. The Māyāvādīs do not accept it. They say the only <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaḥ. Jivātmā</span> and Paramātmā the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> <span class="Italic">Dvau suparṇā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is confirmed by the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> <span class="Italic">Dvau suparṇā</span> are there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two birds, two birds. Yes. Two birds. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is clearly said. <span class="Italic">Anumantā upadraṣṭā.</span> One <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña</span> is <span class="Italic">anumantā</span> and <span class="Italic">upadraṣṭā;</span> another <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña</span> is not <span class="Italic">anumantā.</span> He's simply enjoying.</div>

Those who are in the Vaikuṇṭha world, spiritual world, they are all liberated souls. And those who are within this material world, they are conditioned souls. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When I read...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, let us finish. So this should be clearly understood, that in this body the both the Paramātmā and <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Stay together, live together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But the Māyāvādīs, they says there is no <span class="Italic">jīvātmā.</span> The same thing, Paramātmā. That is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those two birds are living on the same tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference. That is the difference. Paramātmā and <span class="Italic">jīvātmā,</span> what is the difference? Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> I... This is very practical, that I am the <span class="Italic">jīvātmā.</span> I am living in this body. I know the business of my body, pains and pleasures, but I do not know what is the pains and pleasures of your body. You also do not know what is the pains and pleasures... Therefore we are individual. But Paramātmā, because He's there, He knows what is your pains and pleasure, what is my pains and pleasure. Not only you, but all living entities. That is Paramātmā. So those who are falsely claiming that "I am Paramātmā," this is the test: whether you are cognizant of everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you cannot falsely claim that "I am Paramātmā," or "I am God." Whether you have got this all-pervading knowledge? This is the only test to the pretenders that he is God, he is Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that is... They will say that <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña,</span> not <span class="Italic">kṣetra. Mahā-bhūtāny ahaṅkāro buddhir avyaktam eva...</span></div>
