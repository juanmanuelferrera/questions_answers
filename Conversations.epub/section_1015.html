<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I was with him when he posted the letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I'll ask him when I see him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got any copy? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I didn't keep a copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they submit? Quarterly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Part of the money is contribution for construction of my house. Ten thousand. Ten thousand dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Ten thousand dollars I think. Jayatīrtha mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm writing one letter to the governor that I work hard, I print my books and they are selling, and if I bring the money to construct temple, why people are envious? What is the wrong there? Rather, I should be encouraged that I am bringing so much money in India, foreign exchange, by my hard labor. So why they are envious? Why... I have sent this to the governor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> To the governor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Governor, Mr. Chandra Reddy. "Why, wherefrom they are getting money, where, why?" That is my very, very hard labor, that's all. Is it wrong if a man works hard and gets money in foreign country and bring in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I think they cannot believe that a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> could have so much money from selling books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be beyond their dream, but I am not so-called <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> I am trying to execute the orders of my Guru Mahārāja, predecessor. I am not a so-called <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> taking a saffron robe, begging for fulfilling the belly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They have to accept you as an international leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I must be international leader. Yes, they are surprised how... This is unique in the history, that a single person's books are sold in so many large quantities. I don't think any author has sold so many books. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> In some of the American magazines they publish a best-seller list of books, and the number of books we sell goes beyond the best-seller list.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And especially philosophical and religious books. These people do not touch. (laughs) Untouchable. Has even Vivekananda has presented so many books? A small book, "Thus spake..." And what he will write? What does he know? Simply bluffers. <span class="Italic">Chaliots.(?)</span> Our Bon Mahārāja is also one of the <span class="Italic">chaliots.</span> What is the English for <span class="Italic">chaliot</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Bluffers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It means he has no assets but he shows that he is very big. That is called <span class="Italic">chaliot.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Bluffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bluffer? Our Tīrtha Mahārāja's Caitanya Research Institute. Here is an Indian Institute for... What is that? Bon Mahārāja's? Institute for Indian Culture and Philosophy. But where is your book? You have seen that Tīrtha Mahārāja's one book? <span class="Italic">The Vedānta as Caitanya Has Seen,</span> like that. And he has given a picture of himself with effulgence on his head. You have seen that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, I have not seen that one. In all the <span class="Italic">mandiras</span> where his picture is there, they have all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas'</span> pictures, but only his picture has the effulgence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such a rascal. He has given Prabhupāda's picture, no effulgence. His picture, effulgence. He's such a rascal. Publicly he's showing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But unfortunately that had to be painted in. He could not just show...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's no natural...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Could not illuminate. Remain in darkness. Effulgence in darkness. And such a shameless man. He is giving effulgence in the picture. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...see that this society is replacing the Ramakrishna Mission there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We can see practically that this society, your society, is replacing this Ramakrishna Mission more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why Ramakrishna Mission? We are far above the Ramakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. As far as the people go. They are all saying Hare Kṛṣṇa and... They don't even mention... Sometimes they ask us, "Do you know who Ramakrishna is?" And we say, "No, we have never heard of him." They go, "You have not heard of Ramakrishna?" We say, "No. We only know Prabhupāda and Lord Caitanya. Everybody knows that, and nobody knows who is Ramakrishna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They do not know what to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Then they don't know what to say. They say, "You mean you don't know that Chicago Address?" We say, "No. What? Oh, when Prabhupāda went for <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā</span>? Yes, that we know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Chicago Address was the worst. He is defying, "Why you give credit to God?" This is the... We have seen that Chicago Address. Now they are eliminating. Most blasphemous. One Christian priest, he was surprised, "What kind of nonsense these Indians are..." He asked him, "How you are speaking in this way, 'Why you are giving credit to God?' " He said like that, "You are working, why you are giving credit to God?" This is Vivekananda's realization. And he created God, a illiterate priest, he become God. Because he said, "I am God." That is the proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because he said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I am God. I am the same Rāma, same Kṛṣṇa." Therefore his name is Ramakrishna. He was Gadadhar Chatterji, and he said to his disciple, Vivekananda, first-class rogue, that, "I am the same Rāma, same Kṛṣṇa." So he took it. This is evidence. Because Kṛṣṇa says "I am the Supreme." So he said, "I am the same Rāma, same Kṛṣṇa." This is the evidence. If Kṛṣṇa can say, he can say also. This institution is the most harmful institution for Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> At one town, Beturhari, that, it is called Nakashiparathana. That's about thirty miles north of Māyāpura. One day in advance they advertised that we were coming and we were having a public showing of the cinema and Nitāi-Gaura <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> And they had one <span class="Italic">maidan</span> called Library Maidan. There was one, like, one stage there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is in West Bengal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> West Bengal. That's in Nadia district. Just before Pulasi, south of Pulasi. And when we came there and I saw the police in the afternoon, we told them we were going to have a function. So they said that they would send a few policemen. They said that "We will send some policemen for keeping the order." But that night so many people came the space could only hold four thousand. But another two, three thousand people came, and they were turned away because of insufficient space. So they were standing on the wall and on the rooftops all around, and all you could see were people's heads, just like an ocean. The policemen, after it was over... When I chanted, I chanted, "Everyone please chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." And I chanted the full <span class="Italic">mantra</span> three times. They chanted so loud that even two, three blocks away people thought that the heavens were shouting. It was like a thunder...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thunderbolt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Thunderbolt. And the policemen said that never-even the chief minister came here once-not even half so many people came, and that was announced for one week. This was announced for one day and more people came than ever before. He said, "This really shows me that the people are hungry for spiritual answer. They have no one to lead them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And these leaders are simply envious, that's all. The only reason why they're not helping us is because they're envious. Because so many people are interested and no one is interested in them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, our <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> is selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. When we stopped at Burdwan, in one place, one boy sold 198 <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās, </span><i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>, without moving. So many <span class="Italic">Gītās...</span> People were just crowding around taking <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> so much that the local... There were some bookstores. They also came and they said that "We cannot get wholesale? We have never seen such a book sell so well."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Even people come to the temple in Calcutta, they want ten, fifteen copies. Village people. Poor people. They come and say, "<i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>, where is that? I have heard." And they take ten or fifteen copies, they wrap it in their cloth and bring it to the village. It is becoming very popular. Wherever you go, "Where is this <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I went to Writer's Building, I had four or five copies with me. I didn't go for selling. I went to see ministers. But all the peons, they were buying the <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>s from me. I sold out. People were coming up with rupees saying, <span class="Italic">"</span><i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>." I didn't have any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Out of their own accord they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, they've heard of it. It's becoming famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's our inspiration, that if we can make <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> and Your Divine Grace famous all over Bengal, then we will feel that our mission...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I could not write any... I wrote some Bengali book, that is now... It can be collected from Devānanda Gauḍīya Maṭha. I continually wrote one book, <span class="Italic">Bhagavāner Kathā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> People are begging us for books in Bengali written by Your Divine Grace. We tell them that... There's no time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Subhaga translated. But his translations are not so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. There's always trouble with translation in local languages, Hindi or Gujarati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. And they do the wrong words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now they have a... I put a two-man team. A two- or three-man team. Subhaga, there's one boy Kiśora, and Tatpur. Between the three of them they check and recheck.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tatpur is educated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's got a B.A. or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He doesn't write himself. He writes in old fashion. But he corrects for double-checking philosophy. Editing. And this Kiśora, he was a M.A. and he previously used to write. He was an honor student at Calcutta University, and he used to freelance write in Bengali. So his style is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not engage him in simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He is translating now our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That's all he does.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That and he greets the guests. He's also good at membership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> has become popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. That name has become very popular. Everyone is asking, "Where is this <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can register the name so that others may not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, otherwise they'll cash in on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can register it the name. Patron registration. Copyright registration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It says it in the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It says, but you should make sure it's registered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Gopāla, he printed it. I don't know if he had it registered. It says in the book, "All Rights Reserved."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your statement. But it must be legally protected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They may check up and find out not so and then do it. That <span class="Italic">Bhagavāner Kathā</span> was printed in what book? Do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got a paper-<span class="Italic">Gauḍīya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> These books that Gaura-Govinda, he wants to get printed. How do we know what is being said? I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the... One Orrian gentleman will come and get him to read this book. Then I can understand where he stands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because he has... <span class="Italic">The Topmost Yoga</span> is ready, but I didn't want to print that yet until...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. I'll... After hearing this book I'll let him know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> After they write everything, then I also read it in Bengali. I can... And if I see something that seems a little impersonal or something, I say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Correct it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, correct it. That much I can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impersonal idea is in everyone's head. "God has no legs, no head. Simply he has got head."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I can also write to the... Previously in 1971-72 at the <span class="Italic">pandals</span> you used to speak in Bengali some days. I'll write for those tapes. We can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, those tapes. I asked for those tapes so long ago. If we can get those Hindi and Bengali tapes we could have them transcribed, and they can make very good essays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> All the big English <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> articles are actually your lectures simply transcribed. So we could transcribe those tapes and we could have originally your words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. There were ten days when Prabhupāda spoke in Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Twice. Once in Deshapriya Park and once at Maidan. Even today people talk about both festivals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavāner Kathā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavāner Kathā. </span>Devānanda Gauḍīya Maṭha<span class="Italic">.</span> Paper of <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya</span> it was published continuous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> What years we should look? More or less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 1950 or little before that. They have got their old <span class="Italic">Gauḍīyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They must have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were so popular, the report was that the readers of <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya</span> were only hankering after that <span class="Italic">Bhagavāner Kathā,</span> and after reading that they will throw away. Other articles, they were not interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So always your writing, people were attracted by.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a fact. Even my teachers were attracted in school days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Recently that..., some professor said that you are the veritable incarnation of Vyāsadeva for Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Some have said like that. In my matriculation class I wrote some essay and I got out of 100, 85 marks. But the teacher came to the class, "Who has written this?" So I stood up, and he thanked me, "Yes, it is very nice." He especially came to thank me for that essay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> At least from the human standpoint, it is not humanly possible to have so many books in such a short time. There is no other author, at least that we know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I showed your "As Brilliant as the Sun" to Tarun Kanti Gosh and one other minister, and when they saw that, then after, for ten minutes, all they could say was how Prabhupāda, how he is empowered by Lord Gaurāṅga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They said like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. That's a good movie because it simply shows how you are doing so many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We also showed that to that Atul Krishna Goswami. He came to Māyāpura. When he saw that he was so..., that movie, they had never seen such a thing, the process of printing the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has good idea about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He has translated <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> in Hindi, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He presented me one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Many people ask that if the <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> could be put in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> This Gītā Press, they have these little books selling for one rupee, and they've sold <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> If we can put <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> into many languages, it will be bigger than this Gītā Press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can... It is poetry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's the difference, that Prabhupāda put it in poetry. Who has got that inspiration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is <span class="Italic">gān, gītā,</span> song. One can chant it singing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Some people say, "We want the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> This is only <span class="Italic">gān.</span>" But then we have to say, "No, this has got the full <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Everything is there. Every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> is in here. Only put in <span class="Italic">gān</span> form. But it is actual <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span>" Other people say, "I have so many <span class="Italic">Gītās.</span>" We say, "No, no, you can chant this with your harmonium or by <span class="Italic">khol</span> and <span class="Italic">karatāla</span> you can sing." So many ways the people are taking it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they can sing very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When we can hear over the loudspeakers <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> being sung, then we will feel very happy. When the public will start singing publicly <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Public singing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When the public began to recite <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> at their functions, like they're doing this Tulasīdāsa <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> if they start that in Bengal, <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>, then it will be a big success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tulasīdāsa. Tulasīdāsa <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> is very popular. Because the Hindis, they have no literature. There is no literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> If some Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava could rewrite that according to <span class="Italic">siddhānta,</span> then it would be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> His <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> has got many philosophical errors in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> If a Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava could write that properly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava has immense literature. Why they should bother with Tulasīdāsa? By reading Tulasīdāsa's <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa</span> in my experience I've not seen a single man has come to the spiritual platform. I have not seen a single man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That is not transcendental literature. Because by reading these books you come to transcendental realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is wanted. They want <span class="Italic">āśīrvāda.</span> Just like so many people come, <span class="Italic">āśīrvāda.</span> "You are a saintly person, you give me <span class="Italic">āśīrvāda</span> so my material happiness may increase. I am not interested with the spiritual knowledge. Give me blessing so that for nothing I get, upgrade my material opulence." This is their... So those Tulasīdāsa readers, they are like that. They want material opulence. <span class="Italic">Ārto-arthārthī, arthārthī,</span> want some material benefit. They chant Tulasīdāsa's <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita-mānasa</span> for some material benefit. They're not interested in the spiritual advancement. Nobody. That Delhi temple where they have <span class="Italic">paṇḍita?</span> I'm forgetting his name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> One <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> in Delhi? That one <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> is there. The one whom you stayed with that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇadāsa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I just met him once. Tejas brought him. He's got some <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> Some <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> or something. <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that Prabhākāra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Ācārya Prabhākāra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Prabhākāra is different. Prabhākāra was first initiated by me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Your first disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Hari-nāma-mantra</span> he was given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> What year was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 1954 I think. He did some service. In Jhansi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> You had that League. I saw photos of that. That League of Devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. A very nice building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That was nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> With front wall and you had painted "League of Devotees."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I have seen the photo. Big place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That is still existing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very big place. That you have seen this Keśavajī Gauḍīya Maṭha in Mathurā? No. There is Caitanya Mahāprabhu Deity. That Deity was there. When I closed that I brought that big, big <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and delivered them, they will show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> One man cheated you there? Some land? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The building belonged to a big <span class="Italic">zamindar.</span> So Prabhākāra arranged. So it was to be given to me, and I wanted to start the League of Devotees from there. So I spent some money, whatever money I had, and it was going on. But in the meantime, this Lilavati Munshi, Mrs. At that time she was wife of the governor. Her husband, K. M. Munshi. She had some organization of foreign women. So somehow or other she got imagination that "This house is very nice." She was governor's wife. So it was not given to me rightly, but I was using. So she wanted that house. Through collector and through all government officials pressure. She wrote me later on, that "Bhaktivedantajī, you wanted to organize, but you could not. But I have got this institution. Why not give it to me?" So, of course, there were many lawyer friends. They advised me that "You do not give up. You should litigate." So I thought, "Who is going to litigate? Let me go to Vṛndāvana." So I left. So at Mathurā I delivered the Deity to this Keśavajī Gauḍīya Maṭha, and I made my place in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> You had such a hard struggle in the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because that place, I saw in the photo, everything was there. Nice big sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was a very good place. This Prabhākāra helped me. Ninety percent was... But if I did not leave, nobody could drive me, that was a fact. But I thought "Who is going to..., for litigation? She is the governor's wife, and she is pressing through collectors, through..." The manager who was in charge, he had some cinema house. So they had to renew the license, cinema house. And the collector pressed him that "Unless you arrange for this house, we are not going to renew your license." I thought, "Unnecessarily this man will be in trouble. I'll have to pay so many rupees, and she is governor's wife." And that lady came to me in Bombay several times. "You take my press. You have got so many publications." So I said "I can take your press. I have got money. But what shall I do with it? It is letter press. Now printing is done by offset." That press, Associated Press, is very good press. It was... They got so many government contracts. The whole telephone guides were printed there. But because it is letterset press, it is costly. The government got offset press, cheaper price. So that contract was cancelled. So for her nefarious activity she is punished. Her husband died. She has no more importance, and she was one of the trustees of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. So she was exempted. Now she's an ordinary woman. Press is not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> All they have is that <span class="Italic">Bhavan's Journal.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Nobody reads that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You say she was kicked out from the trusteeship. She's not part of that any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The other trustees said that "You are simply spending. What you are doing?" After all, when she was wife of the governor she had some prestige. Otherwise... She invited me in that Juhu, she has got a house in Juhu. So I told her, "Yes, I can purchase your press. Fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> is not a very big amount for me, but what shall I do? We are printing offset." That is the cause... Because nowadays printing is done by offset press, she lost all business. People got big, big contract, they got cheaper and better quality. Why they should stick to that press? And government contract was taken from them, big, huge business they lost. Tata Press, they have got offset. Government transferred there. And that was her main support. It was a nice, good press. Practically best press in Bombay, Associated Press. But because it is letter press... Now to maintain the letter press is very costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. You have to get new type every year, and that is very costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays there is no need of letters, I mean to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Type. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...on all the equipment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That is not so much for the amount of books that they have been able to produce in such a short time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can produce one book daily, the machines are so expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They do outside work as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> What for? We have unlimited...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Botheration. You have to satisfy your customer, waste time. We keep our machine for our own work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We have so many books. As soon as we print a new book, the previous book is out of print. We have to print again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The first machine introduced by you, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, the mimeograph. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then other machines came. I did not know, but I was thinking that if some typist would hear my tapes and type, I was thinking like that. Expert typist. Formerly, it was being done like that. Here, tape recorder. You hear something and then type. Like that. And this machine, you shall, it is, automatically, you hear and type, hear and type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This is made for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the advancement on that idea, dictaphone. Telephone. And the dictation of the author. He's hearing and typing. Nowadays everyone is using. The doctors dictate prescription. The doctor, instead of sending note, he dictates for such and such patient, "He should receive this, take like that..." That is recorded. Another, another, and immediately taken and the compounder hears and... No writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Actually you are dictating the prescription for the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt.</span> And prescription is so sweet it pleases the ear and the heart. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt.</span> It is medicine for this material disease. At the same time it is so pleasing to the ear and the heart. This is the very word. <span class="Italic">Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra. Śrotra</span> means aural. <span class="Italic">Śrotra-manaḥ,</span> and mind. <span class="Italic">Mano 'bhirāmāt. Abhirāma,</span> pleasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> After rainy season you'll be coming to Māyāpura then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We'll write when the weather improves. We'll write when the rains cease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
