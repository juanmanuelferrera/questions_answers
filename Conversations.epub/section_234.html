<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Now in Vṛndāvana here is one temple... There is likely that they cannot (indistinct for several minutes) Suppose everything is (indistinct). Therefore accepting (indistinct) how to manage. This is between ourself. Suppose if Bharatpur Mahārāja (indistinct).  In this temple also, I am making (indistinct) decision. (break) ...is not in favor of any of the parties. So if it also comes in our hands, it has to be (indistinct). Now, supposing you have got three, then how you shall manage? Simply taking over is no good. Because they are giving, means they cannot manage. That property is very valuable property, Bharatpur place. So they are thinking of giving it over to us because it is not being managed. (indistinct) position is here. So up to now we are strong. But if our, what is called, cooperation becomes slack, then our temple also the same thing will be. That, the (indistinct) that I am staying here for the last ten or twelve years and paying, but the property belongs to the Deity. And there are (indistinct) sevaites. Sometimes somebody starts noting that you neglect sometimes somebody takes money in advance. So what is my position? (indistinct) the rentor may decide what is my position. Actually, in terms of the rentor, I am tenant for these two rooms, and that also. (indistinct) Of course, I have got many (indistinct). But it is sentiment. We (indistinct) these things. This is criminal arrangement(?). Suppose when you the management of all these, how we shall manage?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Not only how, but who.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Not how, as well as who. Because how is not... (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The mouse are afraid of cats. So they held a meeting (indistinct). Then the resolution was passed that let there be a bell in the neck of the cat fixed up, so that when he is coming the bell will ring and we shall know, "Now he is coming." Immediately it was passed. The first resolution was passed. Then how to bell, who will go to bell? Because anyone who will go to bell the cat, he will be devoured. So the plan-making that this will be managed like this, there is a resolution, bells, fixing of a bell. Now go in and fix up the bell.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> It seems that Bhavānanda prabhu is the best manager.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Manager anyone can become, but manpower... We have no Indian members chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>So how much men we shall import? And whether it is feasible by importing men to manage this facility?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Now, there seems to be a surplus of men in Bombay, from all the reports I've gotten. So some could come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>But...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>If we remain here and attract foreigners to come...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> The manpower will come from them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Not only visitors (indistinct), those who are spiritually inclined. In that way we may get opportunity.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The other point is that when we manage these things, there are many <i class="calibre3">guṇḍās </i>in Vṛndāvana. They will try to create some trouble. Just like yesterday. You were present? This boy was fighting with one man. You were not present?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> No. What time was it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>When the minister came.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>I was not here at that time.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Tried to pick up quarrel. (break) You have not met?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes, I have met him. At Janmāṣṭamī two years ago at New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa: </b>He is coming in the third shift.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa:</b> They will... Girirāja and Bhavānanda and them, they will probably be in the third shift ,depending on how the land deal goes, whether it is settled by them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>It must be settled. Not (indistinct). Therefore, I have asked so many people to go there. It must be settled.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa:</b> The last situation I had heard was that everybody was agreeable, that Nair himself was agreeable and that everything was proceeding, but it was in the hands of the Municipality and that was going so slow, and that Nair himself, he is saying so many dubious things on the outside, but in complete agreement once you step into a room with him. So we are not so much sure. It's more or less in the hands of the Municipality, but who knows what is going on behind the table. Something like that. (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Take a little breakfast?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>They said you wanted to see me?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh? Oh, about that typing. (break) How we have secured that house in London.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Oh, <i class="calibre3">jaya</i>! All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Berkshire Palace.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Berkshire Palace, (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Duke of Windsor's castle(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>He's the king there, right? The queen's husband.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>He was to be the king, but he rejected for that one common girl. So the ministry asked him that "You have to give up this girl or you have to give up your throne." So he preferred to give up his throne. And the present queen's father, his second brother, he was made king, King George VI. Otherwise, this Duke of Windsor... When he refused to become the king, he became the Duke of Windsor and he was given this Berkshire Palace.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>He also is the one who has the Windsor Palace?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, Windsor Palace is the queen's. That is some seasonal residence. This Buckingham Palace is office. Actually for residential palace, the Windsor Palace. Windsor Palace?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Windsor, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That Palace we see in passing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes, large palace.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Windsor.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Berkshire Palace is also nearby.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>It is nearer to John's Tittenhurst. What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Tittenhurst Park.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Tittenhurst Park. (To Sarasvatī:) Come on, come on. Come on. So Sarasvatī-devī, we have got good news: your father is coming tomorrow. It is all right? Śyāmasundara is coming tomorrow. You like?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> She says she has four fathers and mothers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Four fathers?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> And mothers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1): </b>Who are they?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Four fathers and four mothers?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Sarasvatī:</b> Four fathers and (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Śyāmasundara is coming tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Sarasvatī:</b> I told her.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>You have told her?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Sarasvati: </b>I told her that Śyāmasundara is coming very soon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Ohhhh, that's nice. (break) ...men Monday?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda: </b>We can send them but they won't go.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So if you can make somebody agree, then he is coming tomorrow or day after tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda:</b> But no one will agree to leave you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda: </b>Letter from the press regarding my songbook.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda: </b>So I don't know what to do. Nobody would like to go, to leave you. We would like to go, but we wouldn't want to miss your classes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>That is so.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>So you can make one condition, that if you return us, we can go at eight or nine, but you must return us by four. Then we can go. Make this condition. Instead of saying no, make some condition.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda:</b> It's the 29th?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda: </b>And he's coming tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>I have asked him to come day after tomorrow. He comes generally at about ten.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda: </b>But I heard that last year we went and it was not a very big function. (break) I wrote that letter to this Lalitānanda about this Jāhnavī...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda: </b>Jāhnavī <i class="calibre3">sampradāya</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Jāhnavī <i class="calibre3">sampradāya</i>? Oh, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda:</b> So they don't want to put it in <i class="calibre3">Back to Godhead </i>because I used the word infantile, naive, undereducated and incompetent and that's considered most ungentlemanly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2): </b>They do not like publishing (indistinct) articles.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda:</b> But Prabhupāda says fools and rascals and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> I have written so many articles in the past two years and one has been published in two years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>For <i class="calibre3">Back to Godhead</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2): </b><i class="calibre3">Back to Godhead,</i> yes. They say no one can understand them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Acyutānanda:</b> (indistinct) from Subala dāsa Mahārāja that they have received his letter on September 16th and I have requested Karandhara to send him one <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2): </b>Karandhara has already said no. (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation">(Prabhupāda converses in Hindi with guests) (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>...then I must agitate my mind either how to stop the intoxicant or how to get it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>And if we get the management of this temple, that will be triumph (indistinct) Vṛndāvana. It is the most important place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>And actually, the men who came yesterday, this Mr. Nath and some men who come regularly, they would like to see it , because they like this...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Mr. Nath?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>There is one man who comes every day. A Vṛndāvana resident.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>But the one thing, you know there is one physician?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Printer and physician, yes?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Printer also? He has published some <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta. </i>What is his name?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes, I know it. Hari Nama Press? The press is Hari Nama Press.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>His father's name. I gave him one set of books, <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata, </i>(indistinct). So you have to inquire from him whether it is sold (indistinct). (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Sudāmā Vipra Mahārāja has such reverence for Siddha Svarūpa, but the other students do not like that, because they think he is treating Siddha Svarūpa with respect when he should be treating you with respect. So naturally, the students love you and so they don't like that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>They do not like to give him extra...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Respect, at the expense of yourself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> There is no such thing. They will stop(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes, they are nice boys. Secondly, for some reason they don't like..., they like to cook themselves.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>They like to cook for themselves. They cook without spices and like that, because they are thinking of their health. I gave them... I know, I can... (break)</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> You have your choice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, no, it's a very nice place, undoubtedly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes. The nicest place in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>One of the nicest buildings. He had so many buildings in Vṛndāvana from his dynasty, but they have all been taken by unscrupulous <i class="calibre3">pūjārīs.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> They've been taken by unscrupulous <i class="calibre3">pūjārīs</i> that are just squatting illegally. And so he says, "All right, let them have it." But this one he has kept because it is so first class.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So we shall have to deal with this <i class="calibre3">pūjārī.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>This one...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Is nice?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Nice, and he jumps when the Mahārāja speaks. I don't think he will get rid of this <i class="calibre3">pūjārī.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>He is alone or he has got some associates?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Alone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>He is living with family?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Alone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Alone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>We will retain him in some way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, you retain him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>That is the system, that he stays there but we will do the <i class="calibre3">pūjārī</i> work.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Give him salary.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He is being paid?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>I think they must be.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Anyway, whatever he is being paid, we shall pay. (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>(indistinct) also knows it, because he announced to this chairman of the council that he will become the gardener and they will become the <i class="calibre3">pūjārīs</i>. So he is for that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>The poor man, unless he gets some income, he becomes (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>He is not renounced. So let him (indistinct). So when you are going to talk to the Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>I will be going today if he sends a car. Or if not, I think I will go tomorrow. But that means I cannot go to Delhi. But I don't think... I think Manasvi and Mr. Sarkar, the engineer, can handle this deal. It's just to see if they can give another allotment.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not that everywhere you have to go. You go to the important business.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>So which do you think is more important-this deal or the palace? I think the palace.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Anyone can purchase. But to get the palace it requires great tactful dealing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Subala Mahārāja and I are going to Mathurā today to find out the position what they have done in relationship to this sanction, written sanction.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>From Mathurā, then go to Bharatpur.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>From Mathurā, Bharatpur is near.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>I think there is train or bus.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>There is bus, train. But the thing is, he may be sending a car here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>So I am getting a message from that boy who wrote the article, with the moustache. The boy who wrote the article, he has gone to Bharatpur with that note.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Oh. He is very good boy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Keep him as our friend. Give him nice food, <i class="calibre3">prasādam.</i> He is intelligent. He can see that <i class="calibre3">āratik</i>, very nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>He has been coming since the beginning. Since we first came he has been coming.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>So keep him as good friend.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>I try to do that with everyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Especially he is very nicely inclined. He is married or not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>(indistinct) what does he do?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> He lives with his father, and he goes to Bon Mahārāja University.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>For education? Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> But I asked him, "Do they teach any spiritual philosophy there," and he said no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>There is no spiritual philosophy. It is an academic, ordinary college. People understand that where is the credit, there are so many colleges. Responsible people, they understand that I am doing much more valuable thing. So what is the use of these schools and colleges? That (indistinct) school, college is not very good. And there are so many schools and colleges. That is not a very extraordinary thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Now I understand that Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, that school is not teaching spiritual philosophy. I told many people that if we got the chance to open a university, we would not compromise. We would not do anything with the government if they restricted our curriculum...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>...without spiritual... Without spiritual it is void.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What do they say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> They think. Then I say, "You can teach all the subjects and also teach the spiritual. "</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>If we organize our Bombay, then we shall regularly teach all the students from the very beginning. And in London also we shall. London, Dallas. So that these students will be transferred. Their parents will be very glad that our students have gone to foreign countries for study. We shall have very, very good sympathy(?). Our only policy will be the students should be taught very nice English for understanding our books.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>In Bombay rather than Māyāpur?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>In Bombay rather than...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Everywhere. Everywhere. But you make higher study, higher study, higher study.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>Māyāpur can be the highest.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct), or everywhere this existence(?) should be lower class, higher class. But our all institutions should be for giving spiritual. We have got so many books. Simply he has to learn English and Sanskrit, that's all.

And they will take you anywhere, nobody will know. Just like even a great person, Kruschev, nobody knows his whereabouts. It is a very dangerous government. But as they are advertising, people are not happy. Moscow city is nice, but it is old constructed. The same Communistic government has not done anything.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I don't think there is any vegetarian, because in the store you will get only meat. There is no vegetable, no fruit. Śyāmasundara had to spend two hours for collecting food. There is no rice, (indistinct), nothing. For vegetarians it is very, very difficult to live in Moscow.</div>

And still the little night, that is just like dusk; it is not completely dark. And laborer class... (speaks to someone in Hindi) Keep it open. (break) (indistinct) Every corner of the street, Lenin's picture. All books are sold, they are Lenin. No other literature. You cannot get taxi. Poor men, they cannot pay for taxi. Very little number. When I was talking with Professor Kotovsky, so I asked him, "Now we shall go. Get me taxi." So he, "Yes, it is Moscow." So he got down, he personally showed me, "Instead of taking taxi waiting, please go in this way when you go to your hotel." He showed me shortcut. People are walking, and they are running for the bus. It is not at all a rich country. A poor country. And if you see the shops, you will find old (indistinct), just like antique shop.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa:</b> I have experienced that directly in India, Prabhupāda, because I'm working with these merchants all the time, and the government is nationalizing and taking over one industry after another. They took over the control of flour, they took over the control of sugar, they've already got rice, then they took over the exportation of textiles. And I say, "Don't you have anything in your Constitution to prevent this?" They said, "No. We have voted in the government for six years; they can do as they like. The only way is to wait six years and vote them out again. But there is no provision..."</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>There is more supply than demand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> Than demand, yes. That is the problem there: what to do with the stuff that you have got and that you are producing. That's an economic problem.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa:</b> Not just supply, quality. When you buy an orange and you have a glass of orange juice, it's orange, it's not yellow. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> But by their lack of demand, we are reaping a harvest.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>She said it is not around the corner, we are amidst it now. So it's very obvious.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man: </b>We are in the midst of it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>That is what she said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa:</b> Even the optimistic merchants and people you talk to, I say, "It is Communist government?"

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pañca-draviḍa:</b> Rava or something, a particular notation on the calendar, it corresponds to March or April, r-a something.

They have already taken over the control of <i class="calibre3">atta</i> and flour and now <i class="calibre3">suji. </i>They want to take over the control of wheat and the control of sugar completely. So all these things we are seeing is what they are doing, they are taking over control, they are rationing the items, but in the ration shop you can get 800 grams of the product and then you have to go out onto the market and buy at outrageous prices, because nobody can feed a family on 800 grams of sugar a month. It's very little for five people. The price of sugar has gone up over a rupee and a half since the government took over.</div>

I've been thinking that how you have presented this ISKCON movement as an assembly of devotees all over the world so they don't even have to go to the holy places.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>They must prove by analysis, by chemical analysis. There is difference between the modern scientist and our process of understanding.</div>

So I questioned, "Where is your department of technology to understand the difference between dead body and living body?" So I spoke on this. So the students appreciated.

Science is simply based on this bodily concept. <i class="calibre3">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 10.84.13]<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
