<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I don't know their names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They have those in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not this red, but bluish color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But of the same kind, having bunch of hair. [break] ...three hundred varieties of birds. How many one has seen? One million. <span class="Italic">Pakṣiṇam dāsa-lakṣakam. Dāsa-lakṣakam</span> means one million. [break] ...varieties of life, so many varieties of planets, sky, the sea, ocean, the mountains, the rivers, and they want to compete with God. Just see their foolishness.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...animals. The animals... You keep the animals here, and take one of them, slaughter-they will think, "I am safe." This is animal. All of them will think, "Oh, I am safe. He is being taken. That's all." This is their dull brain, the modern animals. [break]...<span class="Italic">dvī-pada-paśuḥ.</span> These two-legged animals, they will think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say that if you have a herd of sheep and one, the first part of the herd falls off of a cliff, then all the rest of them will simply walk off the cliff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is called <span class="Italic">veriya dāsan.</span> In Hindi, <span class="Italic">veriya dāsan.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> What is that called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Veriya dāsan.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> What does that mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">veri</span> means lamb or sheep. Their walk... If you can push one of them in the slaughterhouse, all of them enter. This is called <span class="Italic">veriya dāsan.</span> You haven't got to endeavor to push others. You just push one only. "Fut, fut, fut, fut, fut, fut, fut," they all enter. (Laughter) In Hindi it is called <span class="Italic">veriya dāsan.</span> Just cheat one <span class="Italic">veri,</span> and all others will be followers. [break] Long ago, when we were boys, we saw one comic cinema. That old cinema player was... His name was Max Linder. Max Linder. So this Max Linder was going to a ball dance, and he was waiting in the park, and the ball dance coat, you know? It has got a tail. So he was sitting in a bench, and some naughty boys came and they nailed the tailing part. So when he got up it became torn, like... So his, this hip was visible. So when was dancing in the ball others were seeing his, "What is this?" (laughter) So he went to the mirror, he saw, "Oh?" So he began to dance and show everyone like this. So others said, "What is this?" "This is the latest fashion. This is the latest fashion in ball dancing." "Oh?" Then all cut their tail coat. You see? "The latest fashion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's how they got the cut now. There's a cut in the coat in the back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the <span class="Italic">veriya dāsan.</span> [break] ...taken the story from the Aesop's, no, <span class="Italic">Hitopadeśa. Laṅguli-hīna śṛgala,</span> a jackal without tail. So this is the world. Any nonsense you do and if you say, "It is the latest fashion," everyone will do. The miniskirt. One girl made it, so all girl. The <span class="Italic">veriya</span> not only amongst the sheeps, and the so-called animal sheeps also do that, human sheeps. [break] ...very deep there, the water?
