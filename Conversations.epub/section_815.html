<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...met recently our Lalitā Cācā? You did not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lalitā, Lalitā, Lalitā Ṭhākura or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Lalitā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Lalitā Prasāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh, huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> In Birnagara, no. Jayapatākā has been there, but I haven't been there in years. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...moon is hot, they say, because the shade of the earth is obstructing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say that the sun is hitting like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? The sun is there, and the earth is there. How it becomes...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The earth is bet.... The earth is between the sun and the moon. Therefore there's some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, in between.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no. They say that the sun's rays are striking it, only half. The other half is in shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that shadow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Night. Like nighttime on the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Shadow. Like a ball. If I have a ball and shine a light on it, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no. Shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...this side will be in shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shadow.... "Shadow" means earthly shadow? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No no, no. Its own shadow. If this is a ball, and the light is coming from here, see, this portion will be in darkness or shadow. And the other portion will reflect light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's not the modern theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right? Explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Sounds all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They say." What you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We don't know anything. After meeting you, we wonder if we know anything, because we thought the moon was going around the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What shadow is that? The moon casts its own shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They, their explanation is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Half the moon is in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yeah, the back side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The back side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> The back side of the moon. That's what we're seeing now. The sun's here, hitting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can understand now. That means moon. Moon is.... A portion is bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Half of it is always bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. The part that's facing the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> But this is less than half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when they go to the moon planet, they go to the dark side. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> No, they say they go to the light side, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, they say the dark side is so cold that no one can.... Because there's no sunlight, it is so cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they have no experience of all the sides of the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, they don't. They only have one side, experiencing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, so what is the cause of the brightness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> The sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have brought some dust, but this is not bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say it's reflected light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. What is the material that makes it so bright so that whole universe is illuminated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There's no comment on that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> They don't know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have brought some dust, but that is not bright. They have said.... The other scientists, they said, "This kind of dust can be available here." Just see. Now, how it is bright?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Well, they say that from space the earth would be bright also, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The nonsense may say anything. But our common sense that if the, there is some ingredient in this moon which makes it bright, so they have brought the dust, but other scientists say that this dust can be available here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So it may be cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Actually, they have not proved anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my contention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say the moon is bright, just like if a cloud is in the sky, it appears very white and bright because the sun is hitting it. But the same cloud, if you bring it into the room, it's just mist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But cloud is not always existing. But this brightness is always existing. Cloud is sometimes appearing, sometimes disappearing. The moon brightness is regular. How you can compare with cloud? When you compare, there must be consistency. Analogy. Analogy means similar position. Otherwise, analogy has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Here's Jayapatākā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! [break].... Our Lalitā Cācā wants to do? You met him recently?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh. So his point is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Does he want to do something or simply speculate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He says that he wants to do something and so does some of his people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But he has a committee. He has a society. One Mr. Bhattacarya, who is a lawyer, and this Śacīnandana, who is a clerk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that's all right. What they want to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But they never.... We never spoke to those people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have told him that "Whatever you want to give us, give us. If you cannot give us, give us in lease. You remain your proprietor, but give us in lease, and we develop it." But he has never replied that. What does he want to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Before he finalized once, he said he wanted to speak to you once more. But never was the thing actually discussed in detail with Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was discussed. And he agreed, "Yes," but his man has different idea. So if you think that he's serious, we can go today sometime. How long it takes by car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It takes about an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But actually it's on the route to Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So we can.... But that will be very hastily. That.... The road is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That.... The road to his place is all right. There's a shortcut from Krishnagara; if that's taken, then for a while, one kilometer, there's <span class="Italic">kacā</span> road. After that, there's very, there's clear road with no traffic. Otherwise, if we.... We normally take that in the vans and in the jeep. We save about half an hour. But that way you have to go through one mile of <span class="Italic">kacā</span> road. Otherwise, if you go by all <span class="Italic">pākā</span> road, then it's a good road. Just takes a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we shall go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> ...little longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't matter. We shall go by the <span class="Italic">pākā.</span> <span class="Italic">Kacā </span> road may damage the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that today or tomorrow, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. On the way to Calcutta, talking will not be very serious because we'll be busy to go fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We'd be in a hurry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. Yes. [break] So what is the use of such men? Why he's keeping these men? They cannot do anything. He gets some pension. Who spends that money? But they are not doing anything. So what is the meaning of this count?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He admits that many times he has told some of them to leave their family life and take up some preaching, but they don't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they'll do it? They do not know how to preach, neither they are trained up. That means it is his disqualification. He could not train them how to preach. Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He was training Haridāsa Ṭhākura, Nityānanda, "Go there. Preach there. Do that." My Guru Mahārāja was doing that. But he has no power. He cannot do it. He simply talks that he is a very confidential devotee. That's all. He cannot preach. Otherwise Prabhupāda developed this Māyāpura, and he could not do anything. That means he has no power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He should have developed that place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He simply talks of big, big words. In the beginning, Prabhupāda had no committee, nothing of the sort. That he'll not admit, that he has no power to do so. He's simply thinks that he's very confidential son of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. That's his.... [break] ...nobody has seen his chief disciple? He lives in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yeah, he's not actually a <span class="Italic">bābājī.</span> He's <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, but he lives like a <span class="Italic">bābājī</span> dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I don't know anyone lives by <span class="Italic">bābājī...</span> He wears <span class="Italic">dhotī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Śacīnandana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh, Śacīnandana. So he.... I have seen several times. He's like <span class="Italic">bābājī,</span> but what he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's a clerk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's a clerk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Clerk. And he's the chief man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's a secretary. They have lawyer also, but he is the treasurer or something. I've only met with Śacīnandana. [break] He does some preaching. He goes to Bangladesh and does <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> on village to village sometimes. [break] ...if they give us the place or lease...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use of talking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> What is the use of talking with Lalitā Prasāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No. That was the.... Last talk was like that. I wanted that "You have to consider that whatever portion you can spare, give us on lease. We develop." That's all. Ninety-nine-year lease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I don't think he clearly understood. [break] Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In what way would we develop it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's birthplace? Make some nice building with some devotees, one to take care. That's all. Means making interested the local inhabitants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Start programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes. They should come and hear. The preachers, wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They showed me that one flat of five <span class="Italic">bighās</span> that.... They were considering giving this to us if we would develop one guesthouse and one institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they cannot make any condition. Whatever we shall like we shall do. There is no condition. If they give us on lease, they are concerned with the rent. That's all. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But they were willing to give outright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They were going to give outright one piece of land. They just requested that.... Their idea was that they hoped there would be a, some place for studying Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's books, one type of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura institute or library where people could.... All of his books would be collected, and his works...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is a good idea. That we can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And some place for studying also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Five <span class="Italic">bighās.</span> That we can do. If they agree, then let them give us. We shall do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Lalitā Prasāda Ṭhākura was saying that.... He was feeling that one more interview with you was necessary. However, I'm reluctant to say to go today because I haven't seen him for a month or two, and I don't want a two-three hour trip to just go. Maybe nothing may come of it. That's why I'm thinking on the way to Calcutta there would be more..., wouldn't be much expenditure of time, I mean, as far as traveling goes. And let's say, if something comes of it, then it's all right. If something doesn't come, it's not such a great loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, we can do that. Then we shall go by the nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh, yes. The nice. There's only one little bridge. Other than that, everything is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> There's one bridge like we went over yesterday. That's a little.... Otherwise, everywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, bridge, it is in good condition or not? Sometimes it is.... Last time we went, that injured.... It made some damage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> On what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The car was damaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh, it won't damage the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That is our concern. If the car is damaged, that is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The last journey there was some damage on the car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No damage on our car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Last time when I went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last time, when Prabhupāda went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh, no, since then they've improved the road. Oh, that road has been paved now. <span class="Italic">Pākā</span> road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> [break] ...there, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They've got a mango orchard also. What time will you be leaving here tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Early in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or when...? As you like. I have no.... [break] They.... How we see the sun is fixed up? The sun is moving, we see, so quickly. And the moon is moving, but it does not move. It is fixed up. Mean regarding the time, you can see practically, the sun is moving. And they say it is fixed up. The fixed-up article is moving quickly, and the moving article is fixed up. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> When a train is in the station, when the train pulls out of the station, when you're in the train, it looks like that the station is moving and you're standing still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Train has got different movement. But that means it has got different movement? Your analogy is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> No, but if we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot compare with train because train has got different movement. But they haven't got different movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> But if this was moving at the same speed as the earth, it would appear to be fixed up. If the moon and the earth were both moving at the same speed, it would appear to be fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We see practically. Now we are standing. We see the sun is moving. It comes. And the moon is moving, but it is fixed up. Why it is? The moving matter is stand still, and the fixed-up matter is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Actually, it's we who are moving. The sun is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But my speed is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My, this earthly moving, that speed is the same. Why you find different position? Just consider with brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If the moon is closer than the sun, according to the scientist's philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Philosophy.... But we see, I mean, a distant matter is moving. We can see. And nearer we cannot see. It is fixed up. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If you take a bicycle wheel, a spoke...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A bicycle you cannot concern. Bicycle or train, they have got different speed. You cannot compare. That analogy will not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Say you take one spoke, one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we, cannot.... You cannot bring bicycles in discussion first of all. You can talk all this to the fools. Analogy cannot be accepted unless they are similar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> The moon is locked up. The moon is in the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you are suggesting simply. You have no clear idea. Actually the sun is moving. That is my point. Such a huge, gigantic matter, and we see, so quickly.... From the sunrise, now, it is not even fifteen minutes. Just imagine how big speed is there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But it is not so fast at midday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It is not so fast at midday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Eh? No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> At midday, it is not so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faster, fast..., it is fast also. But because on the head. The speed is the same. You cannot say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One point is there, though, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If the moon is illuminating-it gives off its own light-then why can we only see half of the moon now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If the moon is illuminating, why can we only see half of the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say there is half of the illuminating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, because it's reflected from the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The shadow, then there is shadow. It is being shadowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If it's reflection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, reflection we do not accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's illuminating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Illuminating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Giving off light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then why is it that we can only see half of the moon, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Half moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About these movements, my position is different. My position is.... There is two movements, a sun movement and the whole planetary system movement. So according to the movement.... That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Why is it sometimes there's only quarter moon, no moon, half moon, full moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same explanation. On the whole, we have to accept that something wonderful is going on. And that is Kṛṣṇa's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot explain. You, you rascal scientists, from so much distant, you have calculated, "This is thi..." This is all wrong. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.</span> They are carrying order of Kṛṣṇa, not your order. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā.</span> "By the order of Govinda," not your order. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> [break] "There may be a God, but all these stories..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "There may be." That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> All these stories about Him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who says "maybe," he's not scientist. He's a rascal. Then why shall I hear him? Rascal. Why shall I waste my time? I am not going to waste my time to hear a rascal. How can I? I have got value of my time. As soon as he says "Maybe there is God," he's a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Then, if he says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, just like if somebody says, "Maybe there is a president," he's a rascal. He does not know what is the history, what is the constitution. He does not know. So why a gentleman should waste a time with such a rascal who says, "There may be a president"? Immediately he becomes a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Then he says, "There is a God, but all these stories about Him and His activities, they are just imaginations."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. You do not know what is God, after all. "There may be." Then who is going to hear you? You do not know. Your statement is also another story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> I am not a scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The scientists, if they say "There may be God," that means he's a rascal. Scientist means, whatever he will say, that is accurate. That is scientist. What is the difference between a layman and scientist? That is the difference. The scientist will say what is actual fact. That is scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> They only accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not scientist, that he..., "maybe, perhaps..." That is not scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Well, they only accept what they can confirm by experimentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means their experiment is not perfect. Their observation is not perfect-vague idea. So how he can become a scientist? That is no scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What is the position of one who accepts God, that there is.... [break] (end)</div>
