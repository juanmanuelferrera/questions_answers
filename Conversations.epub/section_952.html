<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their position, and they are proud of their knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not at all scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But they make up many very big words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That any rascal will do. <span class="Italic">Bambharambhe laghu kriya. Aparkulasvenavargolajagundakuligondoliojalīlāvale...</span> (gibberish) (laughter) You can talk like that-what is the meaning? That intelligence they have got, to manufacture... I know, I was in the medical business. So any petty medicine, and you inquire medical man, and he'll present it in such a scientific way that people will think that it is very important thing. I know it well. In Bose's laboratory we used to do that. <span class="Italic">Aparkulavenavargolajdgunda...</span> This is... (gibberish) Simply soda bicarb and little this and that. So the modern world means how to befool persons, that's all. Not to enlighten, but to keep them in ignorance and befool them more and more, and they like it. Under the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> they like to be cheated. (sounds of fire engines) Now just see the whole night there is blazing fire, and they are thinking they are happy. And if we sing <span class="Italic">saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka **,</span> "the material world is blazing fire," that is sentiment. And this is not practical. Whole day and night, simply fire, disturbing. Such a big important city, and they are disturbing always twenty four hours, <span class="Italic">gongongongongongongon.</span> They are so expert that this ordinary fire they can control. Another side is that nobody wants this fire, and why it is coming? <span class="Italic">Yathā duḥkha...</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja, long, long years ago: <span class="Italic">yathā duḥkham ayatnataḥ.</span> As this fire business is coming without my endeavor, similarly, the other part, distress, this is distress, other part, happiness, also will come. Why shall I endeavor for it? So my energies should be utilized only for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is civilization. And whole life, day and night, they are trying for material happiness, and that is not happening. The problems are increasing. No intelligence, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> They admit, the scientists, they admit that they are in ignorance. Simply bluff. Again one bluff, that Mars-going expedition. The business is going on in the Arizona, that's all. And after few years they will present some stone, "Now we went to Mars. There is no possibility of living there. Take this stone and sand and be satisfied for your millions of dollars that you have spent..." And they will say "Oh, we have made scientific progress. I have got this stone." <span class="Italic">Yo ko thako bhayargolihiya us ka tek lilaya</span>(?). There is a song in Bengal that formerly anything European, <span class="Italic">sāheb,</span> that is good. So one person is selling meat, flesh of dog. Flesh of dog nobody takes, at least in India. So he said that "This is not ordinary dog. This is the dog which was killed by Viceroy, that dog. And because Viceroy killed it, therefore it has become nice dog. You can eat it." So, anything these so-called scientists said, that is to be accepted. Without any common sense. This is your intelligence. But I am fool Indian, I don't believe it. (laughter) I immediately capture the point, why this rascal is talking of Arizona? That means the whole business is going on in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Deliberately cheating. You said that in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda's saying <span class="Italic">gāyatrī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brought newspaper, and as soon as they say... Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was in Washington. They showed a picture of Mars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop, don't read, it is now understood what is.... Mars, it is all in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were very perceptive to find it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No one is thinking like that. You are the only one who caught that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I am the only one at the present moment intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are still as dull (Prabhupāda laughs) as the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> We would never have thought like that, Prabhupāda, about Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They mentioned that the pictures of Mars appear just like some of the picture of national parks in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In other places they could not find, throughout the whole world, Arizona. That means the whole business is going on in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that if this terrain were on the earth, we would immediately make it a national park, it looks just like one of the national parks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In Arizona there is much government land. I passed through there recently. So there is good facility for them to make secretly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The moon business was done there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This means it's definitely a very calculated plot to cheat the public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the whole, all of the nations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to convince people that our, this rascal civilization is advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> International conspiracy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means all the nations are cooperating in this project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Russia and America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the so-called scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do they know that they are, are they talking with each other, or are they just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are knowing. They talk. <span class="Italic">Chauri chauri mātṛka-bhāi.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's a conspiracy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All thieves, they are cousin brothers, "Don't expose me and I'll not expose you. Let us keep peace." Two thieves, he knows he is a thief, but if he wants to reveal a thief, then his business will be suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are the greatest cheaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Chauri chauri mātṛka-bhāi.(?)</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Except for you, no one is blowing the whistle on these people. You are like a transcendental detective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (microphone rattling) That is the test. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ</span> [Bg. 7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> (microphone rattling more) It's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Los Angeles I asked you about this one verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> where it says that in a previous Kali-yuga the materialists were able to travel to other planets. And then it said Lord Buddha appeared to stop them, that they were creating havoc. But you said that was possible in this age also that they may be able to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (devotees offer obeisances) [break] (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...can't ever go to these other planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They will be able to land there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because their body is meant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even Arjuna even went higher planetary systems. But different way. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is <span class="Italic">yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25].</span> And formerly when big, big sacrifices were done, they used to come and attend sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The demigods. But in this earth body they can go to another planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But he must be competent. The yogis can go. Perpetually, they can go. Just like Durvāsā Muni did. He went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But they want to go and come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But they want to go and come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They are actually confounded by the element of time. They think that if they go in a spaceship they can then generate another human being by putting a man and a woman in the spaceship, and they can continue on for some time like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is theory. It is theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's their idea to reach very distant places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Today I was seeing in our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> hall that there must be now about a hundred and, at least a hundred and seventy devotees here, a hundred and seventy-five devotees. But still the <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> hall was not even half full, I think. It can hold at least four hundred people, that hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is big hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was a lot of empty space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> How many guests came yesterday? Did you tell Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, there were about five hundred, over five hundred guests. (loud short ambulance blast, laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Some ambulance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Some ambulance. Somebody is sick. Right now in New York City there is a big strike. The people who work in the hospitals, they refuse to work. They want more salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done? Price raising, they want all comforts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So if someone is sick they will not take him to the hospital because there is no one to take care of him there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This school is called Amsterdam School, Prabhupāda, because this is Amsterdam Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's very funny that Ninth Avenue turns into Amsterdam Avenue at this point. Ninth Avenue becomes Amsterdam Avenue on about Sixtieth Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yesterday there was a big parade in New York City, all people who are against abortion, they were marching. The U.S. is having a presidential election, so the Democratic party, they are having their convention in New York City to decide who will be their candidate for President. So all these people were marching to try to convince him to be against abortion. But he has already said he will not take any issue, he will not take a stand, because it is too controversial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Presidential candidate. He will not give his opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Who is that, Reagan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, Carter. They are unwilling to give their opinion because then someone may not vote for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, that's too controversial. Most people are for abortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they are for abortion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because it gives them unlimited room for sense gratification. The whole business is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They want to dance without paying the piper. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I tell them "Birth control by self control." That is our program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Besides that, why birth control?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say because the world is overpopulated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much vacant land in your country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, everywhere in the world. When we fly in the airplane, every country, mostly it's vacant land. It's only these big demoniac cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their philosophy is first we'll conquer nature, then we'll talk about self-control. That is one philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which is impossible. They'll never be able. You can control nature only by self-control. Otherwise, it is not possible. <span class="Italic">Ajitendriyāṇām. Ajitendriya</span> means those who cannot control the sense, sense organs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Famous address because you were there, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Hmm. Number one hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seventy-second Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One hundred, Seventy-second Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe we can go by it. On the way back if we go by, you could show us the building there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And we will be able to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that the flat that you were staying in that was broken into? Is that the place that was broken into?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not residential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I was residing there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That was where the typewriter was stolen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Tape recorder, typewriter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, from up here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was stolen by that caretaker, a black man. He expected some monthly remuneration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same thing happened at our temple here. They were employing one man for cleaning the floor. So after a while I told them "Now fire this man." So anyway, they fired him. As soon as they fired him he stole a big air conditioner, worth five hundred dollars. Anyway, he came back later and we got the air conditioner. I caught him and I said "Now bring it back," and I sent a devotee with him and he brought the air conditioner back. (pause) "Hall of Minerals and Gems."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are having a big exhibit of minerals and gems, Museum of Natural History. One thing about this museum, it can give Bhāradvāja many ideas for doll exhibits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, I'm going to go there with him when he comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This particular museum, we used to go when we were children, and fantastic exhibits, really realistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, dolls, dioramas...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, all dioramas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...of dinosaurs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, the whole thing is dioramas, the whole museum practically. I'll go with you also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are convinced that dinosaurs, these gigantic animals, were living on this planet millions of years ago. They found some bones, and they have created the form of the animal body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it true that there were big dinosaur bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they were, it is still now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, wow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't say it is extinct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you've explained that even if not here then it must be on another planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, another. This planet, what you have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's the point, what we have seen about this planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Could still be here. They found one in, where is that? In Ireland?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cannot be extinct, that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In that lake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But do you think they were on this planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, may be on this planet, but it doesn't matter that it is extinct. You have not seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their idea is that at that time man was living in the form of half monkey, half man in a cave, and gradually he evolved to become more civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is still there. <span class="Italic">Kinnaras. Kinnaras</span> means it is doubtful whether he is man or monkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a <span class="Italic">Kinnara-loka. Kimpuruṣa. Kinnara.</span> They are still existing. It is not that they are finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was reading a magazine when we were on the plane, and it was describing this type of monkey man, that they are being called, they existed in snow wastes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or what is called? The big...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Orangutan, gorilla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gorilla, they are like men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they are. Very much like men. We see them in the zoo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got their senses like men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's another species they call the Yeti. They say it exists in the Himalayan regions. But they've not been able to capture one because, uh... But there's been many citings and reportings of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These scientists, they find one little bone and they make a hundred-foot body out of their mind. They say, "Well if this bone was like this, then the whole thing must have looked like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the Museum of Natural History. They spend millions of dollars on these museums, making these displays. [break] (walking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...for dog, means she's going to become dog. She does not know how she is spoiling the life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Unless she gets one of our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is another plan. At least she does not know how things are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, unless someone gets one of your books, there's no way they can come out of the darkness of this material world. There's no other source of knowledge for the people nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-bhāgavate mahā-muni-kṛte kiṁ vā anyaḥ śāstraiḥ.</span> When there is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> composed, compiled by Vyāsadeva, where is the use of other literature? <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-bhāgavate mahā-muni-kṛte.</span> (pause) Dusty, eh? No one is taking care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They cannot afford to pay the garbage men to clean up the mess.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he's going there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's another lake over there. So we are checking for tomorrow's walk, if it is also a good path. That's a natural, not natural, a little more natural lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, this is good lake. People are becoming dishonest. They'll take money and do nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm seeing down at Dalhousie Square area that the government employees, they are constantly taking tea break. They come late to work...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen in New Delhi, I was going to sell my <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> so they were all sitting and gossiping, and files are piled up. If you want some file it will take six months. Doing nothing. Sixty percent of the employees are simply wasting time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> City workers are very famous for not doing anything, taking tea breaks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they will do? When they get money without doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we could just introduce to them the chanting, they could be great yogis, sitting chanting, and have so much free time. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, why this wood is dried up? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There is no spirit soul in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has been severed from the tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, from the, it is out of touch from the original bark. Similarly, any civilization which is out of touch of God consciousness, that will dry up in due course of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yesterday, Svarūpa Dāmodara-we were speaking about the scientists-he said that they don't accept our proof that God exists as being any more conclusive than their proof that He doesn't exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In other words, they don't accept that we have any proof that God exists. They say God doesn't exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God exists, we have given so many proofs. If the rascal cannot understand, what can be done? There is mother, there is children; where is the father? This is our argument. Mother, the earth is mother, and everything, these trees, we are all coming out of mother, mother nature. And who is the father? What is the answer? Now, what the atheist will say that there is no God? How they will say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say the earth is the mother and the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say the earth is the mother and the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is another nonsense. Because you cannot see, practically, the mother and father is the same person. That is not..., father is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why doesn't life come from the concrete then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from that, mother and father cannot be one, they must be two. Our practical experience. So how can I accept a rascal like you that father and mother the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we see that Lord Brahmā is born from the same father and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lord Brahmā, he has no mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he has a father, and the mother is that lotus flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Material energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> There's a classification of animals called autotroph(?). An autotroph is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you study your animal, whether your father and mother is the same. Then go to other animals. First of all your animal, you study first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can say though that the material nature is mother and father in this way, that both the mother and father are products of the material energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They want this impersonalism. They don't like the philosophy of personalism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole thing is personalism. You are talking because you are a person. You are talking all nonsense because you are person. Neither the air is talking, neither sky is talking. Because you are a person you are talking so many nonsense things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But then they'll say that after death that person doesn't exist any longer. That personality ceases to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Talk of the present, when you are existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. Their mentality forces them to believe only what they see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see there is father and mother. Why don't you believe that there must be a father and mother for the whole cosmic? You see everywhere there is father and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But they don't accept that as God's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means a crazy fellow. They manufacture their own idea. There is no reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say within the father and mother is the cosmic energy of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, we find the father and mother for begetting children. So as there are so many children... And that is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are all children, but their mother is the earth. There must be father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say father and mother is material. This is father and mother. They may agree, we have a human father, mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The principle. The principle. You have to see the principle. That is philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't agree that God is the seed-giving father, though. They will say "How can you jump to the conclusion that God is the seed-giving father of everything?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God says. Not only says, we don't see any production without seed-giving father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we don't see God. We see the tree is giving seeds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you don't see your father; does that mean there was no father? Suppose before your birth your father died, does it mean you have no father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> My mother has seen him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. You ask the mother, and she will inform you. The mother is Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we accept that everything has a father and mother, but the creation was always there. That has no father and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your nonsense, without father and mother, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> Before creation, the child was created, the father was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that matter can neither be destroyed nor created. It exists eternally. But there is no need for a creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why your body does not exist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It does exist, but in a different form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at least this body does not exist. This body was not in existence, it was created, and at the present you see, and in the past this body will not remain there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the energy will be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That energy is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And there's nothing else besides this energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but whose energy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why does it have to be any whose? It just is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just energy by itself needs direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't waste time. You stop this. If you imitate a madman, then you become mad. (laughter) Don't try to talk on behalf of these madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The principle is there, though, that there must be a father and a mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda, in New York City, many of these big buildings have courtyards, and in the courtyards they have purchased sculpture. So all the sculpture is abstract. They are against form; they are all impersonalists. And they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to have these gigantic structures. All over New York City you see them. They have no form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a form. The structure itself has a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But it's abstract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not ab..., it is form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not personal, that's what he means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is a form of their imagination, that's all. Not standard form, but it is a form. They want to make everything formless with form. That means they cannot avoid form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...political satires. Critic of the government put the criticism in the form of a children's story, but indirectly was criticizing the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...reason they cannot keep this park neat and clean? In other cities they keep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They cannot pay the workers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that? In America, city, New York, they cannot pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> New York almost went bankrupt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They have mismanaged the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They had big strikes last year or early this year. They wouldn't clear the garbage away, and the whole city was piled up with garbage everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> says in this Kali-yuga they are all lazy, misguided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much drinking, they must be lazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much drinking excessively. Drinking means laziness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Also the banks, they loan the city money, but at a very high interest rate. So then the city cannot afford it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> People nowadays are so filled with intoxications they are not fit to do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They loan the city money at a very high interest rate, so in order to pay it back they have to borrow more money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dried up on account of being detached from the original bark. Similarly, as soon as any civilization detached from God consciousness, they'll dry up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Simply buildings and cement, that is their culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Except for India, no civilization has lasted very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, cannot last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And as soon as they started to give up their culture in India, they're also dried up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll dry. That is the nature's way. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> Anyone detached from God consciousness, he has no qualification. <span class="Italic">Manorathena.</span> Their only qualification is mental concoction. That's all. Just see, how this... In America, such a wretched man. Willfully. Willfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They've become useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is due to excessive meat-eating, intoxication, sex. This is the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They've wasted their brains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Also these bums that hang around the cities, they're all alcoholics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> That's one reason crime is so high is because of intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Always increasing crime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America, millions of people have guns in their houses. Very common. They are all preparing for fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You said once in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that the one principle that gives the most trouble is the fearing in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] (in car) So whenever the Congress tries to pass a law to control the purchasing of guns, it is always defeated. They want the people to be able to have guns. They make a lot of money, also, selling guns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The best thing is they should be educated to become gentlemen. Keep guns, but they may not improperly use them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When New York City had to start borrowing money from the banks, the banks became very powerful. They were able to control the city government and get many favors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that favor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They get special contracts, concession rates, and they are able to get their men appointed to important government positions. Also, in the national government, the government of the United States has to always borrow money from banks. There is something called National Debt. Hundreds of billions of dollars they owe the banks, the United States government, to support all their different programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> National Debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> National Debt. So then the banks are able to use their power to get favors. "Oh, you want to borrow money? Then you must give me some favor." It's common knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everyone's trying to blackmail everyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Some people say that there is a worldwide conspiracy of bankers, that they can control any government. They can cause a depression. They say that the bankers caused the depression in the 1920s, 1930s, just to increase their power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As soon as you become dependent on me, I pay money, you can create some trouble for me. That is conspiracy(?). (pause) What is this, memory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Looks like World War I.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, World War I.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Veterans. What does it say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One hundred and seventh United States Infantry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...came here, Bhāradvāja and myself went to Salt Lake City to visit the church of the Mormons. The Mormon religion is a branch of Christianity, and they own the whole city of Salt Lake City. It's the capital of Utaḥ, one of the United States states. So they control the whole city, and it is planned with the temple in the center of the city. Like our Māyāpura plan. And all around the streets are named after the temple. It is well planned. And in the temple square they have a visitor center, and it costs hundreds of millions of dollars, with dioramas and movies. They even have a little planetarium. It's all for recruiting people to join their religion. So we went there to study how they did it. Actually, it's all based on a crazy philosophy. They say that after Jesus Christ was crucified in Israel, he rose, and then the next stop he came to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Next he came to America. Because Jesus, they say, is the savior of the whole world, so why just Israel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So when did he come to America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Immediately afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did he do here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He gave another Bible teaching. Again he converted people to follow, to accept him as God. So this whole religion is based on his teachings when he came to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Except for them, who accepts such a thing? No one accepts that except the Mormons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that God orders every man to get married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are very strong on the principle of family life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They also have a policy that anyone who is born in their family has to go on a missionary work for two years, then he's fulfilled his obligation. So the young men go overseas for two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like those two young men that you met in Melbourne? Those American boys? They were Mormons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are they vegetarian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, they abstain from... In Salt Lake City you are not allowed to smoke cigarettes. They have passed a law, "No cigarettes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the whole city?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the whole city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow, that's a big city. It's one of the capitals of the States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they have meat-eating. Originally they are not supposed to, but they are already deviating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Do they still have many wives?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, that's against the law. Originally they believed in polygamy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But now they are changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, now they are changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means no fixed-up idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No sound philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we also believe, but do we allow? We also believe in polygamy, but we don't allow it in our society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not for the time being, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't encourage sex life on the whole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that when you are married in their church, it means that when you then quit your body and you go to the spiritual world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we condone marriage. Marriage is Vedic principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is Seventy-second Street, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were going to show us that building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just on the corner of Amsterdam and Seventy-second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means next street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say when you go to the spiritual kingdom, you keep your same wife and your same children. That is their idea of marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Amsterdam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Columbus Avenue. Next is Amsterdam.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It says "Watergate." Watergate Hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which floor did you live on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I was trying to purchase one house here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which floor did you live on, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think third floor. And there was an electrician, he was my friend, one Jewish gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You would walk on this street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is one building with temperature, a gauge? Here it is. This is Broadway. I was taking bath here in a station. Sometimes I was taking the station(?)... I think this building is new. I was going to Dr. Mishra's apartment for cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What street did he live on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He... Seventy-eighth. The Riverside corner. Yes, I was purchasing my goods from this store.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Westend Superette.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were charging, a little chili powder, twenty-five cents. In India it may be one anna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were purchasing here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because I was going to cook my food there, so whatever I needed, I used to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How come you didn't cook your food where you were living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? There was no place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What was it like there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was an office room. That building is meant for office, not for residences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You rented a room there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I was paying seventy-two dollars a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And where did you sleep? Was there a bed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there was bed. There is toilet and water, but no bath and no cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Did you have to go there to bathe also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I was taking bathing there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where did you... Did you sleep on the floor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I had little platform. So on that platform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are the most bold person in the whole world, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We will never be able to do what you have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alone I was doing that. And then gradually one or two boys began to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did any of them come up here who are still with you now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only when you went downtown did the permanent men come. No one was visiting you up here? Hayagrīva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they came there, Second Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mukunda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That's amazing. How long were you there, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here? About six months. Then when my things were stolen, then one boy was coming, his name was Paul Murray, he invited me that "You come to my loft." He took me to Bowery Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I met that boy in Amherst. He has a boutique; he sells clothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You must have felt very bad when your things were stolen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I felt little disappointed. But some friends, they offered me, "Never mind, you take my typewriter," somebody, "You take my tape recorder."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Things were very easy here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Kṛṣṇa always provides facilities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there was no difficulty. I got from other friends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So when you moved down to the loft...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That boy, I gave him, Haridāsa, who was in San Francisco?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this Paul Murray... Haridāsa left New York, he went to San Francisco. His name was something else. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a steel factory. This is near the Ratha-yātrā carts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Steel factory, but very good house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Paul Murray, he was the boy that went crazy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was LSD man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> LSD man. He tried to attack you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not attack, but he showed some ferocious mood. I thought...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Very dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you thought to leave right away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You took all your things and went away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I kept with Mukunda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And that boy was keeping meat in his refrigerator?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is another boy, Yeargen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> John Yeargens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were staying with him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. Your Godbrothers could never believe this. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So at that time you did not think that anyone would accept your philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was certain. At the beginning I was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda was certain that they would accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think, Prabhupāda, that your exploits here are no less great than Lord Caitanya going into the Jhārikhaṇḍa forest and making the animals dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are the modern-day representative of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is building construction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Appears so. Telephone company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Bell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> New York Telephone Company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Pittsburgh... I was living in Butler, and a girl took me to Pittsburgh. So I saw at that time that she had to pay two dollars for parking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is why we get so much noise. Every time there's a call, when they come from here, and we're only just on the next block.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it's good for us also. If there's any trouble in the temple, they come right away, and they are friendly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Jayānanda brings them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> will conquer everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is how we get all our men to join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> By the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I joined because I had nowhere to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At first I had nowhere to eat, so the devotees in San Francisco, they gave me, then I heard you lecture and I became convinced. These banners are very common. You can see this one flying in the air. Most shops and things keep banners nowadays, but they aren't as nice as ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eighth Avenue. There's a restaurant called Asia Restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Asia? It's behind you. It's hard for you to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And there's another one, an Indian restaurant two blocks up, but they all serve meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And liquor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Meat <span class="Italic">samosās,</span> like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Like the Muslims. (end)</div>
