<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your mind, his business is to think something. But ordinarily the thinking is we accept something and reject something. Or accept the same thing and again reject the same thing. This business is going on. But if you think of question, there is no question of rejecting. Simply accepting. Then it is fixed up. Other things you accept and reject. Something we accept as "Oh, it is very good." Again, "No, no, it is not good." Accepting childish. Child is playing, one type of playing, "No, no, another one." That is material. And when you fix up, no rejection, simply accept it, that is Kṛṣṇa... So if you think of Kṛṣṇa... Just like here is temple. If you come and, as other devotees are doing, if you do, if you attend <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> if you attend <span class="Italic">bhoga-ārati,</span> always see, then offer obeisances, then naturally you will think of Kṛṣṇa. Then as you think of Kṛṣṇa, you become purified. Just like if you touch with fire you remain always warm. Similarly <span class="Italic">man-manā,</span> if you always think of Kṛṣṇa, you gradually become fully Kṛṣṇized, Kṛṣṇa's devotee, Kṛṣṇa's servant. That is perfection. There is no difficulty. People will not do that. That is the difficulty. "Why shall I think of Kṛṣṇa? I shall think of this, I shall think of that." This is difficulty. Otherwise not difficulty. You have to think something, think of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Finished. (Hindi with guest) <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">. Duṣkṛtinaḥ </span>(Hindi) <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) Beating with shoes by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that's all. (Hindi) "Come here, <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> kick on me."(?) (Hindi) (someone enters) Oh, when you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> This morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was thinking of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Oh, yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did you go to Bangkok?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> No, I'm going very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (converses in Hindi) Indian Māyāvādīs are more dangerous. (Hindi) Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said <span class="Italic">māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who is influenced by Māyāvādī, he's doomed. He's finished. No more spiritual knowledge. He's doomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> How far the study of the scriptures helps us in being Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is the essence of all scriptures. And follow it. It is, from the very beginning to the end, it is simply helping you. You haven't got to read many literatures. Just like those American, European boys, they are with me for the last, at most seven, eight years. Otherwise, three years, four years. So how are they becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious? It is not at all difficult. They are accepting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and becoming perfect. But in India: "Why shall I become Kṛṣṇa conscious? I have got this, I have got that." He'll bring thousands of Kṛṣṇa contributors, and he'll himself he has become Kṛṣṇa: "I am God." You see. He's so shameless that he says that "I am God." God is so cheap. Means shameless. He has no shame even, so how he says that he is God? <span class="Italic">Māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span> So-called <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> means <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyayā apahṛta-jñāna. Māyā</span> (Hindi) Who is very, very much under the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he is Māyāvādī<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless he is too much under the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> how he can say that "I'm God"? Which is impossible. (Hindi) So many things which makes one <span class="Italic">rāja,</span> and if you simply imagine, "I am <span class="Italic">rāja.</span> "So how much rascal he is. Just see. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one follow the Māyāvādīs and thinks that "I am God," then he is finished. His future is finished. (long conversation in Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> He can be fearless, free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. He's fearless. Natural. I have seen in my practical life. Long ago I was going in a tram car. So my son, he was two years old. The conductor: <span class="Italic">"Paisa, amsa." Bolte.</span>(?)(Hindi) <span class="Italic">"Ha! Mana pitājī he!"</span> (Hindi) He's confident, "My father is there. How he can get me down?" This is natural. <span class="Italic">Sanātha-jīvitam. Kadāham aikāntika-nitya-kiṅkaraḥ praharṣayiṣyāmi. T</span>hat is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> That "I have no fear. I have got my father here. I have got my protector." <span class="Italic">Sanātha-jīvitam.</span> That is... (Hindi) (end)</div>
