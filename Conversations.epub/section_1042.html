<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen, Gandhi wanted to organize a program, village [break] ...in the field, that this program for constructing toilet in the village, they have spent so much. You know that? The first business was toilet. To restrict them to pass stool here and there, they must have. Now in constructing that toilet paraphernalia, (indistinct), they... Therefore it failed, village organization. Not for that purpose. There were many purpose. Because they had no engagement, so why they should remain in the village? There are so many attraction in the city, and they get money. The factory-wallas, they're inviting, "Come here. You shall get twenty rupees per day." Why shall he remain in the village? So if you can organize in the villages, they are interested in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and getting nice <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then... One must have some attachment. In the city there are so many artificial attachments. So on what ground they'll remain in the village? Mind, always remember this. Unless you have got some attachment, there is no possibility. Gandhi's program was very nice, village organize so that they may not come to the city and help the capitalists. Remain satisfied in the village. But where is that satisfaction? That is the failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> If they add the holy name to their lives, they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If they could understand that. That will be helpful if you chant. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's statement will never be false. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> If they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> then gradually the dirty things accumulated within the heart will be cleansed. And if he comes to the understanding, clear idea, that "I want to eat something and my necessities... So if I get my necessities, primary necessities of life, and satisfaction of mind, then why shall I go to city?" That they can have very easily. If they follow the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that "Your first necessity is food." So produce food here. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> And you'll find here so much land is lying vacant. Because they have gone to the city for twenty rupees daily to manufacture Goodyear tire. And who will work here? Now I have seen in Delhi, the government is advertising, "Go back to the village." Rascal, you are manufacturing wine and keeping them engaged whole day in the work. So after being tired, he requires some wine. And why he'll go? And no spiritual education, no cleanliness. Simply inviting "Go to the village" they will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Just a propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they're thinking that so many people are coming to the cities, how we shall provide them? That's a problem. After all government has to supply them rations. Where is so much foodstuff? And if they are not supplied, then there will be resentment. That's a fact. What they are doing in the city, so many scooter (makes motor sound), going here and there. Actually no engagement. The girls are loitering in the street by dressing. It will become more and more problems, city life. So this is the solution, that they must go back to the village. But they are trained up to enjoy the facilities, so-called facilities, of the city. They are not going to village. But if we can introduce this <span class="Italic">hari-saṅkīrtana,</span> and if they have little taste, that is success. It's a great program. And that taste will come-<span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> If he simply becomes little sober that "I want to eat, I have to sleep, I want some sense enjoyment and defense. So if I can get easily in the village, why shall I go three hundred miles away? Just keep in mind the psychology. So that simple life will be possible if one is <span class="Italic">bhakta. Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> Only by devotion. Not by otherwise. Not by artificial means, by manufacturing toilet. Only <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> If they get little attachment for Kṛṣṇa the questions will be solved automatically. And they will be happy. Undoubtedly. That is the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's first instruction. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I come from village, and I'm happy now as I have taken to holy name and <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> So more, other villagers... Half of these boys are from villages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are villagers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They're chanting and they're so happy and they're going back to village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good life. Very good life. The village life. Provided he has got proper engagement. Otherwise his mind will be disturbed, and he'll seek after wine, after women, after this, after that. Devil's workshop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Because there's no sacrifice, because people aren't performing sacrifices now, is it more difficult to live off the land? It is more difficult to grow vegetables in Kali-yuga where there's no sacrifice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that sacrifice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Chanting. Chanting the holy name. Doesn't that make it more difficult to live? The weather's, everything's so disturbed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether you're not eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> He says there is no <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> sacrifice, people are not performing, that is why they are into the trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">. Su-medhasaḥ.</span> Those who have got brain substance, they perform this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña.</span> Those who have cow dung, they cannot. One who has got brain substance. <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ.</span> And <span class="Italic">alpa-medhasa.</span> The two words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Viśvambhara is having fever but he'll go to Koshi now. Viśvambhara is having fever but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Viśvambhara will go when he's better, maybe tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. There is another word. <span class="Italic">Tad bhavaty alpa-medhasaḥ. Tad bhavati... Alpa-medha</span> and <span class="Italic">su-medhasa.</span> These two words we get from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">alpa-medhasa,</span> they want to bring... Just like in name, <span class="Italic">Gītā-yajñas.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> They are manufacturing some ideas. Because other <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> are not possible in this age. First of all, there is no <span class="Italic">yajñika-brāhmaṇa,</span> there is no ingredients. So therefore this is the <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ.</span> This is quotation from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti he su-medhasaḥ. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni... [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> this <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Simply chant, and engage others in chanting. That is <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> First class <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> recommended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Prabhupāda? When we pass through the village how will we keep them engaged...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he'll guide you. You do not know. He is from village, he knows. Village or no village, wherever you chant, people will come. That is a fact. Either you chant in Calcutta Maidan or in the village they will be... India is still alive in that sense. We have seen it. We have experience. Wherever we have chanted, people have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> When you went to some place in Gujarat, Sanand? It was reported that thousands of people will come. It was a small village...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Village, if you go out they will come like anything. Even in the city we have got experience. In Calcutta we did Maidan. Thirty thousand they were coming. They could not understand English, still they are coming, simply by <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> This Haṁsadūta was performing <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> and all the Bengali ladies coming from outside Calcutta by train, and they're praying, "take this." (indistinct) Still India is alive. And I was speaking in English mostly. Also in Delhi. Still ladies are sitting. (laughs) What they'll understand English? But that <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> was so attractive, they sat down only for <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Nobody outside ISKCON does this <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they know? What they'll do? All rascals, fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Even some religious organizations are there but nobody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is religion. They do not know what is religion. They have no faith in God. This is their position. All bogus. I say it, challenging, do they know what is God? <span class="Italic">Ki bolo,</span> Mr. Gupta, do they know? People in general, do they know what is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> They don't know what is God. But they only respect God out of fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That is also good. <span class="Italic">Ārto arthārthī.</span> <span class="Italic">Ārtaḥ.</span> That is good. But still they do not know what is God. They have simply heard the name of God, there is God. That is good also. Than the rascals who deny the existence of God. So in comparison to them, they are very good. At least they accept there is something as God. God is good, God is kind, God is... But what is God they have no idea. That's a fact. That they do not know. Either the nonbelievers or believers. Both of them. They have no idea of God. This is the first time perhaps, in the world we are introducing, "Here is God, Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You have said many times you could give complete address of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes we give address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> And also we know the telephone number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the first time. Otherwise, they do not know what is God. Now you are coming from Christian community. Did you have any idea of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Just God is great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all... But what is that great? What is God you do not know. We know. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no more greater principle than Me. That is great. How you are great? <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am the origin of all the demigods." Next how you are great? <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is their ignorance. They have simply heard God is great, but how He is great, that they do not know. Here is the... God is personally speaking, "Yes, I am great in this way." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya.</span> Vedānta says <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> That is greatness. The original source of everything. So we are presenting God, "Here is God." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are other incarnations, but <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.</span> That's a fact. So try to present the real fact. It will be effective. If there is real reality, just like first class pure ghee... If one tastes, he'll hanker after. Without any advertisement, by the taste of the ghee, it will go on. Is it not? If you put little pure ghee on the rice, it will be so tasteful, that he'll want it again. But give the pure thing. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Try to give Him to the people. And how to take it? Hare Kṛṣṇa. He hasn't got to pay anything. God has given him the tongue. Induce him, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And that is the beginning. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau</span> [<span class="Italic">Brs</span>. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> It begins from the <span class="Italic">jihvā.</span> So people will be surprised, "How God consciousness begins with <span class="Italic">jihvā?"</span> That they do not know. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">sevonmukhe hi jihvādau. Jihvā,</span> the tongue is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. God consciousness. People are surprised, they think the mind, speculative mind is the beginning. No. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says tongue is the beginning. <span class="Italic">Muni, ṛṣi, muni. Muni</span> means speculator. So they think speculative mind is the beginning of God consciousness. But <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says no, not the mind. <span class="Italic">Manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one is speculator, he will be on the material field. <span class="Italic">Asata. Asato mā sad gamaya.</span> "Don't remain in the <span class="Italic">asat.</span> Come to the reality." That reality begins from the tongue. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.</span> <span class="Italic">Jihvā ādi, ādau.</span> So give them chance to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and give them chance to taste <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> They'll be... That's all. <span class="Italic">Jihvādau.</span> Utilize the tongue, primarily. And gradually everything will be...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> No what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ostādi, ostādi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Flowery language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) That is God is great. Nobody can defeat Him. Nobody can go beyond Him. <span class="Italic">Asama-ūrdhva.</span> Nobody is equal to Him. <span class="Italic">Asama, ūrdhva.</span> Nobody is greater than Him, nobody is equal to Him. That is God. And after there are so many Gods, everyone God. So what kind of God? If God has a competitor, then what is the God? God has no competitor. <span class="Italic">Asama-ūrdhva.</span> Everyone is down. <span class="Italic">Asama.</span> Not equal, not <span class="Italic">ūrdhva.</span> Then down. Two things, three things are there. Equal, level, upper and lower. So there is no upper and there is no equal. Then all lower. Then He's the supreme controller. <span class="Italic">Īśvara parama.</span> In the lower level there may be <span class="Italic">īśvara.</span> But they are not <span class="Italic">parama.</span> Subordinate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> <span class="Italic">Ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa āra saba bhṛtya</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 5.142]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āra saba bhṛtya.</span> God is one and all others, they are subjects. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānām.</span> Why these two words are used, <span class="Italic">nityānām.</span> Everyone is <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> but He's the supreme <span class="Italic">nitya.

No. <span class="Italic">Cetana.</span> Living. So how He can be imperson? Himalaya <span class="Italic">parvata</span> may be very big, the sky may be big, but it is not <span class="Italic">cetana.</span> Therefore this word is used. <span class="Italic">Cetana,</span> living. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> What is the difference? <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That one <span class="Italic">nitya</span> is providing, maintaining all other <span class="Italic">nityas.</span> That is God. God is great. That is the meaning. So anyway, make your effort sincerely. The basic principle is this. Induce them to chant and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> You'll be successful. Not very much <span class="Italic">ostādi.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So we'll write to you, (indistinct) books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Go to village to village. It is very noble attempt. And if you sincerely preach Kṛṣṇa will... <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti te.</span> There is no doubt.</div>
