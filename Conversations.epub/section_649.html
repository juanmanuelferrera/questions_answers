<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...hired these gangsters, professional gangsters to do this. So now one of these gangsters, he was to give testimony, and now he was killed. So they're thinking maybe the CIA also is doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is advising CIA?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The president. Nixon used to use the CIA to... If he had any enemy, he would have the CIA investigate that man. He was using it for his personal political purposes. [break] ...testing. In the early 1960's they were testing the effects of LSD, and so they gave LSD secretly into this one officer's coffee drink. And he drank it. He did not know it was LSD, and he went crazy and committed suicide. So now this investigation of CIA has uncovered this information. So now the family of this officer, they are suing the CIA for millions of dollars. [break] ... regular business of breaking into foreign embassies. In New York and Washington they did over 1500 break-ins, photographing documents, stealing coding machines. Sometimes when they would break in at night into one embassy, they would meet agents of another country who also were breaking into the same embassy, and they would salute one another. (laughter) It's a regular business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will not kill each other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, they respected one another because they were both after the same embassy. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...black government is going on all over the world. What they will think of people's welfare?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are all against us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply political gain. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...back to the temple we'll be performing <span class="Italic">āratik</span> to Your Divine Grace. And there was not very much time. I was wondering whether during the time we're performing <span class="Italic">āratik</span> to you, whether it's proper to be giving out cookies to the children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you make convenient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Is that proper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So we can go back now. Again program. [break] .now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> 6:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] I am not feeling very well. Last yesterday also. Heaviness. I am not clearing my bowels very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Is it due to the heat, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know why but I am not... Constipation? And now I'm feeling headache, some spasm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Should we cancel the trip this morning? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...very hot place. So every year I used to resolute, "Now I shall give up this place," every year. So I was going Kashmir, Darjeeling. Bhavani, that is near Nainital. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...just in the hot climate. In the hot climate it is more difficult to digest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Because here it is much hotter than it was in California.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The prasādam you're getting is all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very all right. Constantly change of hand is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Upendra can cook for you? Just like Śrutakīrti, he used to use the cooker. He would put up the vegetables and then give massage. And then after massage he would just chaunce the vegetables. He was able to do everything himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone was doing that. So we shall go or wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> After New Orleans, all your stops are in northern. Detroit and Canada. It won't be so hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now what is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Twenty to seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall wait or shall go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, I've sent the others on ahead to let them know that we'll be early. So it should be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the scheduled time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The Deities usually are opened at 7:10.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So we shall wait or go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Either way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> What about we go and have the <span class="Italic">āratik</span> first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And then after the <span class="Italic">āratik,</span> the curtains can be opened. Then Prabhupāda could speak. And after speaking, give out the beads. Because we have to... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Can we go now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car:) Why money? "No. Because I will be able to satisfy my senses more and more." This is the whole civilization. They have no other aim, no other ideas. "How to get money?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Another thing that is difficult for health is the constant flying in jet plane. (end)</div>
