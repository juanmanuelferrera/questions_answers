<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "...by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good, and God is all-merciful. <span class="Italic">Antaḥ praviṣṭaḥ śāstā janānām.</span> The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does the living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Kṛṣṇa gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because the living entity individually needs to understand Kṛṣṇa. Vedic literature confirms this. <span class="Italic">Yo 'sau sarvair vedair gīyate.</span> In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four <span class="Italic">Vedas, Vedānta-sūtra</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and <span class="Italic">Purāṇas,</span> the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to understand Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give us direction to understand Kṛṣṇa and the process of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> confirms this in the following words: <span class="Italic">tat tu samanvayāt.</span> One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can approach Him, and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the understanding of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and the goal of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are clearly defined."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God is acting within the heart of everyone. <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes. That's what I certainly believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> I certainly believe that. Oh, I think we're very close really, in our views of God, except that I'm concentrating on studying the working of God in the people of today. You are studying the message of God given by Kṛṣṇa in the... And I'm trying to show they are the same, the same view as that revealed by Jesus and by other great...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... When we speak of <span class="Italic">Veda, Veda</span> means knowledge. So knowledge means knowledge of God. Any scripture that gives knowledge of God, that is <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Don't think that <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> means that only the <span class="Italic">Sāma, Yajuḥ, Atharva.</span> Those who are following the principles to give knowledge about God, that is <span class="Italic">Veda. Veda</span> means knowledge. <span class="Italic">Vetti veda vido jñāne. Vid-dhātu</span> is called <span class="Italic">veda, vetti. Jñāne</span> when there is question of knowledge, these three forms are used: <span class="Italic">vetti, veda, vido, jñāne. Vinte vid vicaraṇe vidyate vid saptāyāṁ labhe vindati vindate.</span> (?) This is the <span class="Italic">vid-dhātu</span> description. So <span class="Italic">vid-dhātu</span> means to know. So ultimate knowledge is to know God. That is real knowledge. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvaiḥ. Sarvaiḥ,</span> all kinds of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> All kinds, <span class="Italic">sarvaiḥ.</span> So Bible can be taken as <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> because it is trying to give knowledge about God, maybe for a certain class of men. That is another thing. But the subject matter is how to know God. So that can be taken as also, as <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Because ultimate knowledge is how to know God. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we accept Bible also as <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but we simply say that they misinterpret the Biblical commandments. The Bible says, "Thou shalt not kill," and the Christian people are killing, maintaining slaughterhouse. What is this? This is my question. How they'll understand God if they are so much implicated in sinful activities? According to <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> there are four kinds of sinful activities: illicit sex, unnecessary killing of animals, intoxication and gambling. <span class="Italic">Yatra pāpaś catur-vidhaḥ.</span> So God is purest. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> How one can approach God if he leads a sinful life? That is our propagation. You give up this sinful life. Then you'll be able to understand God. You follow Christianity or Mohammedanism or Buddhism. It doesn't matter. You give up this sinful life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> In the Bible it says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's possible to see God, but only if there's purity of heart. And a sinful person has not got that purity of heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes, I... Some of the very simplest people have been years at home (?) and there's great intellectual standing. That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not simple. Sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not simple. We're saying "sinful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Oh, sinful! I... I thought... I thought you said... Sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, it's, it's, it's sin... I'm saying... Here in the Bible it says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And how can a, how will a sinful person have that purity of heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> No, well, a sinful person hasn't got purity of heart. No, quite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do you...? Don't you think that killing of animal is sinful activity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Well, it's a very difficult problem because surely the whole of creation has been part of God's work, and the whole of evolution, building up to man, has consisted in the killing of animals, one species killing another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why a human being should be like one species of animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Well, er, man should gradually grow out of that. I agree. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he's in lowest stage, animal stage. Who is killing, that means he's in animal stage. So how he can see God? Can animal, cats and dogs, can see God? That's not possible. How the animals can see God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Well, we don't know at all what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> We can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your Bible is meant for not the cats and dogs. It is meant for the human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are not meant for the cats and dogs. All <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> and scriptures and <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they are meant for human being. So if human being remains on cats and dogs, how he can understand? If he voluntarily remains like the cats and dogs, then how he can understand the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> or <span class="Italic">Bible</span> or <span class="Italic">Koran?</span> He cannot. <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to become pure before understanding what is God. Therefore every civilized society has got a type of religion to become purified so that he can understand God. Without being purified, how it is possible? That is not possible. So at least these things should be accepted as they are in the Bible, "Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not covet." Illicit sex life, intoxication, and killing of animals. These are in the Bible. Why they are not accepted? This is not our impositions. This is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And in every scripture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...for purification there are so many processes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how they can be God conscious without being purified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Well, I think you're probably getting tired, and I think I probably...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can give some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Take some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> You don't know what the time is? Good gracious, quarter to six. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are very glad to meet together, and we are ready to help you in your research work, provided you take our help. That will be very nice for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I'll say one thing. If you want to see where in the world people are experiencing God, experiencing their relationship with God, you should examine this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes, well I've, I've...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You'll see people who are living in every minute of every day in relation with God, and their experience is joyful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...and full of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Actually, it's not that we're studying the past, but we study a principle called <span class="Italic">dharma</span> which means that principle of life which never changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> That's our main concern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Well, I'd very much like to have records of experience, accounts of present-day experience. Although as I say, at the moment I'm rather tending to concentrate on the western. I'm hoping to get scholars who are really Sanskrit scholars and those people who can really understand the language of oriental affairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first thing is: this, this is a different science. Science of God is not material science. Simply material, academic career will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> No, no. I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "Eastern-Western" will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> No, I get example (?) to both, both from the East and the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply by becoming Sanskrit scholar or Latin scholar, it is not sufficient. He must be God-realized, purified. Then it is possible. <span class="Italic">Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234] "By your these blunt senses it is not possible to understand what is God, what is His form, what is His name, what is His quality, what is His kingdom, what is His paraphernalia." These things are to be understood. God means... Just like when we speak of "king." King does not mean alone. King means he has got his queen, he has got his kingdom, he has got his secretary, he has got his minister, he has got his palace, he has... so many things, king, royal. When we speak of Queen, we immediately remember the Buckingham Palace, his (her) bodyguards and so many, so many other things. Similarly, God means He has got His entourage also, everything. He's not alone. To understand God means to understand everything of God-His name, His fame, His līlā, His pastimes. So <span class="Italic">nāmādi.</span> With all these blunt senses, how can we... We cannot understand even the Personality of Godhead, what to speak of other things? "God is a person:"-it is a very difficult subject matter for ordinary man to take it, very difficult subject. That is stated in the... Even the demigods they cannot understand. That is... Because he's thinking materially that "This cosmic manifestation, then creation, is so big, and it is created by a person. How it is possible?" But... Because they do not know what is that person. Simply by the word "person," he is afraid: "Oh, oh, oh, oh."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "He's like me. I can't do it. Therefore not a person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "No person except He's like me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore the Vedic scripture says, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> His person is different. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda.</span> That is not exactly with our personality. This is material. This is temporary personality. Now I am man. Next time I may become dog, Next time become demigod. It is changing. It is not eternal, <span class="Italic">sat.</span> So God is not like that. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā [Bg. 4.6].</span> He does not come here being forced by the material energy. He comes by His spiritual energy. <span class="Italic">Sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā.</span> Find out this. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore, as soon as He's accepted as ordinary man, <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam, paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not know what is the power behind that. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Ajo 'pi sann avyayātmā bhūtānām īśvaro 'pi san, prakṛtiṁ svām adhiṣṭhāya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prakṛtiṁ svām adhiṣṭhāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā [Bg. 4.6].</span> "Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original, transcendental form."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth. Although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past births, whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kṛṣṇa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> or His form. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti</span> means nature, as well as <span class="Italic">svarūpa,</span> or one's own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but yet a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body, but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body by His internal potency. In other words, Kṛṣṇa appears in this material world in his original eternal form with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is the Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough, He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He had many grandchildren at home, or in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still, He looked just like a young man, twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">. Purāṇa-puruṣa,</span> the oldest man, oldest living entity, but <span class="Italic">nava-yauvana,</span> just like young man. <span class="Italic">Nava-yauvanaṁ ca. Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">. Purāṇa</span> means oldest, because He's the origin of all living entities. But <span class="Italic">nava-yauvanaṁ ca,</span> just a fresh, young man. Hm. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "And, although He is the oldest person..." (continues reading to the end of the purport)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes. So you have got this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> now. Kindly take it. That will help you in your research work. And whenever you kindly ask us in some question, we are prepared to help you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> One thing I noticed, at one point you mentioned that you only have a few years to go and you're working on this particular subject of how religion is experienced today. Do you really think you only have a few years to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Well, I don't know, but I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is material calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> I'm getting on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> I'm seventy-seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, are you really seventy-seven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> I'm seventy-seven, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But are you really seventy-seven? You see what I mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> When does the work begin of actually knowing God, to actually know God? When does that business begin? Actually, we think that when this body is finished, we are now finished. But if we're not working toward God, we'll come back here and work again because we're working in some other direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So to be working in the vicinity of God, as you are, that's good, but to try to know God, that's the ultimate destination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes, well, that's... Yes. Well, I agree. But I must think of getting back to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They're bringing some fruit for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> In a few minutes they're bringing some refreshments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> I can take you straight to the station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> And I must catch at least the 7:15 train.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Oh, yes, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> 7:15</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> 7:15 there'll be plenty of time. If we leave twenty minutes from now, by that time you will have had a little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They're bringing something right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to go to Oxford?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Yes, yes, I must. I've been to the great temple of Rāmeśvaram in southern India, south of Madras. It was a very fine experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the temples you have seen? South India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> A temple in southern India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Rāmeśvaram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Rāmeśvaram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmeśvaram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Rāmeś... I'm sorry. I pronounced it wrong. Rāmeśvaram. There pilgrims bring water from the Ganges. They have a pool in which they keep it. I think. I'm not quite sure if I understood, but I think that over the period, all pilgrims bring water from the Ganges. And I think this water in this pool is Ganges water, which is continually added to by pilgrims coming. I'm not sure about that. That's what I understood, but I don't know. I'd a rather amusing experience, there. I was doing a drawing... I was very fascinated. Its very beautiful pagoda-like entrances, north, east, south...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Temple gates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Temple gates. Yes. And I was making a drawing of this. So I had a very big crowd around me. And my Indian friends... I'd been staying at Mandapam (?) which is the... It was a naval settlement. Well, it was really a settlement of the Indian fisheries. My biological interest had always been in the sea. And these friends came over, and they left this case while they went to take photographs. And they came back. And so the crowd were very excited. "Would you like to know what they're saying?" And so I said, "Yes." So he said, "What they're saying is, 'Isn't he wonderful! Isn't he wonderful! He's taking photographs with his fingers.' " They were more used to photographs, I think. They'd never seen anyone doing an actual... They'd seen symbolic drawings, but... I was reproducing the temple gates, and they said I was taking photographs with my fingers. I thought that was a wonderful expression really, "taking photographs with my fingers." (Someone brings in <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>) Oh, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can keep it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Perhaps if you keep your case there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Oh. My case, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You can use it like a little table.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Thank you. Such a huge... Oh, now can I have... I'd like some of this. Put that down. Put that down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> You know the Indian style of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> I must follow you, how you eat this. I don't know how you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything you can eat, as you like. There is no restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That's called <span class="Italic">purī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> <span class="Italic">Purīs,</span> yes, that's lovely. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> You probably had those in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> [break] ...through India, going out to the Far East. I've been out advising on the setting up of a fishery, biological research, at Hong Kong. But I never believe in going straight out and I've always stopped in India, various places, very little, short time. (eating) I had a great friend, Professor Bower, who was professor of zoology at Lucknow. He then became the vice-chancellor of Patna. But he overworked very badly, and he had a breakdown, and then... But he was an awfully nice man. I stayed with him in Lucknow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This zoology is another subject matter, whether life began from matter or matter began from life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> That's a great problem in biology, how did life arise from the inorganic matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Quite a problem. We don't agree. We think that it didn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> No? I say, that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Life came from life; matter also came from matter, er, life. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, janmādyasya yataḥ.</span> And it is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there is no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> But life may have arisen from the inorganic by the breathing in of the Divine into it. And there's no doubt that our bodies are material, but within our bodies is this divine, what I call the "divine flame" in one of my (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not the "divine person?" Wherefrom flame comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He says, now how to find out the Divine Person from whom the flame comes? Just like you were talking about how God is a manifestation of power, in your statement. But the manifestation of power we always find in relation with a source of power. Just like the sunlight is a manifestation of the power, and this great power of the sunlight, they're tapping it for electricity and so many things now, but that sunlight is not an independent entity. It's dependent on the source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">Veda</span> also, points out, <span class="Italic">yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.</span> So your New York going is suspended now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> No, I'm still going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> As soon as possible. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then talk of all this moral instruction. If you are killing yourself, then why do you object? Why? [break] <span class="Italic">...ācari prabhu jīve śikhāilā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I recognize the Bengali. What's the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should teach philosophy by behaving yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Very nice. So simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...talked with many gentleman, lawyer. That Goldsmith, he was against war, but when I asked him, "Whether you are meat-eaters, killing animals?", "Yes, that is our food." So if the poor animals can become your food, the big nation can say, "The small nation is my food. I can kill them. We can kill them." Everyone can say. And that is happening like, "Might is right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Goldsmith? He's a lawyer or something in Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, hm, hm. (Yes) No, not Los Angeles. New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh, this Gold, Martin... Some, his name was, in Los Angeles, Gold, Martin Gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> [Break] ...Tagore thought of in India today. I've always admired Rabindranath Tagore's very much, his poetic writings. Do people in India think much of him today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Rabindranath Tagore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta :</span> If his writings are highly considered by people in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Not at all. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is his writings? So many speculation. That's all. But it has got little similarity to Vaiṣṇavism. His Gītāñjali...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> He had a great reputation in the western world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But his literatures are not read by our... A section.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Mostly in Bengal. And because he was accepted in the West, therefore they are very proud of it. But otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Russians read. I have heard that in your Oxford University there is study of Rabindranath's books? They study?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> They study which books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rabindranath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sir Alistair Hardy:</span> Oh, I think they produce some of them, yes. He gave a course of lectures in Oxford about 1923, or, '22 or '23, which were very well attended. I wasn't there, unfortunately, but I read them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 1953?</div>
