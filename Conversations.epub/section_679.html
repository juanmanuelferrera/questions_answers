<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...position is if you can get a bungalow like this, and two cars, good wife, then life is successful. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Never mind I am going to be a dog next life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> They are not knowing anything today. They continue to live as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śreyaḥ, preyaḥ,</span> immediate. This is Western civilization. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-praptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> (Hindi) In the material world, even in the position of Indra, king of heaven, he has got also so many problems. Is there any temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes. Śiva temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Newly constructed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, it is quite old, but they go on adding small buildings for the public hall and all those. Suppose you have to have some program. They can give us a hall for marriage and for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is where we had the <span class="Italic">paṇḍāl</span> in 1972?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, it was a little bit on the other side. It was very near to this place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Stayed in Nasi? (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Ah, you stayed here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> You can go in the garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] He is going out of station? [break] ...such parks as in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No. They are going out</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...erly kept. [break] This is the condition of every city. In America also this. This is artificial living. It cannot go on very nicely. [break] ...description of nice city in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> but we don't get any information of municipality. And big, big lakes in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Nice parks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Park and lake. [break] ...if Upendra comes, he will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I was just thinking that he might only change his visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He could get an extension. For every American, for three-month visa, then you apply for an extension. You can stay for maximum of six months. But then we can replace as more devotees come. Rūpānuga wrote that ten devotees are on the way from America. As more devotees come, then we can replace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Upendra has come to India only for a few months, so it might take a little while to get used to situation here. And some boys are here who are already two, three years in India. They know how to do it. And again, if he has to go in a few months...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's very difficult at the moment, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If we have that choice, then I humbly say we not open the Ahmedabad temple now because... At other temples, like Calcutta, which have (unclear) and which are in a very critical situation because I haven't given them any men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] You require one man to your selection. So nobody will stay. Everyone has to go. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... [break] The Ahmedabad people cannot maintain this park. How they will maintain their center? And you are not making good life members? Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> These are only few days that they have started making... Last time we came they made eight members in five weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Members are made after the festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> My point is this, that people are very attracted to foreigners. If there is one good foreigner, then they will be attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you discriminate, this foreigner to that foreigner?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I don't mind anybody. Whatever you say is all right. But I was just thinking like this because if somebody's going to come for a month, two months, then go, he might not put his heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the position of everyone. When they will go away, there is no certainty. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma... Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) You are student? You are student? Somebody suggested some meeting here? Yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, that gentleman was there at seven o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That man passed us and just kept on walking with his friends. Just when we were coming here, the same man just kept on walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Gerau? Gerau? What is that Gerau? Gerau? You know Gerau? Naxalite?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> These are all important things. It is not in our concept. Even a small man, from the starvation, can stay in a hut, inside a bungalow. There the people are making delicious food. They'll starve and die. How? Because they won't give (unclear). It is not because they are taught by some gurus or... Not like that. They are themselves (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Good and bad go together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> These are other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> It is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But I am talking of good only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Satya...</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...is not God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa is not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> According to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa was the greatest man ever born. He was not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> You see, he has got the principles of <span class="Italic">Ārya-samāj.</span> Because he is... "Everybody is God." That is his... They are brainwashed. Brainwash is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is God? Let us have, understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> God has no form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Why? Because that is a principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That's the principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> He has given all the principles and these principles they taught us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. You say God has no form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your principle, not others'. You cannot say that is the principle. That is <span class="Italic">your</span> principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But, sir, there are certain principles laid down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> And He Himself also cannot break those principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this principle? You have got form, and God has no form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What God has done, fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> If He will take form, then He is just a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That is what we are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is your word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> According to philosophy. It is not my philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is your philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> It is not my philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because just like you say, "God has no form," we say, "God has form." That is your philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Then we have to find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then we have to discuss whether God has form or no form. That will be philosophy. That will be philosophy. If you say, "God has no form," if I say, "God has form," then I don't fol...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> God is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> He cannot be <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka</span> if He takes form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is your thinking. You do not know what is meant by <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-vyāpaka</span> means everywhere</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you do not know how... Just like the sun is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun, the sunshine, yes, it is... We call now it is day. Just hear. This is day because the sunlight is there. At night we don't say it is day. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> "We" means actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any of... Every one of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> When we don't see, then we say that it is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Sun is not... Sun, of course, is there, but light is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hear. The light... As soon as the light is there, you understand the sun is there. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, sun is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom the light is coming? From the sun. But you see the sun has form. So from the form the light is coming. So the light is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> If it is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let me finish. Light is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But if there is some obstruction, then it cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no question of obstruction. Even there is obstruction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Obstruction will be by you only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Not by me only. (laughter) No, not by me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> What is the independence mean? You can go up to Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Light is there. If you close your eyes there is no light. That is another thing. But light is there. Everyone understand now it is day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That light is from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Sun has no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Let him finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let me finish. Your "God has no form"-I am trying to explain to that. Now, you say, your reason, the <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka. Sarva-vyāpaka,</span> I am giving this example. The sunlight is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka,</span> but wherefrom the sunlight is coming, it has got a form. So the <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka,</span> that energy is there. That is called Brahman. That is coming from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But what is that sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, it is example. It is example that this <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka-prakāśa</span> is coming from the sun globe. So sun globe is localized. Everyone can see. And this <span class="Italic">prakāśa</span> is coming from Him. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka</span> energy is extended everywhere, but it is coming from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Coming, right. But that has no form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why no form? You can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But you see the mat..., a material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a matter... You have no idea without matter. How you can say of spirit? You have no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> God is not matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> This is not a direct...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are accepting God is impersonal because He is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> Why? <span class="Italic">Sarva-vyāpaka...</span> He can be... You are thinking in your own way, that you are sitting here; you are not <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> You are <span class="Italic">vyāpaka</span> here only, so you are thinking God is like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, I am not thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is your defect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> On the contrary, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiye aiye.</span> That is your defect. You are comparing God with your existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I am not comparing with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... I am giving you example that instead of sun having form, he is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> That is my point. The sun and the sunlight is nondifferent. The sunlight is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka,</span> but the sun is localized. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Sun is localized, but what is sun, first of all? Sun is a creation of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He's giving an example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. If creation of God can act like this, that it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Creation of God means some matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Now, God has no matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You see, God... If creation of God can act like this, that he is localized, at the same time he is <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka</span> and God cannot be localized and <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> How can God be localized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then God is under your rule?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, sir. Not under my rule. It is His rule that He...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We can see the creation of God. It is localized, at the same time <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> And God, according to him, cannot be localized. He is simply <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> Why? Why? The creator can create something that he is localized, at the same time <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka,</span> and the creator cannot be localized and at the same time <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Sir, if there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all let us settle this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> First of all let us settle this one thing</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Settle this. I create something which has got so power that it is localized, at the same time <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> And I myself, I cannot be <span class="Italic">sarva-vyāpaka.</span> What is this logic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> The sun rays are not actually... When there is hindrance, it cannot be on the other side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, hin... There is question of hindrance. I am seeing as it is. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Hindrance is already there, as I described before. (laughter) Swamijī, my request is that the world is divided into two main things. One, some people believe, a group, believe that world is formless. Some say world has got a form. So instead of entering to this controversy, why we should not agree that whatever you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is not controversy. This is fact, that God is... That is... We learn from <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br class="calibre2"/>tattva yaj jñānam advayam<br class="calibre2"/>brahmeti paramātmeti<br class="calibre2"/>bhagavān iti śabdyate<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.11]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The Absolute Truth is manifested in three ways: impersonal Brahman, and all-pervading <span class="Italic">Paramātmā,</span> and Personality of Godhead-<span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate</span>-but they are one and the same. This is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> So we can understand from this example that the sun is localized. Everyone can see. At the same time, sunshine is all-pervading, and within the sun globe there is a predominating deity. He is a person. Similarly, originally God is person, and then, when He expands, all-pervasive, that is <span class="Italic">Paramātmā.</span> And when He expands by His energy, that is Brahman. This is understanding. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti.</span> Now somebody, they finish their business by realizing the impersonal Brahman, and somebody finishes his business by realizing the localized <span class="Italic">Paramātmā,</span> yogis. <span class="Italic">Jñānīs,</span> yogis. And the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> they come to the real, original source of everything, Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Swamiji, I want to question whether the Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the same type of consciousness which is experienced by the devotees as that divine type of consciousness. Is it a divine consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa consciousness means divine. Kṛṣṇa means divine. Kṛṣṇa means divine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> So that is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But foolish people think Kṛṣṇa as ordinary man. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> Only <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> take Kṛṣṇa as ordinary man. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa is always His complete spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> We like His smiling face too much, Lord Kṛṣṇa's smiling face, always smiling. All forms of God we have seen, but His...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is always smiling because Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">ānandamayo abhyāsāt.</span> That is the feature of God. He is <span class="Italic">ānandamaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But (unclear) even in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> at the time of chariot, while sitting on the chariot of Arjuna, He was always smiling. There was a lot of battle going on, but He never lost His...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Temper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> Yes. How do you think about somebody in last few days defeated the existence of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> itself? They say it is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> They may, they may.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has defeated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> No, if they say that "There was nothing like <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span>" you tell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> They may say, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The foolish man can say anything. (Hindi) How he becomes more than all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> this rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> My question is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your question is that he has proved. What he has proved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> No, no. His point of saying is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever he says, he is saying nonsense. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> No, no, the point is that it is a story to teach people the rules and regulations of war. He wrote... It is a hypothesis during which the people are taught the morals of the life. No such war actually existed. There is already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his foolishness. He's a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But we have seen a person rejecting his own father: "My father was also (unclear)."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore a rascal can say like that. A rascal can say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Somebody said that "No, my mother's name should come after my name, or father's name."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Therefore they have been called <span class="Italic">mūḍhas. Na mā duṣkṛtino mūḍhā prapadyante narādhamāḥ.</span> They have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ.</span> First of all they are very, very sinful. They have got merit, but sinful merit, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ. Kṛti</span> means meritorious, but <span class="Italic">duḥ, duṣkṛtina.</span> So on account of their [being] <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ</span> they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> They cannot understand what is scripture, what is God, what is Kṛṣṇa. They cannot understand. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, I at least understand what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You want to save yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> His definition is different, absolutely. According to his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God cannot be defined differently. God is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But can God be defined? We haven't got a definition of God. I challenge you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> You cannot. Intellectually, you cannot analyse things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, intellectual level you can. That is definition of God. <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa. Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya...</span> Parāśara Muni has given. That is God just like you try to understand one thing. We have got some experience that there is a rich man, but that rich man cannot say that "I am the richest man in the world." That he cannot say. So this richness is one opulence, but you cannot find anyone who can say that "I am the richest man." That is not possible. But if you find somebody who can say like that, and if he proves, then he is God. <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya.</span> That Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram: [Bg. </span>5.29] "I am the proprietor of everything," that Kṛṣṇa says. And He proved when He was present. He proved it. So therefore He is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> I say, in foreign countries, Swamijī, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you cannot see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, we want to know from Your Holiness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot see? Who are they if they are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, yes, yes. We are very much... We take a pride. Actually we take a pride that Your Holiness like you had gone for America and the world and spread our message of our Indian philosophy. We are very much proud about it. Though we do not give much response to your mission here or in India because it's our home. Home is for the neighbor only(?). That is the difficulty. Tulsi das has written (Hindi). Swami Vivekananda went there, and he was honored there, and thereafter our people honored him because other people honored him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Let us go. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just... (Hindi) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [Break] (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> We have not seen father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> The body is not father, and what is father, what is in the father, we have never seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have not seen. You have no eyes to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> I have not seen my father. Even I have not seen myself. I see my hand. When you say "I see my hand," I see my body, but have I seen my self?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> He is my friend. He is my friend Mr. Urbana, and he is an architect, prominent architect in Gujarat, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> He's a first-class..., but he is, his brain is influenced by <span class="Italic">Ārya-samāj, Ārya-samāj.</span> (laughter) So I say <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājīs</span> are muscular body. Bodies are muscular, so their brain is also muscular. They are not going to accept any idea except that thing which they have already there in the brain. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, no, no. It is not that way. We want to accept everything that... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Praṇām, praṇām,</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">praṇām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Do you believe in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> Yes, we believe in <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Who gave <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Īśvara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> God. God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, without a personality nobody can write. You cannot write your signature without a body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> How did you get your actually words? From where? From where did you get your words?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Well, I have got my body, so I can speak with my body. I cannot speak without my body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> At that time He acted like a magician, that God. How can He reduce it into writing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhagavān, original Absolute Truth... (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> "The Absolute Truth is that from whom or from which everything emanates." (Hindi) Everything is manufactured, everything. Now, that original source...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> There are three things: <span class="Italic">jīvātmā, Paramātmā</span> or <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> (Hindi) Who is not connected with anything, He is, simply is a guide. He guides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So formless guidance... (Hindi)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Formless guidance, <span class="Italic">Īśvara...</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> If you want a guidance, then you have to become formless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. You are talking. You are not formless. You are giving us guidance, you are talking, but you are not formless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Guidance I am not giving. It is guidance of God. It is given by God. It is given by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. How? No, no. If guidance cannot be given by a formless...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I am a medium simply. The guidance is given by God. That is through <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are contradictory. You are talking something, you are form, and you say the original talker is formless. How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Sir, you are building building. There is no architect? How in the building there are no architects? Anything that is made must have got an architect or... Whole universe is there</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But none of us... I believe that there is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> No, no, but why don't you give a body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But why do you give Him a form, actually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Because we have got forms. He has got form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Just because you have got form, He must also have a form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes, because we are His reflection; we are His particles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, no, no. We are not His particles. I say it is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, where you get this idea that formless can give guidance? Where do you get this idea? Where is your experience? Your experience is as soon as there is guidance, there is a form. So how do you get this expe... Why do you talk something which is not within your experience, nobody's experience? As soon as you talk of guidance, there is form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But what is air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, first of all answer this. Why do you get this idea that a guidance comes from formless? Just like this government. We do not see that the guidance coming from the sky. There is Indira Gandhi; there is minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But these are all in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how do you say that guidance is coming from formless? Because you have no such experience, why do you say something which is not within your experience?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> So whatever we experience should be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Otherwise you cannot talk. If you cannot say anything which is not within your experience, then what is the meaning of that talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Even if there is no form, we have to create a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Just to have our faith in that form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Now, actually, when you pray God actually, do you open your eyes or do you close your eyes? What do you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> We close our eyes. We also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Why do you close the eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't close. We are going to see God in the temple, so we don't close. You close, and therefore you cannot understand. We see in eye to eye. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> So He is only in that particular place. He cannot be everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, He is everywhere. But you say, "He is everywhere, but He is not there." That is your idea. You say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, no, no, sir. No, sir. He is everywhere. He is throughout.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why not in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> He is everywhere, I say. He is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are in the... He's in temple. Then why do you say He is not in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But who says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I don't say that. Not that only. Not that only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If He is everywhere, why He is not in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But not in that form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your version. (laughter) That is your version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then there is somewhere where He is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, no. I say... No, no, no. Somewhere... He is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He is a <span class="Italic">mūrti</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Everywhere. But He is not that <span class="Italic">mūrti.</span> He is not that <span class="Italic">mūrti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your version. But we are not so fool that we are going to see something which is not God. We are not so fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Well, then, your opinion may be different. My opinion is quite different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is another thing. But when we go to see God in the temple, we see God, nothing else. That experience you haven't got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Mūrti,</span> simply that <span class="Italic">mūrti</span>? Nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The confirmation you haven't got at the present moment. Thereafter you will get a realization, afterwards. (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> And about forty people are here all over, coming since about fifteen years, or twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He entered Jagannātha temple, He immediately fainted: "Oh, here is my Lord." So it is the question of seeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (6):</span> But what is our inner things? How we know it? In our classical music, actually Lord Kṛṣṇa is the main figure in all... In even Muslim classical music, they also pray Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to create our eyes to see. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (loud car noise)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> And I think that it is badly needed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (8):</span> [break] That gentleman whispered in my ear, that "I am <span class="Italic">mūḍha"</span> he said. And I said, "Yes, you are a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He confirmed it. That he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (8):</span> But he said that "I am a <span class="Italic">rākṣasa,</span> maybe. Of course, you are like that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then anyone. Why he is alone? Anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (8):</span> No, he claims that "I am a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>" "Yes," I said, "you are." When he questioned, I have to reply.</div>
