<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you'll find everywhere. There is no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Americans are more sophisticated. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The court's ruling like that, then it will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got our own fight. The thought-checking. "I am thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Why you are checking me?" This will be our defense. Do you think Kṛṣṇa-thinking is illegal and madness? Then you have to condemn the whole Hindu religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Every religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Kṛṣṇa is taken as Hindu God. So I'm thinking of Hindu God. Why you are checking? [break] We are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and killing Kṛṣṇa. This... Our national father is supposed to be a great devotee of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but Kṛṣṇa is killed. Why the government does not take it seriously? Gandhi wanted <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> as guide. Why they are not taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the Vaiṣṇava (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all bogus. Bogus. Simply bogus. Politics. In Gandhi's <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> I saw not a single Vaiṣṇava or Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Photographs, you mean to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "He's Vaiṣṇava." Bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He never visited any temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bogus! Simply politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He wanted to kill(?) other Muslims and all other... Especially untouchable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people approached him that "Mahatmaji, you have got influence over the Muslims, why not stop cow-killing?" "I cannot touch on their religious principles." Just see. Cow-killing is religious? Their religious principle. If I say my father-killing, mother-killing is my religion, so Gandhi will say, "Yes, you can do that. Nonviolent." Kill nonviolent. This nonsense contradiction can be tolerated by the fools and rascals. That's all. That is... Nonviolence, at the same time cow-killing. This rascal, another rascal... You are observing <span class="Italic">Buddha-jayantī</span> and daily cow-killing. As if Buddha, Lord Buddha, recommended cow-killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Buddhists all eat, are meat-eaters the world over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not a question of Buddhist. That is Christian, Hindus, everyone. Rascals. Lord Buddha, he was nonviolent, and this Jawaharlal Nehru was observing <span class="Italic">Buddha-jayantī</span> and at the same time sanctioning cow-killing. What is that? Cow-killing. "What is wrong in eating meat?" He has said that. [break] ...advertising our movement. Everyone's asking, "What is this Hare Kṛṣṇa?" That is the whole American people. Even if one did not know, he is "What is Hare Kṛṣṇa?" And our books are selling, "What is this Kṛṣṇa book?" So indirectly they're advertising. [break] Their greatest shock that "Our people being taught 'No illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication.' Then where is our civilization?" This is their greatest shock. Any sane man can understand that this Hindu culture is being forcibly introduced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Must be. That is also the same person, meat-eating, how you can separate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) Free. Freedom. We have cherished that type of freedom in our country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are thinking I am checking on their freedom. They eat meat. I say, "No, don't eat meat." So I am checking on their freedom. They'll take it in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It's called a fool's paradise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These people must have sort of a false sense of superiority also because of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is another point. India is becoming superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) I think that is more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And her controlling this younger generation. That is another point of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They're putting black man without any penny in his pocket, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In 1971 many papers astonished how one Indian is controlling so many white men. There, our paper became surprised. They cannot control even one white man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This type of mental, sort of makeup, has been created after the industrial revolution, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These German people have accused that "The old man is sitting in Los Angeles and he has engaged all these young boys and getting money from them." The German propaganda. They're thinking that way, that I have some mind control power, I engaged these young men and they're getting money and I am enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Everyone judges others from their own standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're surprised, the neighboring people around our temple, "How do you live so comfortably? You have got so many cars and so nice house." But they are working hard like hogs and dogs and we are getting money without doing anything. They are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> We invite them to come and join us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they will not. Why there? Here also. They are envious for this Hare Kṛṣṇa, but when you call, "You come and live here," that they will avoid. They're envious of my opulence, and when I say, invite, "You come also and join," "No. I'll rot as hog. That's all. I prefer this hoggish life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And the she-hog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This will create a sort of a turmoil...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has already created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...America at this particular judgment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It will create much more turmoil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The more they create turmoil, the more we become famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They say mind control and brainwashing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, but actually that is what you are doing. You are cleaning our brain and teaching us how to control our minds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our method is <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Yes, actually it is washing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Brainwashing is very bad in India, not only in America but the whole world over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I condemn everyone, that "You are all dogs and hogs." And United Nations a pack of dogs barking. That's a fact. And in Chicago I said, all women, "You cannot have freedom. You have got only thirty-four-ounce brain, and man has got sixty-four-ounce." I told them. So I became a subject of very great criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Women's liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I denied, "No, you cannot have." I told them. One girl in the airship, she was seeing like (makes some gesture-laughter). I asked her, "Give me 7-Up." "It is locked now." So I frankly said that "No, no. You cannot have equal rights because your brain is thirty-four ounce." Actually that's a fact. Where is woman philosopher, mathematician, scientist? Not a single.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Apart from that, I mean, they are made for a particular mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can have equal rights? Up to date in the history there is not a single woman who is a great scientist or great philosopher or great...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Madame Curie was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All bogus. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are getting too harsh on them because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. How can I give you equal rights, because your brain is less substance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We cannot degrade our mothers that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not degrading. It is accepting the actual fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These girls are misled, these American girls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no history. There is no history. Just like Kunti's mother. She produced so many heroes, but she was not hero. She could produce heroes like Arjuna, like Bhima. But not that she becomes hero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mother can produce heroes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Still, nobody will say that Kuntī is as good as Arjuna or Bhima.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can anybody say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... How you'll get the equal rights?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No woman smaller than Kuntī could have produced an Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can produce. That is another thing. A cook can produce foodstuff suitable for rich man, but that does not mean he is rich man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You argue. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda, you told one story about the animals having a meeting and trying to become free from the control of (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> say (Sanskrit).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Sanskrit) Everyone is (Sanskrit). That is according to his position. That does not mean equal. Kṛṣṇa Himself worshiped Sudāmā Vipra. That does not mean Sudāmā Vipra is as good as the Personality of Godhead. When Nārada was coming in Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa immediately got down and... Nārada was smiling, "Just see the fun." But etiquette. Nārada never said that "I am better than Kṛṣṇa or equal to Kṛṣṇa." Never said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone. Everyone knew their position. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is addressed by Arjuna, "Acyuta, You promised to drive my chariot, therefore I'm asking You. Don't forget. You never deviate from Your promise." Acyuta. <span class="Italic">Senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta [Bg. 1.21].</span> "Don't forget that You are Acyuta. Don't think that I am Your servant, I am ordering." He knows that "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa. I am ordering Him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You were explaining to that reporter in Pennsylvania, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that actually this women's liberation is just a trick by the men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes! It is trick by the men, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How... Could you explain that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because if they remain free, they get young women free. That's rascal's man brain. That "You take freedom."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is a third-class argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is argument! This is argument. This is fact. These rascals keep these women unmarried to enjoy daily new, new young women, these <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> these rascals. There is club. There is club. These young women are paid for that topless, bottomless. You do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. I have never seen a girl naked. I refuse to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have... I know everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda, you gave the example that what is the use of keeping a cow if you can get milk in the marketplace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Cow-keeping is expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Why keep a cow when milk is available. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> It's a fact. The young men think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They make pregnant and they go away. And this poor girl, either she has to kill the child or beg from the government, "Give me welfare; otherwise..." Is that freedom? These rascal woman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is freedom. Actually the government recognized...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government means a set of rascals. But practical point of view the woman wants equal right. Equal rights they enjoy, and the woman becomes pregnant, and he goes away, the boy. And she has to kill the child or beg from the government. This is her freedom. And still, equal rights. Where equal right? The boy has gone away. You also go away? No. You'll have to carry the child. To get freedom you have to kill or you have to beg. And still she thinks, "I am free."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Such experience (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rather we are giving freedom, that "Never mind you have got illegitimate son. Come here. Live with us. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And by teaching them to be chaste...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And teaching "Don't do it again." That's all. We are giving. And they are happy. My Godbrothers criticize that "You keep women in the temple." I tell them, "I cannot reject."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was also thinking like that, today, I mean, presence I said, that Vaiṣṇavas keep woman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is different situation. I cannot reject anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, that's right. You are right. But this is a great affecting the boys down here. After all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are taught, "Don't be misled." But if they cannot, that (indistinct). I cannot deny. I cannot deny. I cannot say that "You are woman. You are condemned." I cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to keep women away from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is personally as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> not that... He never said that women should be refused Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. Nobody has said so. But they should not mix.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here in the Western country it is their custom to mix, intermingle freely. How can I stop it? I may stop in my temple, but they will do it outside. So it is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Nowadays even in the universities, they allow the free mixing of boys and girls in the same dormitories. In the same dormitories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the same dormitories they live together you mean. Girls have no separate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, yes. Free mixing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Same showers even. Bathroom the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa gives freedom. <span class="Italic">Striyo śūdras tathā vaiśyās te 'pi yānti parām.</span> "Never mind. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Come on." <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Anyone. Come on. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>" This is my propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> My mind is haunted by those (indistinct). There will be somebody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that I sincere to Kṛṣṇa, He'll do the rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is right. You have extreme faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith means extreme faith. Not reserved. Faith does not mean any reservation. What is that? <span class="Italic">Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span> This is... <span class="Italic">Ananya-bhāk.</span> No reservation. That is... <span class="Italic">Sādhur eva.</span> He is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> Whatever he does, it doesn't matter. <span class="Italic">Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk. Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> He <span class="Italic">sādhu. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ, bhajanty ananya-manaso [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the words. Require staunch faithful devotion. Then you are perfect. Then doesn't matter what you are, what you are doing. Whether the real point is fixed up. <span class="Italic">Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span> Fifty percent, ten percent devotion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not even .001 percent reservation. I mean so far the <span class="Italic">bhakti's</span> concerned. <span class="Italic">Bhaktya avyabhicareṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhuyaya [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even in the Brahman platform. Not in the material platform. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītya. Sama-prakarena utītya(?)</span>. Cent percent <span class="Italic">utītya(?).</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is credit, and this is also, I mean, that this should happen also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here is the right movement. This is the test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If all that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who cares for this Transcendental Meditation? They are not hogging any propaganda. It is coming this ear and going this ear. They don't care for it. So many others have gone. Who cares for them? They are not serious for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because they know it is changing the whole civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There's that one verse you were saying, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that so many Brahmās may come and go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless there is opposition, it is not genuine. It is not genuine or it is not serious. Opposition must be there. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead-there is opposition always, from the very beginning of His birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa had all the opposition throughout His life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Throughout His life. That means genuine Supreme Lord. Before His birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Before, yes. And after, He was cursed (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śiśupāla was His cousin-brother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Cousin-brother. (Sanskrit) If you consider that, He rose against all odds. Greater the opposition, better you become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu [Bg. 9</span>.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> God must be equal to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are right. With that extreme faith, Jesus took to the cross. Huh? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the greatness of the movement. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We will be meeting with all people in the whole world. And you will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am the oldest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) Keep in my hand and walk. And I would say, sir, that you also should not take bath in cold water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't take. I... Since 1970, 1966, '67, I am not taking cold bath. Before that, even in America I was taking twice cold water bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have never taken cold water in my life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shower I was taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All these boys take cold water, required from them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I never used hot water. In India the Delhi is the coldest part. In my business life, in the hotel I was taking cold water. Everyone was surprised. "How you can?" In Saharanpur, in bitter cold, I was taking cold water early in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This will be extreme cold in river. I have taken bath in the confluence four or five years back. It was not winter, but then it was... It is cold throughout the year because snow melt and keep water very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...gentleman will have a flag in the home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> During the times of Moguls you have seen all the pictures with the flag.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was the system. Our Pandit Jawaharlal was keeping one flag also, always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But what prosperity India must have. Those people from Europe tried to find out India and went down there and found America. What prosperity they must have... What prosperity India must have then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India can have prosperity even now if they take their own culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, even material prosperity I mean to say, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material. Mind is also material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Europeans came here for material prosperity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want satisfaction of the mind, that is material. That is not spiritual. <span class="Italic">Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) [break] <span class="Italic">Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni.</span> Mind and the senses, they're <span class="Italic">prakṛti-sthāni.</span> They're not spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but, sir, if that is material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mind is subtle matter. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir.... Bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are separated five material energies. <span class="Italic">Apareyam.</span> They are inferior. Those who are in the mental platform, they are also inferior. The so-called philosopher, scientist and others, they are on the mental platform. Therefore they're inferior. <span class="Italic">Apareyam.</span> These eight elements, those who are dealing with these eight elements, <span class="Italic">apara,</span> inferior. And they are advertising that "We are superior." "The spiritual consciousness is brainwashed. We are superior." This is the fault. Of the inferior position, they are claiming superior position. <span class="Italic">Apareyam itas tu...</span> And Kṛṣṇa is giving practical example: "<span class="Italic">Apareyam:</span> this is inferior. Beyond this there is a superior nature. What is that? <span class="Italic">Jīva bhūta.</span>" Immediately. And still the rascal cannot understand what is superior, inferior. (Indian lady converses in Hindi with Prabhupāda) Chase after them, "Get out! Get out! Your visa is finished." (Hindi) Hundred cases. Hundred times hundred. (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is our argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It would be the brainwash. To have washed it against...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am thinking of Kṛṣṇa, and if you stop me to think of Kṛṣṇa, is it not going against my thought? <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is recommended, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto.</span> So this is a standard thing. So I thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Why you should stop me? Is it not infringement my freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They argue that they are not stopping you from thinking about Kṛṣṇa. They want to stop you from being a member of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If I have to think of Kṛṣṇa, I must be member of the society. Otherwise how can I think of? Suppose if I have to do business, share business, I have to become a member of the share market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that the way the society is managed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can say. But this is the system. If you have got some thought, you must mix with such similar thoughtful men. That is everywhere. The scholars, they associate; the medical men, they associate. How can you stop it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They don't think it's healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may think anything nonsense, but this is practically going on. The medical men, they make their association. Especially in your country, unless one is member of the medical association he cannot practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But the medical association does not take up twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Not only twenty-four hours, twenty-six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is their charge, that it is too extreme. They say we isolate the devotees from the real world. We don't let them read newspapers, we don't let them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your real world, but you do not know what is reality. Your real world is this body. But this body is not real. That, you rascal, you cannot understand. Your reality is this body, but body not real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Even if this world is not real, temporarily it's real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temporary, yes. So I am eternal. I must associate with eternity. Why shall I..., temporary. Suppose if somebody comes in India, American, that is his temporary residence. Why shall I accept India as everything? Similarly this body is another India or for Indian, American. It is temporary, <span class="Italic">asann, asat. Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> This body is temporary. That you have no knowledge. Why shall I be attached to the temporary things? I am the owner of the body, I am reality, so I must realize myself. Self-realization. This is self-realization, that "I am not this body, I am pure soul, Brahman." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even Jesus said so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christ said that if getting everything one loses his own soul... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> "What is the value?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "What is the value?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They would say that we are ignoring this world and retreating from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must! We must! You rascal! You do not know the science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They have their retreats and monasteries, Christians also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must. That is the science. That is... You do not know, because your tail is cut you want others also to cut his tail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their main charge is that we are deceptive. In other words, we tell people that we are like this, but actually we are different. They say we tell people we will make them more intelligent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are different, how the professors and scholars, they are accepting our (indistinct), they're taking our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that's all right, but you practice differently than your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our book says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto.</span> We always think of Kṛṣṇa. We act according, strictly according to our books. That is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The book says that this is the highest consciousness. They say it is not complete, because it doesn't have anything to do with the real world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we say that you are rascals. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If they say we have nothing to do with real world, where does the real world go when they are sleeping? (indistinct) I think that you must go for that. No? We must find out the full according to their own folly, not according to our reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just... The example of their charge of deception is that we are the Hare Kṛṣṇas, but when we go to sell our books we are in disguise. Therefore people do not know that they are giving money to the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. So they say our whole movement is like that in many different ways; we are tricking people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> No, but the priests nowadays, they don't always wear the collar, because they want to feel comfortable with the people. They dress...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say "If people knew you were the Hare Kṛṣṇa, they would not give you so much money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Even the police, in order to catch a criminal, they sometimes go in disguise. They act as criminals, in order to catch a criminal. So we also have to do that. We have to act like demons sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (laughing) To catch a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These boys are very clever. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Vāmanadeva also went in disguise. And Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma, and Arjuna went in disguise. They killed Jarāsandha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> you wrote about Prahlāda Mahārāja, they tried to find out "Where are these Vaiṣṇavas? They must be coming in disguise to teach the boys Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) American gangsters. You can't be gangsters. They will be gangsters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> For Kṛṣṇa we can be anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You can't be gangsters. There is some difference between them and you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This scholar from Harvard University, he's explained it very nicely. He says that today Christianity and Judaism are materialistic, and the people who follow those religions have misunderstood their own faith, and the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is reminding them. And it is the work of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How nice he has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His name is Dr. Harvey Cox. He is widely known all over the world as a leading Christian theologian. He has written many books. And he said that Christianity today is synonymous with profit, material gain, accumulation, performance, material success. So it has lost or it has forgotten its original message. And it takes something as exotic as the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement from India to remind a Christian that there's another way of life, based on simplicity and truth and spirituality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's right. And he's a very important man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He has joined this society to defend us. He's now traveling different places in the United States to speak on our behalf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's serious gentleman. That is wanted. Kṛṣṇa will help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Aldous Huxley is another, he's also very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> He's dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is dead. No? He is dead? How long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Since 1962.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I had no idea of it. I am reading his books thinking he is still alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> He's a Māyāvādī, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Aldous Huxley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aldous Huxley. He is useless. Anyone connected with the Ramakrishna Mission is a useless. Immediately take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was connected with Ramakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On one radio show they quoted from this Dr. Radhakrishnan that when you read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you should not think that Kṛṣṇa is God. So then they say, "So even in India they reject this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement." They say "Look, this is the president of India. He is saying do not take Kṛṣṇa as God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So even in your own country, the priest talks crazily. We should reply that. Why do you go to India? In your country, your countrymen take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Jesus was crucified in his own country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> By his own men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a Bengali proverb (Bengali). In a village, if a saintly person comes from outside, he is invited. And if a saintly person there is in the village, nobody cares for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes. The Bible says the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs, repeats saying)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This will create some difficulty for your movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't care for it. We will go on. Caravan will pass. Let the dogs bark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The dogs may bite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Barking dog never bites. (laughter) They simply make their show. Neither they can bite. We shall go now? (end)</div>
