<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>December 27, 1976, Bombay</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Jagadīśa? [break] ...on the real goal of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because they do not know that the goal of human life is to become freed from the repetition of birth and death, therefore there is no, as explained in the First Chapter of the First Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya<br class="calibre2"/>kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mandāḥ sumanda-matayo<br class="calibre2"/>manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.1.10]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The people in the age of Kali, the age of quarrel, have a short duration of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you are tiger? How are you, Mr. Tiger?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> This is Mr. Ganesh's elder son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, a Tiger? Your grandson?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Tiger. (Gujarati)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is... He is tiger? <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Thank you. Hm. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> People are lazy and unfortunate. They have no knowledge. And besides that, they are misled by foolish leaders. The leaders are intent only on deriving sense gratification from their so-called high position. In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> also it is explained that men who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who do not glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a civilization of fools, a fool's paradise where the common people are allowed to elect from amongst them one so-called leader who is the biggest rascal because he doesn't know anything, and none of the others, the common, people know anything about the purpose of life, and yet this so-called leader becomes elected on the basis that he can do something to help suffering humanity. The material existence is nothing but a struggle against material nature which ultimately has no value. But it's an illusory struggle because of the spirit soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it has no value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll not say that is has no value. You must give the reason why it has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It has no value because there is no permanent connection between the spirit soul and the material energy. There are two kinds of energy: material energy and spiritual energy. We have experience of both. The material energy is described in the Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can describe like this. Just like if a man is diseased, so the physician imposes upon him some restriction, do and do not. So if by mistake we give up the do not's, then it is useless. He should observe the do not's. Then he'll be cured. And if he does not observe the do not's-whatever he likes, he does-that means his disease is increasing. Therefore it is useless. The real aim of life is how to get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> which is forcing me to accept the cycle of birth and death. That is my disease. Therefore <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> means restricted life, not unrestricted life. So if we do not follow the restricted life, that means I shall continue my disease or increase my disease. The modern civilization, we are teaching how to enjoy this material world to the fullest extent, <span class="Italic">bhogaiśvarya,</span> sense gratification and for sense gratification, material opulence. But he does not know that he is killing himself. He is aggravating the disease. He has to accept another body. But that he does not know, that he'll have to take birth and die, again the same business. That he does not know. Therefore this civilization is misguided. Yesterday we were reading, <span class="Italic">tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyet sattvam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to purify our existence. So this aim is missing-how to purify it. <span class="Italic">Sattva,</span> I am eternal. Now I am existing in a condition, birth and death. That they do not know. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not know his interest. He's thinking, "This is life. Let me enjoy and there is no life after death, and even there is, who cares for it?" This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (Indian man):</span> That <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> means restricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Protect your mind... Wed it to the soul and taken away from all extraneous things which are made up of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> is that not the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> means to rescue the soul from this material condition, <span class="Italic">yena sattvaṁ śuddhyet,</span> to purify your existence. What is the impurification? Impurification is that the soul is subjected to repetition of birth and... That is impurification. That he does not know. So he is missing the goal of life, and he's thinking this temporary so-called happiness for twenty years, forty years, fifty years, or, utmost, hundred years, that is his ultimate. That is a misleading. He does not know the aim of life. He thinks this material enjoyment to make this body stout and strong and enjoy senses like the hogs. Therefore it has been (called) <span class="Italic">na arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye.</span> The sewer hog, he is thinking, "I am eating stool. I am getting fatty. That is my life. And I am enjoying sex without any discrimination." No discrimination of sex, either mother or sister and daughter-it doesn't matter. This is hog's life. He does not know. As soon as he becomes fatty he'll be captured, and the <span class="Italic">bhangis</span> will, what is called? Toast, make him a toast. In our country they do. In outside of the village they hang the pig and with fire, roast it. And he, it cries, "Kyaa, kyaa, kyaa." And it is roasted, and they enjoy. But that he does not know. He is getting very strong but he does not know that he's going to be roasted. Therefore he is misguided. He does not know nature's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, isn't the real <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> (indistinct), <span class="Italic">dvijātmānaṁ brahma-rūpaṁ deha-tyāgi vibhayaḥ tena kartavyam...(?)</span> (indistinct) That type of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is a <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who is going to take the <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span> He was going to take sense enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is a <span class="Italic">tapa</span> itself. That <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is amongst the <span class="Italic">tapas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Just like they are in the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> line. They are doing <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> They are rising early in the morning, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, observing <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, so many things. It is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Whole thing is <span class="Italic">tapasya, tapaḥ,</span> because by this <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> the contamination of the soul will be cured. Then, if he understands Kṛṣṇa, then he is transferred to the spiritual world. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not come again to accept the material body, and he permanently lives in the spiritual world. That is perfection. The modern civilization, they do not know all these things. They are misguiding that "You earn to your best extent. Work very hard like hogs." And there is advertisement "Work hard. The next (?)." They are pulling one trailer, rickshaw, still, their leaders are advising, "Work hard. Work still more hard." A human being is pulling on trailer and rickshaw, and still hard work. And that rascal does not know that this hard work like hogs and dogs will not make the solution. But they are enthusing, "Yes, work hard. Be stout and strong, as if becoming stout and strong will save him. That's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Modern civilization is a civilization of class, and Vedic civilization was a civilization of soul. We can say that is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the real civilization. Soul is enwrapped with this material body and it has to be stopped. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is civilization. And he has no knowledge, <span class="Italic">na te viduḥ,</span> what is the civilization. Then <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> The rascal leader is also blind and the followers are blind, so both of them are doomed. Therefore the conclusion is, the modern civilization is misguided. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.</span> Big, big leaders, they promises big, big ideal that "I shall give you this facility. Just elect me." What facility he will give? No facility. He gives some false promise and gets his election and claps. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not know what is the aim of life. <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.</span> He is animal also. And the other animals clapping, "Oh, we have got such a big leader." Big elephant, yes. (laughter) And elephant he may be, but he is, after all, a animal. What he'll do? Misguided. Oh, Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> You don't require any covering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, I do, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi) My daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have not seen him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He used to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyone's question about this, this misdirected civilization? In India there was no such misguided civilization. Now they have learned how to misguide people, and they have taken this ideal, that "Unless we become like the Europeans and Americans our progress is checked." This is going on. Actually there is no progress. We are condemned. Why they should waste so much energy not for progress. Before British period, India, there were cities, but not like this because their energy was utilized. Cities were constructed especially in pilgrimages, like Mathurā. Mathurā is very old city, but that is a pilgrimage. Dvārakā, that is also very old city. First of all there was no need of big, big cities because there was no industry. They did not know what is industry. And there were ample food-food grains, milk, vegetables. Those who were eating meat, they were eating small, nonimportant animals like goats, hogs, and they never touched cows. Cows are very important animals. Even the stool, urine, is important. In the agricultural field the cows, passing stool, they will also benefit. Natural fertilizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And From cows' dung we have produced penicillin in Calcutta (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be, but why penicillin is required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but that means it had some value right from beginning. Our forefathers must have known it. Why they did not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we are speaking... We are speaking... Because it is important, therefore Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya.</span> Why <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya</span> required, you do not require any explanation. Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya,</span> "You must protect." That's all. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Because we have no brain why Kṛṣṇa-giving up all other animals-He is giving stress on <span class="Italic">go.</span> And that is meaning. He never said, animal-<span class="Italic">rakṣya, paśu-rakṣya,</span> no. Those who want to eat <span class="Italic">paśu,</span> let them eat nonimportant like hogs and dogs. There are class of men who eat dogs also, hogs also. Or, utmost, goats. But don't touch cow. This is instruction. And modern civilization first of all killed all the cows. And when they are no more available then can you eat other animals. I do not know why our government is now restricting cow slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have banned the cow slaughter all over India now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. Eh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> This is only in Maharastra, on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are restricting in Maharastra also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the reason all of a sudden they have good sense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vinode Bhave wanted it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vinode Bhave is not so important. There is government policy, something. Otherwise they could not care what Vinode Bhave said. It is... Don't think it is due to Vinode Bhave's request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but that is what apparently...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Vinode Bhave. There were so many agitation for stopping cow slaughter, big, big, Karpatraji and others, others...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> One Śaṅkarācārya fasted seventy days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so they didn't care. Now, all of a sudden, why this good sense? Vinode Bhave is not very important. There is some policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that Sanjay Gandhi who is very influential is a staunch supporter of Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that may be cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I read in the papers the other day. He addressed the youth of the Arya Samaj.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I understand from our propaganda that one... What is the Swami?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Chandra Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chandra Swami. He is the president?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, of Bharat (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has recommended our case, that "This is the only institution who is making the Christian Hindu. Before this movement the Christian converted Hindus. Nobody could convert the Christian to become Hindu. And this is the only movement that is converting Christian to Hindu." So he is very much in favor of this movement, and it is understood that he talked with Indira Gandhi in telephone. So maybe that if that Hindu movement is increasing and in India the cow slaughter is going on, and it is against Hindu, (they) might have considered like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Pakistan has banned cow slaughter. Because they had done away by vengeance, all the cows. They wanted to spite the Hindus, kill the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't think they kill cows in China either because its economic value is too great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are coming to the sense how cow is important. (pause) It is said that he wants to see me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, at <span class="Italic">Kumbha-mela.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. Before me, for the last two hundred years, so many swamis and yogis went to the Western countries. Nobody could convert a single person to Hinduism. That is a fact in the history. These foreigners-giving up meat-eating, illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling-it is a horrible thing for them. Lord Zetland said, "This is impossible for us." Factually it is impossible, because American government spent millions of dollars to stop this LSD intoxication but it was not successful. But they have seen that as soon as the same boy comes to our camp, he immediately gives up, immediately, without any protest, that "Why shall I give up?" No. I ask, "You have to give up." "Yes, we do." That's a fact. Therefore this Swami Chit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Chandra Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Chandra Swami, has strongly recommended that "This is the only movement which is converting Christian into Hindu." He is pleased on this account. He is not interested our Hare... He has said that "I am not very much interested in Hare Kṛṣṇa, but I am interested in this point." That is natural, that nobody could convert the Christian to Hindu, but this movement is doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is indirectly accepting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact. We do not make any compromise. Vivekananda went there. He came back. He said, "What is the wrong in meat-eating?" He introduced meat-eating amongst his contemporary <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> This is his <span class="Italic">vedānta-pracāra.</span> So he is advertised that he preached Vedānta all over America, and everyone has become Vedantist. What is...? What kind of Vedantist? Now, he introduced meat-eating amongst the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> which was never in India, any... There are two sets of <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> the Śaṅkara <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> and Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> But their <span class="Italic">ācāra</span> is the same. They may differ in philosophy, but their <span class="Italic">ācāra</span> is the same. Rather, the Śaṅkara <span class="Italic">sampradāya sannyāsī</span> are more strict than the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Śaṅkara <span class="Italic">sampradāya sannyāsī,</span> they'll never occupy a seat, those who are strictly following. They'll sit down on the floor. Without any <span class="Italic">āsana.</span> They lie down on the floor. They are so renounced. And what is this, that <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> smoking and drinking? And ordinary <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they are drinking also tea, one ghara (?). I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> Now Rajneesh gives <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsinī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsinī,</span> woman <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It's just a mockery. He's not making any <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He's not <span class="Italic">sannyāsa;</span> he just gives name <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Neo<span class="Italic">-sannyāsa</span> he called it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they dress like <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They dress, but they smoke <span class="Italic">biḍi,</span> they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, <span class="Italic">nava-sannyāsa.</span> They say, <span class="Italic">nava-sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Neo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neo-<span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There were three or four of them came to stay at the guest house in Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma guest house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Husband and wife <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. They were saying, "I am <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and my brother is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and my wife is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> but my mother-in-law, she is not <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Kali-yuga. Rascals, they are doing anything and any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And he also has written <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> his own <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's five to seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us go down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
