<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...can dance, and as soon as you say, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance," immediately they reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stop. They spend hours and hours practicing how to learn to dance. They go through so much <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> In Mauritius on Diwali there was a very big festival the government arranged. There were more than forty thousand people, and they got one singer, Mukesh, from India, especially for that program. So when he was singing everybody was making noise. As soon as the Hare Kṛṣṇa people went on the stage everybody become quiet. Everybody was clapping, they were telling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Kalākendra.</span> Here is <span class="Italic">kalākendra,</span> there is <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This area is full of <span class="Italic">kalākendras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This corner is something American?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> This used to be the U.S.I.S. but now this is closed. This is another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This has become another <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> This is also part of the <span class="Italic">Bharatiya kalākendra</span> now. The U.S.I.S. used to be here, American information... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> New Delhi is a very social city. There are a lot of <span class="Italic">kalākendras</span> so there's a lot of active...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because the government servant, they haven't got to earn money. It is father's property. They are getting money and balance time, <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span> And government servant means (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No work. Especially in this country. Sixty percent of the government servants, they sleep. They do not do anything. I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're reading papers or gossiping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gossiping, that's all. And keeping the files thrown away. If you want some reference, it will take three months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> That one devotee who was given <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> initiation, he was working in the government. So previously he would just go in the morning, and sometimes he wouldn't even go. His section officer would go... One of them would go and punch in and the rest of the day... They have no work even. And then in the evening one has to cover the punch out. That's the only thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In the communistic system everybody works very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's what they claim, but everything belongs to the state. Why should they work hard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They work very hard because they have a gun pointed at their head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now the Russians are gradually trying to change to the American system in the sense that if a worker produces more, he is given some bonus. They are trying to give incentives to the workers so that they are tempted to work hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what they will do with the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just buy a little more vodka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Go on vacation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is equality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> That's why the Chinese and the Russians don't get along. The Chinese say that the Russians have diverted from Marxism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will have to divert because both, either Chinese or Russian, these are all rascaldom. It is not perfect system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the chairman of the Russian Communist Party, Mr. Brezhnev, he has about fifteen foreign cars. Each time a foreign dignitary goes, he gives him a special car. So everyone is supposed to be equal, but he is not equal. He has fifteen cars for himself. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...clean city. [break] It is not the same New Delhi as five or ten years before. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long you are here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Five years, four and a half years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Everything is deteriorating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Vṛndāvana is much cleaner than this, and they are supposed to be very poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in Vṛndāvana there are less rascals and here it is full of rascals. That is the difference. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> Rascal means the nondevotees. They have no good qualification. <span class="Italic">Kuto:</span> "Where is good qualification?" And "No, they are so civilized. They are educated." But the answer is, <span class="Italic">mano-rathena:</span> "Whatever they may be, they are on the mental platform." <span class="Italic">Mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ:</span> "Because they are on the mental platform, certainly they will hover over the external energy. Therefore they have no good qualification." <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-maninaḥ.</span> Simply speculating on the external feature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Mental platform means speculation, mental platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Mental platform means speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Na sukhaṁ na paraṁ gatim.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paraṁ gatim.</span> They do not take instruction from the <span class="Italic">śāstra;</span> therefore everything is failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nobody seems very happy in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither in U.S.A. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No one is happy in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> In America there is much more violence than there is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I read in the papers yesterday that the crime rate has gone up in United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That must. If everyone is a criminal, so how the crime rate can decrease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Everybody cheats as much as possible, on income tax and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even President Nixon had cheated on his income tax return, but they caught him later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not cheating. It is... The income tax department is a cheating department, so everyone tries to avoid this cheating department. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes. People hire lawyers, very expensive lawyers, just to find loopholes in their tax statements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The cheating begins from the government. They are giving some paper and asking people, "Here is ten thousand dollars." This is cheating. "I promise to pay." But when the government is failure, where is the promise? Who pays? This is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> During the Depression that happened. People lined up for miles. During the Depression in America people lined up for miles outside of the bank, and the bank couldn't give them any money. And even if they had money, it wouldn't buy anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Previously the governments all over the world would guarantee that for behind every currency there was certain amount of gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if you went and gave that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now it's no more. Now if you go with that currency the government won't give you gold. They've reduced the gold backing behind the currency now. Every day they're reducing because when they want money they just print more notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you cannot hold gold also. That is illegal. Somehow or other, even if you secure gold, you cannot keep it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's that restriction in India, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Now in the United States you can buy gold. They made it legal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But limited quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not believe in the transmigration of the soul and they are "Awake." Just see these rascals. They have no preliminary knowledge even, and they are writing books, <span class="Italic">Awake.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have a very big press in New York, Jehovah Witness, Brooklyn Bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They say the world is going to end next year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then they also say if it doesn't end next year, that it's Biblically correct to say that it may end in three years after that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then again seven years. Then again ten years. They are so awakened. So rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can ask them to sell their press to us because the world is going to end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, give us free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have a huge press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We can make a wager with them. If it doesn't end, then they have to surrender their press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How much they are in darkness, and they are making propaganda, "Awake." This is going on. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīya...</span> One blind man is awakening other blind men. [break] ...<span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of the <span class="Italic">kendras</span> are supported by businessmen. They would much rather support a <span class="Italic">kalākendra</span> rather than the temple because they think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple is useless now. You see, Nanda has spent so much money in that Kurukṣetra, and not a single temple. You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> There is no temple in Kurukṣetra where they are worshiping Kṛṣṇa like we are worshiping. There is no temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The Gauḍīya Math?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Even they can't worship as we are worshiping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can worship? The worship is done by devotee. Unless you create devotee, where is the question of worshiping? Without devotee it is idol worship. There is no life. And without life, how can you pull on artificially? <span class="Italic">Aprāṇasya hi dehasya mandanam loka-rañjanam.</span> Which way I shall go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Go to the left or... Left. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In the back of that <span class="Italic">Awake</span> magazine there was one little article that said that this one teacher in one college was doing yoga. He locked himself up in his room and went into a yogic trance, and they finally broke into his room two days later and found him in the same position but dead. So then they say that because he was in yogic trance that his heart was going too slow to give sufficient blood to the body, so he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So by yoga practice he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, that's what they're saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The result is he's died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> My father, he read that article, and that's what he says to me. He says, "You do yoga and you'll end up like this man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are government buildings. They are not properly maintained. The roads are not properly maintained. So New Delhi light is diminishing. And the shabby motor buses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These buses are also so old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Old and creating sound so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> They are losing several crores of rupees every year. One man told me that he rents buses to them, one of the men who came two, three days ago. So, he was telling before, he rents buses to the D.T.C., to the Delhi Transportation Corporation. He rents it to them for a rupee a kilometer and he makes about forty paisa. And even though they are getting it for a rupee a kilometer, they are still losing money on it. He is making profit and they are losing it. Because they sell the spare parts. They're so corrupt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take away the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Yes, the workers there... There's about sixty percent of their buses only, running. Forty percent are disabled because they are always losing the parts somehow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also, I know, in Delhi, what the people do is... A lot of people, they don't buy the ticket. They give the conductor half the money, and so he lets them go free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Then where the income? There is no income and there is loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not everyone does it, but students and a lot of young people do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Students coerce them. They stop the buses. If the bus driver doesn't stop, they'll break the windows and then they all get on and they ride free. They were burning many buses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this year, because of the emergency, everyone is behaving all right. They're scared to do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How by emergency you can make people honest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This house belongs to the (name withheld).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> This belongs to (name withheld)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He has got three, four houses like that, separate, I saw, and whole day-two hours here, two hours there, two hours there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> He had seven wives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> A house for each wife, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another madman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> All his children are avowed atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means children are born by others. He feeds them. That's all. This is going on. [break] It is easily calculated that government will collapse very soon. They have made changes because they cannot manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also they try to change their image. They'll always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Every six months they've been changing the ministers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means mismanagement. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They do this all over the world. They change... Like in America, President Ford just dropped the Defense Secretary just like that. So that created such a big controversy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I read a very interesting article, and the theme was that once a month, every month at least, one government is now collapsing or being overthrown. That was the theme of the article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> In U.P. they change the government after every two, three months. Yesterday also they make authorization to rule in U.P. from yesterday. They change the government like that after every few months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now Dr. Channa Reddy must have become busy because when the presidents rule then the governor has to do some work. Otherwise in India the governors, they do no work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> He takes instruction from president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In America in the upcoming elections in 1976, one of the biggest candidates is a movie actor, Ronald Reagan. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For presidentship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> For presidentship. And he stands a very good chance of winning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's governor of California. [break] The movie stars are entering into politics now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the government will be incompetent, the more the citizens will be exploited. Ultimately the citizens will suffer. Because they will want money and plunder the citizens, they will be disgusted. <span class="Italic">Āchinna-dāra-draviṇ gacchanti giri-kānanam.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> ...tax division, the clerks will come to the various businessmen after they make their first application, and they will tell them... First they will come to them. And immediately a businessman knows, so he gives him 500,000 rupees. And he will say, "Oh, thank you very much. I just came to see you. I wanted to tell you that if you say like this, you will save ten thousand, twenty thousand rupees. But don't say when you are there that I told you." (end)</div>
