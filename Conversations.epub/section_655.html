<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...tree you collected the <span class="Italic">dantana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Which tree did you collect the twigs from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Oh, over by your apartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What is that tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> It was a fir tree. Fir wood. It's a type of pine tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. It is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> OK. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This tree is very common?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes. There are quite a few around Michigan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have seen the tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You collect the wood. [break] ...monkey in this country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, no wild monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Only civilized monkeys. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> We(?) are living in the cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least civilized man's forefather. [break] ...bigger than monkey. You remember? We were walking in that park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes. Many were in the trees, jumping. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birds who eat monkey. You know that? I have seen in Los Angeles zoo, monkey-eating bird. They capture the monkey by the neck and drop it. And when it falls down it dies, and meat. And I have seen one statue in the Central Park. They are catching goats-eagle. And there are big eagles. They catch up elephant. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Just some person who wants(?) to glorify himself, Dudder.(?) [break] A boy will write his name and his girlfriend's name on some tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So their love will live as long as the tree. Maybe they will also become trees. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...thinks of woman at the time of death, he becomes woman. And if a woman thinks of man at the time of death, she becomes man. [break] ...afraid of men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> I don't think that they will let you go too close, but I don't know... Someone told me yesterday that people come out here and shoot them with bows and arrows and take them home and eat them. So they are not safe even here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...interested to see us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...deer. They are just off the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. "No standing"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> For the cars. The cars should not remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Car is "parking," they say? Or "standing"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "Standing" means if the person remains inside. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> I spoke to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa on the phone the other day, and he asked me to tell you that we're sending 64,000 to your book fund for this month. And he said also he promises you 100,000 per month by the end of the year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good news. (aside:) Good morning. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> ...and to tell you that he will be distributing over fourteen thousand of your big books every month, 125,000 of your <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads,</span> and at least ten thousand of your medium size books, like the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> trilogy book or the <span class="Italic">Beyond Birth and Death,</span> those books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is going over Tripurāri?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Well, Tripurāri is also with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Including both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Yes, both. Now, what is happening, Tripurāri is training some of our men in the airports. He is training nine new men to distribute big books in the airports, men who were before distributing only the magazines. Now they will go to the airports and learn how to distribute the big books. And also some of Tripurāri's men have taken over the leadership of our parties to help the new men to distribute also. So that way they are cooperating. (end)</div>
