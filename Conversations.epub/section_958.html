<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Laboring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You say not separating but liberating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not liberating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I didn't understand your repl...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Could you repeat the question again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Many people say that members of the International Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Society are being cut off from work in the world and therefore their contributions to the world are being lost to the world and I wondered how you felt about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But they have misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That is true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficulty is they do not understand on which platform we are working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How would you describe that platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you or me or anyone, this living condition is one platform and when I or you, we are dead, that is another platform. So generally people are working on the bodily concept of platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What kind of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bodily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Oh, bodily, walking on the, yes yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are working on the spiritual platform. Just like what is the distinction between a dead man and a living man? There is some distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So those who are working on the bodily platform, they are working on the dead platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Does that involve a majority of the people, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone. It is a little difficult. Try to understand, that this body, so long the living force is there, the body is important. Do you follow it or not? This body is important how long? So long the life is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Sure. What I'm trying to get at is you say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll understand, just try to understand me. That this body is important so long the life is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right, I agree with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this body minus life, what is the value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> None whatever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This body minus life, what is the value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He said none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> None, no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Except as fertilizer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are working on that platform where the life is there. And people in general they are working on the platform of this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> On the platform of, on the dead platform? You say people in general...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body is dead. Body is dead. Just like your shirt. It is dead always. Either on your body or hanging on the hanger. Your shirt and coat, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> My shirt and coat are dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But my body is not dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body is not because the living force is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right. But people in general you say are walking on the dead platform in live bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Oh working. Oh, working on the dead platform in live bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dead, you don't talk, you don't talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> (laughs) He, Prabhupāda has explained to you previously that those who identify on the bodily concept, because the body itself is dead without the soul, it is considered the dead platform. Because the body itself without the soul is dead, whereas we are concentrating on the platform of life, the life within the body, the soul. So that is the platform of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well is that what makes the people make this distinction between the life you are leading and the life of the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because we are working in different platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are working on the live platform and general people, they are working on the dead platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So in a sense the movement involves a rejection of the general world activities and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not rejection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...separation from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not rejection. Just like your car. Your car is important so long it is moving. But if it does not move, then what is the importance of the car? Motor car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not, if it's not in use it's serving no purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly if you simply concentrate on the car without any attention to the car driver, then what is your knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> It takes both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> It takes both, the car and the driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Car is important so long it is moving and if it is not moving it has no importance, it is lump of matter. So the car in both the condition, while moving and not moving, it is lump of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well does that mean that the world, the general world's activities are like a non-moving car? A lump of matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And that's why the Kṛṣṇa movement is separate, separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Appears to be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Appears to be separate from the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...is that the proper word, how would you put that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How would you put it, that "We are..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We are also utilizing the car but our attention is on the life principle, not on the dead metal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Appears to be separated, that's the way you would put it. Well, is it separated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is always separated. It is always separated. Just like the driver and the car, they are always separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I'm talking about the movement, from the secular world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, understand the analogy. The car and the driver is always separated. The driver is not car, neither the car is the driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, is the Kṛṣṇa movement the driver or the car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you bring Kṛṣṇa? First of all, try to understand the analogy. There is car and there is the driver. That car is always different from the driver and the driver is always different from the car. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Absolutely. The car can't drive itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if you take attention of the car and you do not know anything about the driver, then what is your knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I didn't quite get the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> If you pay attention to the car without paying attention to understanding who the driver of the car is, what is the driver, then what is the use of your knowledge? In other words, the driver is the living entity or the soul and the car is this body, the material elements of this material world including the body. So without understanding who you are, who the living entity within the body or the driver within the car, then what is the use of your knowledge of the material elements without understanding who you are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, since this dichotomy appears to be the case, I mean that there is, that the movement is sort of cut off from the world in general, does that not deprive the world of the service, of the usefulness of these people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, if you do not understand what is the movement then how you can give your verdict like that? First of all, try to understand what is this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, the Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is that Kṛṣṇa movement? That Kṛṣṇa movement is, just like to understand the driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The Kṛṣṇa movement is meant to help people to understand the spiritual knowledge, knowledge of who they actually are. That is what our movement is dedicated to. We are not dedicated for our own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What is the purpose of the movement, your Grace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purpose of the movement is to know who is the driver of the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> To know who is the driver of the car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, we are contributing. People are in ignorance about his own identification, who is he. He's thinking he's dead body. That is misconception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> There's no way to identify the driver of the car then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see it is so difficult subject matter. I am speaking to you, still you feel difficulty. It is little difficult subject matter. We say the car and driver, if you understand this analogy, the car and the driver, so who is important? The driver is important, the car is important. Both combined together giving a service, the car is moving. But if they are separated, who is important, the car is important or the driver is important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I don't know how I'm going to get the point you're making there across. If the car and the driver are separated, the car is useless and the driver is a person. The driver is always important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, driver is always important. Within the car or without the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Within or without the car, and if he's a chauffeur driving a carload of people then he becomes less important, the people are primarily the ones that are important, that are in the car. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all try to understand the car is moving with the help of the driver. So the driver and the car they are always different identity. So when the car is dead, the driver do not work with the car, but the driver is important within the car or without the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In other words, the soul is important with this body or without this body. But the body without the soul is simply fertilizer, like you said, it's dead, useless. So our mission is to educate people about the driver, about the soul within the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people are generally working on the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> People are generally working on the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we are working on the driver of the body. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Working on the driver of the body. On the spirit, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, on the spirit soul. And because they do not know what is the difference between the soul and the body, they cannot understand what is our contribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Because they do not understand the difference between the soul and the body, that's why they don't understand what you are contributing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Contribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We're going to give you a transcript.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Do you think that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, just you try. We are trying to give enlightenment about the driver of the car. Because the driver of the car is always important, either on the car or without the car. And people in general they are giving importance to the car only. They have no knowledge of the driver. The car requires petrol and the driver requires nice food. So people in general, when they see that we are not giving petrol to the driver, they are surprised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> When they see that you are not giving a role to the driver?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Petrol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Oh, petrol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think that petrol is the food of the driver. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In other words to satisfy the body does not satisfy the person within the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they misunderstand, "Oh, they are not giving petrol to this man for eating." But the man's eatable is not the petrol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I would like to ask you another question, your Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have understood this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, have you understood this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Have you understood the analogy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I accept, ah, I suppose what you are saying is that the driver...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to understand, you have to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...that the driver is the spirit of man and that the car is his physical functioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So the car requires petrol. Does it mean the driver also requires petrol?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You mean the spirit? Food? Does the spirit require food?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This analogy. The driver's food is different from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Body food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from the petr..., of the motor car. The motor car without petrol cannot work. Similarly, the driver without food cannot work. But the food of the driver and the power of the motor car different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The needs of the body and soul are different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are supplying the needs of the soul, and they are supplying the needs of the motor car. Therefore they find difference. They are thinking, "They are not supplying petrol to this man for eating." That is the difference. They are crying, "Oh, they are not giving petrol for eating to the driver."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Actually we are giving all those things as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are supplying everything, driver's food and the car's power. But they see that, "Why they are wasting time giving food to the driver?" They think that petrol is the food of the driver as well as the car. They do not know that the food of the driver is different from the petrol for the car. Try to understand this analogy. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I gather what you are driving at is that bodily food is different than, mental, reading, intellectual food, spiritual food, it all comes into the body and we take it all information, ideas, this is the kind...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not ideas, that is a fact. Fact that you driver, you must have your food. Otherwise you will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I'm looking at you, that's taking in a certain kind of information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot drive the car without food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You have all kinds of information that you have to have to survive. To get down the sidewalk without running into the building you've got to see the wall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sum and substance is that if a person thinks that he is the car, the driver, if he thinks wrongly that he is the car, then his life is spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> So if someone identifies too closely with the body, then his life is spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You think, if he identifies with the body too much his life is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> At all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He should know that he is different from the car. That is real knowledge. And if he identifies himself with the car, then he's a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, can he, is he supposed to care about and honor the body in the physical world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...and to see that, see the physical world as important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if you are utilizing this coat, you are taking care of it, but if you think that you are coat, then you are doomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> If you use the body you should take care of it but if you think that you are the body, then you are doomed, then it is foolishness. But you naturally you take care of the body, but you should still don't identify with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well you know, Your Grace, the spiritual quality is an important part of life of course...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise the animal. If the man does not understand the value of his spiritual quality then he's no better than the dog. The dog does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What do you think of Jimmy Carter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Jimmy Carter is the Presidential candidate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. What is the (indistinct) is I do not know, neither I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not aware of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Doesn't care about politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But isn't, that's part of what I'm thinking about, that you and your movement tend to separate people from concern with what's going on in the world, like that's a Presidential election and Jimmy Carter is the democratic candidate. This is a disregard of what's going on in the world. Isn't that an example of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the thing is that there were many Presidents before, what is this name of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Jimmy Carter. He is not President yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ford is the president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ford. So what improvement you have done by having this President or that President? What improvement you'll make unless some false promise? That's all. What is the improvement? You have changed so many hundreds and thousands of Presidents, but what is the improvement about spiritual knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Prabhupāda sees everything spiritually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's seeing everything spiritually. What is the improvement spiritually out of all these Presidents? So therefore we do not care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You do not care what the President...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We take care, but we take care more for the spirit soul than the body. That is our basic principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But do you think most of the Hare Kṛṣṇa members will vote in the election in November?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're attending? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's asking if you think that they will vote, our members will vote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Will they participate in the election? Will they register and vote do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Personally I never give votes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Never voted. You're a citizen however, aren't you, a U.S. citizen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am permanent resident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Permanent resident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immigrant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well will they follow your example and not vote?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know, but our principle is that I vote for this man or that man, so what is spiritual benefit, that is our point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> If he was Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he might vote. If the politician is God conscious, then we'll support him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Vote for this man or that, what spiritual difference would it make, is that the way you put that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, as long as the candidate is not God conscious it wouldn't make any difference which way we vote, but if he's God conscious, then we'll vote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, would he have to be in the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement to be God conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Would the candidate, in order for a candidate to be God conscious, would he have to be part of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He must know the science, this science, this spiritual science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> To be God conscious, you must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a great science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Great science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In order to understand God it is a great science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Do you need to be involved in the Kṛṣṇa movement to be God conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may take part in the movement or not but he must know the science. Movement is preaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You mean the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he must know that or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> or anything, but he must... Just like a book, mathematics, it may be written by different men, but one must be a mathematician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I think what Bali was saying is that if a Kṛṣṇa consciousness member were running for an office then you would get out and vote for him. That he would be God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But I'm trying to ask does he have to be Kṛṣṇa conscious, involvement, in order to be God conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone should be Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone should be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Not only the... President or not President, everyone, that is the objective of human life. He must know himself what he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now, that leads up to another question I wanted to ask you, do you think that the, one of the attractions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the rather exotic, Hindu, unusual customs in the West. I mean these customs are unusual in the West and they have a sort of exotic appeal, a fascination for young people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that ignorance is there both in Western and Eastern. It is the ignorance of the human society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But do you think it's unusual, the fact that it's an Eastern, mysterious Eastern religion has an appeal to American young people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you bring Eastern religion Western religion? It is a science. Two plus two is equally important both in the East and the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, it originated in the East and it's not very, it hasn't been customary in the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That originated... Just like the sun rises in India first. That does not mean the sun in America and the sun in India is different. The sun is the same sun. It may appear first in the Eastern side but that sun does not belong either to the East or the West. Sun is sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well do you think that the Eastern sun, meaning Hare Kṛṣṇa, is appropriate in a culture that has a different religion traditionally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is ignorance. Why do you say...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> The Jewish, Biblical Christian tradition is traditional in the West, the Hindu tradition...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I never said that Jewish or Christian or Hindu or Muslim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We aren't Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not belong either to the Hindus or Christian or Jewish. We belong to Kṛṣṇa or God. Kṛṣṇa means God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yeah, but you use the Hindu scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Just like we say the sun, <span class="Italic">sūrya</span> and you say the sun, the "sun." But the subject matter is the same. You say the sun in the sky as s-u-n, "sun." And we say in India <span class="Italic">sūrya. S-ū-r-y-a.</span> So the name may be different but the object is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In other words, do you think the India-originated religion is, serves its particular purpose in the Western society? I mean, does, is it of particular value in a rather technological society, the Hindu tradition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally speaking, everywhere, everyone everywhere is identifying his body as the self. It does not mean East or West. This is ignorance. Wherever there is ignorance one identifies himself with the body. This is ignorance. It may be in the East or in the West. It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, can a self exist without a body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Self can exist without body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I mean you say that people identify themselves, the body as the self.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And that this is ignorance to identify the self with the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained, that the driver...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But does that mean a sort of rejection of the body as unimportant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not rejection. Again, you come to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But the body is important to the self isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just try to understand. That we have already explained. The driver and the car are two different identities, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The driver can exist without the car and the car without the driver has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, in that sense...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you understand first of all this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...in keeping with that analogy can the self exist, does the self exist without the body in this world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In this life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Life is always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> As a spirit apart from the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That is the ideal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> That is the goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the goal. When the soul lives without this material body, that is his liberated life. Just like the criminal, he can live within the jail and without the jail. But he's thinking wrongly that without jail he cannot live. But his life without jail is real life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That reflects the old, the Hindu view that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you again bring Hindu view?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Or, the, at least the Eastern religious view, that to leave this life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why we are bringing Hindu and Muslim view?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, O.K., I take that back then. I take that back. Anyway, what you're saying is that this life is a jail and that really the goal is another life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right? I mean that this life is an evil prison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, now you have understood. This is not a desirable life, to live in the jail, conditioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well in other words, in a sense that is to reject or at least to repudiate this life, this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not repudiate, to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That it is not a good life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not a good life, and the whole material world is false identification with myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well is it important to try to improve this life so that it won't be a prison?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, improve, improve, to understand that I am not a person of the jail. I am a person of freedom. Long living in the jail one who identifies that "Without jail I cannot live."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, I hope we all get out of it sometime, somehow, someway, either here or there.(laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are trying to educate the prisoners that "Your life is not perfect within the jail. Your life is perfect without the jail." This is our education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Life is not perfect in the jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the person in the jail they are thinking, "What is this, they are not working for the jail life?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Person in the jail, I didn't get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they cannot understand that there is life after jail. They are so fool, rascal that they cannot understand that without jail one can live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> So what you were saying before, the persons in the jail are thinking "These people are not working for life in the jail," so they don't understand what we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How's that now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We're not working to keep people in the jail conception of life. So that's why they cannot understand what we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You mean you're not working for the jail life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> To keep people within the conception that life is within the jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a man has gone to jail, he's giving education to the prisoners, "My dear brother prisoners, this life is not good, you become honest, don't come to the jail." So other prisoners, they are working hard, they are hammering on the bricks, they think that "This man is not hammering on the bricks, he's talking only."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I didn't gather that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In the prison the people are, their work is, say, to hammer on bricks. So when, if someone comes into the jail and tells the prisoners, "You shouldn't be doing this, actually you should become honest and go out of the jail and be free." Now if the persons in the jail... Because... They will then become envious that "this person, instead of working hard like us, he's simply talking." They cannot understand the benefit that he's giving them and they become envious, that "Because he's not working like us he is nonsense." So do you understand the analogy? It's an analogy. Just like we are coming in the world and telling people to get out of this world, to understand the spiritual world, spiritual side of life. But because we're not working like them, sometimes they misunderstand what is our purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In other words you think people should get away from what they're doing in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, that is real life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! (laughs) (someone comes in?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That they really shouldn't concentrate so completely on the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. So long you are in the jail, you have to work according to the principle of the jail but you must know that jail life is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> You may work within the material world but you have to understand that the purpose is to get out of the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer: :</span>Well, are your Kṛṣṇa members out of the, out of jail?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like, some of us are working like the hammerman, breaking bricks with hammer, but that does not mean he does not understand. So long one is in the jail, one is not in freedom, he has to work like that by force. But that is not his proper work. He has got a different work outside the jail or in his freedom life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, what people are saying about the members of the Kṛṣṇa society is that they are not doing the jail work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained. The prisoner who is hammering the bricks, he's thinking that this man is simply instructing that you have a different life outside the jail, he's not hammering on the brick. Therefore he is surprised, "How is that he is not hammering like me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In other words, he's not participating in jail life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's educating them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What's he doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's educating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> He's trying to show them a different way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not different way, he's educating differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> So they can understand what they're doing, what they're supposed to be doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> He's educating them to what? That this jail life is no good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That the jail life is no good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But then is that man that's hammering the bricks, isn't he going to quit hammering the bricks, too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may not hammer, he's giving instruction. Just like I was invited in Ahmedabad jail to give some instruction. So I'm not hammering on the bricks because I was in the jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> No, you're giving instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I'm meant for giving instruction, I am not meant for hammering on the bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But then once you get this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the person who is hammering on the bricks, he's thinking that "This man is simply talking."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That's why he thinks that the Kṛṣṇa people are separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to draw him in the business of hammering bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Of hammering bricks. Right, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That's the difference. Well, what I'm talking about is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's thinking that "He's not contributing in hammering the bricks." But he does not know that this hammering on the bricks is not a very good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not a very good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not know, the rascal, who is trying to bring us also in the business of hammering the bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> (simultaneously) of hammering the bricks, that's right. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes. Well when you get through with, talking, instructing the man hammering the bricks, is he going to lay down his hammer, too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he doesn't require. The same... You try to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He may continue hammering, but his knowledge will be complete. He'll have complete understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least he must know that "This hammering is my punishment." He knows that "This hammering is not by business, it is my punishment." That is knowledge, that is knowledge. When a prisoner understands that "This hammering business is not my real business, it is my punishment."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Isn't that a rather negative way to look at the work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why negative? It is the fact. That is the positive understanding. Why do you take negative? If you are suffering and if you say, if I say, "Don't suffer," is that negative or that is positive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In other words, if you are suffering and I tell you "Don't suffer," it may sound negative but actually it's positive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, positive. But they are rascals, they are taking as negative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Why is work in the world necessarily suffering? It is, it has, a mixture of pain and joy but it's negative to look on it as useless work. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are envious of the Kṛṣṇa conscious men. They do not see that "These people, they are not hammering like us." So therefore they are thinking that there is no contribution of hammering. They think the hammering is the real business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That's pretty good. (laughter) I think people understand the analogy, they think hammering is the business. What do you think is the business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> The world thinks hammering is real business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so our business is to educate them that "Your hammering business is not your life. Your freedom is real business."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Freedom is what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You've, I'm sure you've heard or read about these claims by these parent groups that claim that the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement members are, ah, sort of controlled by intensive indoctrination? Brain-washed they call it, you know, by getting up and having the two hours or three of chanting in the morning and prayer beads constantly and the group life, that they're sort of controlled, and denied their freedom. What do you say about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is due to misunderstanding. They do not understand what kind of preaching, what kind of education we are giving. We are giving education how to become free from the hammering business in the jail. They think hammering business and keep oneself within the jail is the real life because they have been accustomed to that. And when we speak that "Hammering or to keep within the jail is not your real business: your real business is freedom," naturally they find contradiction, and they think that we are doing something against their business. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Like doing something against their what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Against their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But in other words you think that there, is there not something to this idea of brain, of being spiritually controlled or spiritually directed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not controlled, it is not controlled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, what would you call it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Controlling one from coming to the jail life. If you give good instruction to a man, that "Don't become criminal, don't come to the jail, don't be engaged in the hammering business," it appears negative, but that is positive life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> If you tell someone not to do something that's bad for him, it's positive for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his positive life. When the physician says to a patient that "Don't eat like this, then you will increase your diabetes. Don't eat this, don't eat starch, don't eat sugar." So people may think he's simply giving negative, but that is his positive life. They misunderstand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I guess when you started out down here in Greenwich Village in 1965 you didn't have any idea that your movement was going to become the rather large movement it is. Did you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because my movement is real movement, positive. Any intelligent man will understand and take it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...planning a trip to India soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm planning to India, and from India to Europe, that is my business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Travels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I travel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I mean you aren't leaving this country for good. You're a permanent resident, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I don't know, I just heard that somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I don't know, somebody said it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can I answer this? Somebody madman must have said it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer: :</span>I'm just checking it out, but there's nothing to it, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am touring always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's always traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Where is your main home?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My home is back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> With God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my real home. That means every temple is my home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Did you work out the spiritual disciplines for the group yourself? I mean about the morning chanting and the recital of the two thousand Hare Kṛṣṇas a day and... Did you work those out yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still I am working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Still working, on those disciplines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you see, I have got, these men, they have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's saying did you think of these things yourself, to chant on the beads and follow the program in the morning, have you made these up yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the disciplic process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Disciplic process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, who originated those steps?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is since time immemorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Time immemorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you'll find, <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well I understand you do a lot of work translating and that you only sleep two hours a day. Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not two hours, I sleep about four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Four hours? Four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> ...verse Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>nitya-yuktā upāsate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.14]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this was spoken five thousand years ago and we are doing the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now what's your, what's your...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now your answer is there, it is not that I invented something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, you didn't invent it, I get the point, that it derives from the Vedic scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever we are doing, it is authorized. That is the principle for spiritual understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What I was trying to ask you a while ago, do you think that these particular Vedic disciplines and spiritual principles, concentration on the spirit instead of the body, has a particular usefulness in Western society nowadays?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is useful for every human being. If the Western society thinks that they are not human being, that is another thing. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In other words, this is the business of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What's your view of Judaism and Christianity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have not studied, but any "ism," if it is meant for making the soul free from this bodily condition, that is first class "ism." Otherwise, it is simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Any religion that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That gives facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Emphasizes making us free from the bodily condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That's a first class religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I don't think Judaism and Christianity do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> They consider the body very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again you come to the same. Body is important so long the soul is there. The car is important so long it is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But they don't, they cherish the physical, you know, the world itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is ignorance, that is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got students from every community. From Jewish community, from Christian community, from Muhammadan community, from Buddhist community, from Hindu community, everywhere. Because the knowledge is for everyone. It doesn't matter whether he's Jewish, Christian or... "Two plus two equal to four" is good for everyone. It is not that "two plus two" is good for the Christians, not for the Jews. Gold is gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I didn't get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The principle of, say, "two plus two equals four," is the same for a person whether he's Christian, Jewish, Muhammadan or whatever. Just as the same way that gold is gold. Gold always has it's value in any situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say because gold is in the hand of a Muhammadan it is Muhammadan gold, or if it is in the hand of a Christian it is Christian gold. Gold is gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In anyone's hand. You cannot designate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Who's got the gold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Everyone has got the gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Who has the gold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone has got the gold, but they have, they are not in awareness that what is that gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Everyone has the gold. They are simply unaware that they have it. Everyone is originally Kṛṣṇa conscious or God conscious. What Prabhupāda is doing is making people aware of it, that it's within them, within their heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, are there other paths to awareness of spirit consciousness other than the Kṛṣṇa consciousness path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, how can I say? That is your subject matter. You study both of them and see and give your judgement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What is your view? Are there other paths to spirit consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is, but not very elaborate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> There are but not very what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Elaborate, scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very elaborate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not very good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very elaborate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Elaborate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well is Kṛṣṇa consciousness very elaborate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> By elaborate you mean effective, is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You mean effective by elaborate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Effective also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I mean is that the proper synonym for elaborate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> These are some of our books that Prabhupāda has published just to explain this science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are explaining this science in so many books. It is open to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That's quite a library.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is just the beginning. And there's another forty volumes after this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Are all of these translations that you've made Your Grace? I don't blame you for sleeping only four hours a night. I tell you, just to produce a half a dozen books in a lifetime is quite a job you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult, but I have already produced eighty books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Eighty? Eighty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighty books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Eighty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighty. Eight zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Translations of the Vedic scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> And commentaries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Translation and commentaries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And all world scholars, professors, universities, they are receiving so nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We have standing orders for all of Prabhupāda's books that he has now and in the future, all over the world in all the leading universities and the professors are using them as texts. We have hundreds of letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see some of the lists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What I've heard, what I've heard some Hindu professors say is that Hinduism is such a complex and profound religion and that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness members are very superficial about it. They simply go through these disciplines and really don't involve themselves in the... They take a superficial version of Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be Hindu religion. But we do not belong to any religion. That may be true for the Hindu religion what the professor has said, but we do not identify with any religion. We are different from any religious system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But the scriptures are the same, the Vedic scriptures are Hindu scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Hindu religion... Of course, the scripture is the Vedic principle, but the word is not Vedic. This word Hindu is not Vedic word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Hindu is not Sanskrit, it's just a popular, general term.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic, <span class="Italic">Vedas, Vedas,</span> that is real, the word. But they have taken it in a different way. Actually the "Hindu," this name is given by the neighbor Muhammadans. There is a river called Sindhu. That river is still there, it is now in Pakistan. So outside the border of India, the Muhammadans, they used to call the inhabitants of the neighborhood of that river Sindhu, Hindu. Because they pronounce s as h. So this is the origin. So "Hindu" is a title given by the Muhammadan neighbors. It is not found in the Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I see, I see. That's like most religious names derived quite often out of ridicule or scorn. Like the Quakers, that was originally a title of scorn. And Methodists, they were the methodical ones, that was a title of scorn. And the Baptists were the baptizers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real Vedic principle is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> Observing the principle of four <span class="Italic">varṇas. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya.</span> It is a very long science. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">varṇa.</span> And <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> So the Vedic civilization is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> not Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> This is later contribution of the so-called scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well ah, I thank you very much for your time, your Grace, and I'm glad I finally got acquainted with you. I missed you in Brooklyn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I missed you in Brooklyn, I came over there and you were in the backyard, I think you were asleep or having a backrub or something. So I didn't get to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in the daytime I am...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> It was good to catch you this time and I hope to see you again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So kindly put the matter properly because people misunderstand on account of their ignorance they misunderstand our, movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What are their main misunderstandings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This bodily concept. They are thinking that they are body. "I am Muhammadan, I am Christian, I am American, I am Eastern, I am Western," all bodily conceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You mean about the Eastern and Western?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eastern, Western, that is also bodily conception. Why they are thinking Eastern, Western? Everyone is human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, what is it that they particularly understand, misunderstand about the movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not understand that we are talking on the spiritual platform and they are on the material bodily platform. Therefore they find contradiction. One has to be little sober to understand this movement and what platform we are speaking. They are accustomed, on the same example, hammering the bricks. And when they see others, they are not hammering the bricks, they think they are different. They cannot understand that life can be without hammering the bricks. <span class="Italic">Karmīs.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the word <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> that has been explained by Viśvanātha Cakravartī, <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> these <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> They cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I'm going to have to go back and hammer a few bricks. (laughter) It's been a pleasure, thank you very much, for your time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Give him <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Thank you again, I hope to see you again sometime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Good day. (end)</div>
