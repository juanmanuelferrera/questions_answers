<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...your <span class="Italic">devatā</span> finished. But your relationship with Kṛṣṇa will never finish<span class="Italic">-nityo nityānāṁ-</span>because you are <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> That relationship, we have to reestablish that relation. That is the function of the human body. If you are simply busy with this temporary nature, then you are losing time. The temporary relationship will... Just like I came here; now, tomorrow I am going. So, say, for fortnight the relation was there. Now you'll have another relation. Similarly, after this body I do not know what relation, what father, mother, I will get and what relation will be established. What community will be established I do not know. And then I will forget. Now those who are Indian, but suppose in his last birth he was Chinaman. He has forgotten. Now he's fighting for India's cause. If the Chinaman is fighting for China's cause. This is disease. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches, <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are ready to serve all the <span class="Italic">dayitas</span>(?), but eternal servitude is Kṛṣṇa. That we have to establish. Then <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then, after leaving this body, he has no more to accept this material body and create another society, another family, another relationship, another atmosphere. So because we are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, in Kṛṣṇa society, therefore we are dividing. Suppose one animal is born in India or in America. We don't take him as "my brother. He is also born in the same national." No. He kills it. He gives protection only to the animal with hands and legs, not to the animals who are four-legged. Because he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, therefore his knowledge is imperfect. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitaḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are fighting between the different religions because there is no Kṛṣṇa religion, no eternal religion, temporary religion. "I am Christian," "I am Hindu ," "I am Muslim." Therefore, to solve all the problems the Kṛṣṇa consciousness: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Take to Kṛṣṇa; everything will be solved. So they are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> but they do not know this. Therefore we have to preach. For thirteen years they are attending this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> class or Gītā Bhavan, but nobody knows that this is the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> this is the fact. Why? (Hindi) You tell me. So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is</span> we are presenting, as it is. Then it will be nice. If you understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā as it is,</span> then you'll be profited. If you make your irrelevant commentaries, that "Kṛṣṇa means this, and Pāṇḍava means this, and the Kurukṣetra means another thing, another thing," volumes of books and years together lecturing, what is benefit? You do not know the principles. Simply waste of time. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>notpādayed ratiṁ yadi<br class="calibre2"/>śrama eva hi kevalam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If anyone is serving the cause of his religion very perfectly, very nicely, so-called nicely, but after serving or observing the rules and regulation, one's religious principles, if he does not understand what is God and relationship with Him and does not become attracted to Kṛṣṇa, or God, then all, whatever he has done, it is simply waste of time. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice and so important. <span class="Italic">Aiye Aiye.</span> You can make some place here. Make. Oh, you have to go. Now available. Available. (?) Yes, we are ready. Come. By who? He did not know? Then where...? (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have heard about our philosophy? You have heard about our philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Whatever I have read, but, you see, I don't believe what I have read. I believe only whatever I have talked to you, whatever you have said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is another thing. But still, what is your conception of our philosophy? What is that teaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Whose? My?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, as we are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I have understood what I have heard from you, what is your conception of God, I have not understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our conception of God is that He is a transcendental person. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. Īśvara</span> means Lord. The Supreme Lord is a person. As you are person, He is also person, but He is the chief person. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ.</span> He is the leader, and we are all led. Or He is the master; we are the servitors. That is our self-realization, to understand that "I am eternal servant of God." In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ:</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7] "Eternally all the living entities are My part and parcels." So as the part and parcel of anything is to serve the cause of the whole, similarly, all living entities, their only business is to serve the Supreme. That is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, I have understood that the...(indistinct)... if <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is written afterwards by Sanjaya, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then just to prove... (indistinct) According to me, when Lord Kṛṣṇa... (indistinct) When the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> goes into the trance, the mind goes into the trance, and into the <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva,</span> then he gets the vision of all, past, future, and present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First thing that you said, that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was given in seven verses, and later on, Vyāsadeva has expanded. Now, suppose accepting that Vyāsadeva has expanded, do you find any difference between Vyāsadeva's explanation and the original seven verses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. Of course, that is... (unintelligible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, accepting even that Vyāsadeva has expanded, so there is no difference. Therefore, even if we take the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is presented by Vyāsadeva, so there is nothing to be said against it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he gave us only eight verses, <span class="Italic">Śikṣāṣṭaka.</span> But our Gosvāmīs, they have written volumes of books on that eight verses. But there is no difference of the writings of the Gosvāmīs and the original eight verses. That is not very important thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One more, sir. Lord Kṛṣṇa has never asked Arjuna to sit and do <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span> He said, <span class="Italic">uttiṣṭha mām anusmara yuddhya: [</span>Bg. 8.7<span class="Italic">]</span> "Get up and fight! And fight! And fight! That fight, that is your right." I'll fight. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So fight with whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> "Fight with your enemy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is your enemy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Even physical, bodily, whatever it is, whatever it is, but you must know who your enemies are. Your enemy may be my friend. (part indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice proposal. Unless you find an enemy, how you can fight? So of course, we do not say... We Vaiṣṇavas do not say that there is no need of fighting. We never say. When there is need of fighting we must fight. Rather, somebody in New York, some Goldsmith, he was that, "Why Kṛṣṇa is advising Arjuna to fight, to become violent?" So somebody protests like that. But there is no meaning of protesting against the action of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is our view. So we Vaiṣṇavas, we are chanting. It does not mean that when there is need of fighting with <span class="Italic">avaiṣṇava</span> we shall lack in strength. We can fight. One gentleman inquired from me that "Vaiṣṇavism makes one dull. He cannot act." And, "No. You have not seen a Vaiṣṇava." In the two fightings, great fighting, the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> the hero was Hanuman and Arjuna, and they fought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They fought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And who can be better Vaiṣṇava than them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Vaiṣṇava does not mean he is dull. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that is well proved. If there is need...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our present fighting is atheism, against atheism. They say, "There is no God. God is dead. I am God. You are God." We are fighting against these principles. So our fighting is very strong. You don't think that we are keeping idly. I have come here to fight with these atheists, you see, and we go everywhere. We are fighting with atheists all over the world. So we are meeting so many opposing elements. You see? They say, "God is dead." In America, when I first went, they were popularizing theory that "God is dead." But they again accepted and:  God is not dead, but He is here with Swamiji." They accepted. So these atheistic theories, that "Everyone is God," "I am God," "you are God," "God is dead," "there is no God," "God is not person"-we are fighting against these principles. We say, "God is Kṛṣṇa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa. He is a person, and He is not dead." This is our preaching. Therefore it is a fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He is not dead. He is not dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How He can be dead? How you can think of like that, that God is dead? That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If you say God is dead, that means you are... that is your own ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are fighting against this ignorance, so many ignorance. And at the present moment so many theories and religious principles have sprung up unnecessarily. You see? But we are sticking to the principle that the only religion is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is real religion: surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Complete surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Complete surrender. That is real religion. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityjya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja. Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are Kṛṣṇa's words. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">. Prapadyate</span>-that is surrender. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> These words are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I like only the last <span class="Italic">ślokas...</span> (indistinct)... where Lord Kṛṣṇa analyzes and... (indistinct) ...but to bring your mind and <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> together that process is called yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you know that Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā: [Bg. </span>6.47] "Of all the yogis, one who is always thinking of Me within his mind, he is first-class." Do you accept this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Of all the <span class="Italic">yoginām?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ:</span> "Of all the yogis..." <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ.</span> That is the last verse of the yoga chapter, <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga</span> chapter. <span class="Italic">Yoginām...</span> When Arjuna said that "This practice of <span class="Italic">aṣṭāṅga-yoga</span> is not possible for me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, of course not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he said. When he said like that, so Kṛṣṇa answered, "Yes, practice. If you practice, it can be possible. But still, anyone..." He summarized the whole yoga process, <span class="Italic">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ:</span> "Of all yogis, anyone who is thinking of Me always, he is the first-class yogi."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you say <span class="Italic">karma-yoga?</span> Where you get this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> "Whatever you do." "Whatever you do." It is not written that you should do the <span class="Italic">aṣṭāṅga-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. We are discussing this verse. He said that "Anyone who is always think..." <span class="Italic">Karma-yogi</span> also always thinks of Kṛṣṇa. That's all right. That is not denied. But the highest principle is always keeping Kṛṣṇa within his mind. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita...</span> That is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā.</span> <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> This kind of practice of yoga can be done by an unalloyed devotee. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita,</span> by developing the dormant love of God. That is... That is the highest perfection. And another thing is, you are accepting mind as <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> are you not? That's not correct. Mind is not <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, mind is not <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> No. The <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> and mind, they come together, each other come. When your mind does not go from here to there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, mind fixed up in <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> That's nice. But mind is not <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind is matter, subtle matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Certainly. That is the laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind is kind of fume of the <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> So mind becomes, changes the color of the fume according to the state of the <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> If the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is in pure state, then mind is pure. If the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is impure state, the mind is impure. So we have taught all our disciples, <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">,</span> always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto yo māṁ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">. Dṛḍha-vratāḥ:</span> "One who is always chanting about Me and endeavoring with great determination to reach Me, he is <span class="Italic">mahātmā."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> As you have said, <span class="Italic">nāhaṁ tiṣṭhāmi vaikuṇṭhe yogināṁ hṛdayeṣu vā mad-bhakteṣ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tiṣṭhāmi.</span> That's it. Therefore a devotee's position is sublime. Kṛṣṇa comes as a devotee also. Actually this happened. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he happened to be a Mohammedan, Lord Caitanya's devotee. So in those days, five hundred years ago, there was some Hindu-Muslim... Still that is going on. So he did not enter Jagannātha temple to create some disturbance. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also did not ask him that "You go to Jagannātha temple. Who can check you?" Of course, if Caitanya Mahāprabhu had ordered, he would have gone. Neither he wanted to go, neither Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "You must go." Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to come to him. <span class="Italic">Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ.</span> This is the practical. He came to the devotee where he was chanting. So instead of approaching God, if you chant, God will approach you. That is a fact, we see. Instead of Haridāsa Ṭhākura going to Jagannātha, Jagannātha Himself was coming to him. Every day Lord Caitanya would come and ask and sit down, "How you are feeling? What you are doing?" Then He would go to take bath in <span class="Italic">Samudra.</span> Daily. It was Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... And when Haridāsa Ṭhākura expired, He personally took the body and cremated on the bank of the <span class="Italic">Samudra</span> and he performed the funeral ceremony. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was so... And he was given the title <span class="Italic">nāmācārya,</span> "authority of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra."</span> Very nice that you are cultivating this knowledge. It is very nice. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> This cultivation of spiritual knowledge means perfection of life. But people do not try for it. Therefore <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu:</span> "Out of many thousands of men, one may try to cultivate knowledge for spiritual advancement." And <span class="Italic">yatatām api siddhānāṁ: [Bg. 7.3]</span> "Out of many such persons who are cultivating spiritual knowledge, hardly one can understand what is Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Very correct. To understand Him is a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is liberation. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyam yo janati tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> To understand Kṛṣṇa... Nobody can understand Kṛṣṇa, but still, to such an extent, if one can understand Him, then he immediately becomes liberated. Immediately. And not to speak of developing his love of Kṛṣṇa, simply by knowledge, by real knowledge, if one understands Kṛṣṇa, that is sufficient to make him liberated. And those who are devotees, for them liberation is very insignificant. <span class="Italic">Muktir mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate 'sman.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> On the first day of this inauguration, and there were definitions about <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, the governor. (laughter) Just see. He is speaking of <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> Slaughtering ten thousand cows, that is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> This nonsense speaking of <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So actually I shall present...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The governor became little perturbed. He wanted to go immediately. You were present? And when the other men began to speak all hodgepodge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I like your one sentence that day. Whatever is according to the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> that is correct. I agree to it. Nobody says that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Karma done does not mean that you manufacture something and it becomes a <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is written, whatever, in <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was just going to explain all this <span class="Italic">karma, vikarma, akarma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What does he know? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, the land of sages, land of Kṛṣṇa, land of Lord Rāmacandra, land of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, without any restriction cow slaughter is going on. And they are speaking of <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> Just see the fun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I don't know where this India is going to, the land of Kṛṣṇa is going to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well... No, we should try our best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have to fight these habits. It is our duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's it. So you are a military man. I request you to fight against this nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swami, I wish you could come sometime. I will gather section of some people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I'll go. I'll go. Where? Just fix up some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because I am very near to temple, only 100 yards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That Takat? (?) Takat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, not Takat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I see, oh. We are thinking of having a branch near that Takat, in that Takat colony. What is your idea? Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness center. Is that a good locality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I'll tell you. I'll fight Tukori(?). (indistinct)...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever arrangement you do, that's all right. But if some of you members become our life members, that will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Have you seen our books? Would you like to see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can explain. [break] ...the footprints of liberated predecessors like Manu and others. So they are conditioned. Therefore their rules and regulations are not perfect. It cannot be perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Here is our monthly magazine, <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> These are our... (indistinct) This is in Washington, D.C. This is in Berkeley, California. That magazine is being printed in six languages: Hindi, English, French, German, and Japanese, and Bengali. Bengali is not yet out, but it's coming. Then Prabhupāda started presenting these books while he was still in India. This book was published in 1965. This was printed in India, the First Canto of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The First Canto comprises three volumes like this, the First Canto. And then the following Cantos are being printed by our own press in America in Boston, like this, chapter by chapter, so that people can take advantage of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and read it at their convenience instead of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And here, Kṛṣṇa Book, is the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Prabhupāda calls it, <span class="Italic">"Kṛṣṇa: The Supreme Personality of Godhead." </span>And it's full of illustrations which are done by his American students. Just see how beautiful. There are eighty-four full color illustrations that show the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa. So the people in the western world and for the first time in the history of the world will get an idea of who God is, what He looks like, what He does, where He's residing. This is the Kṛṣṇa Book, in two volumes. This is volume number one and this is volume number two. This is just a blueprint. We haven't got a printed copy yet. Then <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> which you must be familiar with, in the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</span> and there are also illustrations although they're not color. They're black and white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Śrī Tukārāma is disciple of Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He also went through in Maharastra by His chanting, (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And most important, Prabhupāda has presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He calls it <span class="Italic">"Bhagavad-gītā As It Is." </span>He explains in the introduction that till now there's been so many <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gitas</span> printed in all languages and all of them are misrepresenting. They have not presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. They are trying to present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> without Kṛṣṇa. They want to leave out the speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and put themselves forward. So Prabhupāda has presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is</span> and therefore this movement has taken such hold because the real thing is being presented. This is in San Francisco, California. Then, the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion,</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī's book <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,</span> also there. This book is the lawbook of devotional service. <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad,</span> word for word translation, then the complete English translation and purport by His Divine Grace. So these books are (indistinct) <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa consciousness (indistinct) explaining the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> So we have so much literature. And in India we've introduced a program, our membership program, so that we can go on distributing these literatures. And that membership program, there are four types of membership. One is life membership. Life membership means the member is entitled to all the books that we have printed plus all the books we will print in the future, plus a lifetime subscription to our magazine, <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> And the member is entitled to stay at any one of our branches throughout the world free and if he happens to travel abroad or in India. We will have our branches. So that life membership fee is 1,111 rupees. And then we have donor membership. The donor member is entitled to all the books that have been printed, a lifetime subscription to our magazine, but he does not get the books in the future. That is 555 rupees. And subscriber membership, lifetime subscription to our magazine, which is 222 rupees. Or there is membership, yearly subscription to our magazine. In this way we're trying to recruit members that support our movement. This movement is being supported just by literature. So in this way we can flood the whole world with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then there'll be a change. If we want to see a change in the world, then we have to distribute knowledge of Kṛṣṇa in this way. You are welcome to become a member. And also your friends. Tell them about our membership programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, open a center here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I wish to. I wish to open a center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And how many centers in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practically, three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swami, did you come across these Brahma-kumaris? They preach something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is something else. Everyone knows it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Once they... I was in ... So they were passing through, teaching some Kṛṣṇa or something, and their <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> was something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on. [break] There may be musical performance but here it is by the pure devotees. That is different thing. Now, here don't you see in the Gītā Bhavan? When others perform <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> nobody takes part. And they cannot continue that <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> more than five minutes. But we can continue our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> for five hours without any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If we stayed there for five hours everyone would chant. (indistinct conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, <span class="Italic">mahāmantra</span> they can also do, but it will not be effective because they are not pure. Here is the secret. We have... Our devotees, they are <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> they have no other business than to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. They perform <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> to take something from Kṛṣṇa. Everyone goes to some <span class="Italic">dharma-saṁsthāna</span> just to take something. But our proposition is to give everything for Kṛṣṇa and that is far different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everyone is pleased with the devotees, everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That when you do, I shall tell you. Now why do you waste your time in that way? That's all right, you are not doing so you have no business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct) Of course, I am not doing... (indistinct, several people talking at once.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) This is called <span class="Italic">vṛddha.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">yoni.</span> This is <span class="Italic">madhyama.</span> This is <span class="Italic">anāvṛtta,</span> and this is <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha.</span> (indistinct conversation) Stores are now closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So he has gone to Calcutta. [break] <span class="Italic">Utsāhan, dhairyāt.</span> Are you realizing the distinction between this association and others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you should realize. That is realization. We are trying to create a real spiritual path, not bogus, for livelihood. India's falldown is due to that spirit, that everyone takes everything for livelihood, that's all. Not only India, everywhere. India especially because poverty-stricken. So they take religion also as livelihood. Just like this Akhila Saheb. He wanted to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> for livelihood. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How? How it was? No, you do not know. He was proposing that "I know how to cure disease by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa." So he wanted to go to foreign countries to take this profession. That means an attempt to kill our movement in purity. Of course, nobody can kill our movement, but this sort of thinking is just against the purity of our movement: utilize Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> for curing disease. Oh, it will not stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No. If we put it on the window it will stay. It won't stay on the wall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If he puts it on the window it will stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Window means it will be dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. I think that (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It has to be done. Not only idea, it has to be done in practical sense. Now who will take charge of this task? That is to be found out. You write to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> GBC?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (unintelligible) So many newspapers have come out within the last three or four years. Of course, most of them are hippie groups, but they have become... People are very anxious to read something from different angle of vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They are tired of old newspapers. So if we present a newspaper with our angle of vision, Kṛṣṇa consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So immediately you write to the GBC members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But the articles that will be in the newspaper, they will be exactly like other newspapers? Who will write them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, articles... Daily newspaper means there must be news. News you can purchase from the news collecting company. They will supply it. At very cheap price they'll supply. And you take advertisement. Yes. You'll cover your expenses by getting advertisements and make sufficient profit. Newspaper starting is not a losing business provided you can organize. Just like ordinary newspaper, they give... In daily news... People want to learn daily news, and they supply huge quantity. And those who are advertiser, they are simply concerned how many copies are issued. If you issue 100,000's of copies, then you can charge for each page thousand dollars. They will pay. Two thousand dollars they will pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That means in each city we would we have to have our own local press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not necessarily. You can arrange with any newspaper place. You simply supply your matter; they will print. Just like we are getting from Japan, similarly, make your own layout and supply them. Immediately, within two hours, everything is complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But a daily newspaper has to turn out daily, so it takes time to transport it from one city to another city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, from every city we can publish. Every city there is a newspaper place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> ...national, just like the national...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we have to organize. First of all let us publish in one city, big city like New York, like London, yes, Bombay, Tokyo. Big cities, world's big cities. In India only two cities are big: Calcutta, and Bombay, important. If you publish simultaneously, Calcutta... Delhi is given importance due to capital; otherwise not important as big city, as Bombay and Calcutta. Delhi, without government offices it is a dead city. Just like Washington. What is the value of Washington? It is nothing. Simply because it is headquarters of the President, it has got importance. Similarly, Delhi is that. Otherwise it is not important. But Calcutta, Bombay, is really important city in India, big business, port, all rich men, every kind of, all cultural, everything-Calcutta, and Bombay. Originally only Calcutta, now Bombay also. Because the Britishers, they made Calcutta capital. And Calcutta was very, very important city. But these Calcutta men, they create sometimes situation, very complicated. So once in 1905 the same situation was there, politically. Sir Surendranath Bannerjee made, Surendranath Bannerjee's movement, partition of Bengal. Lord Collier, he wanted to divide Bengal, made it East Bengal and West Bengal. And Surendranath Bannerjee... He is the practically father of Indian politics. Gandhi's not. He was. He was. And in the beginning, in European circles he was famous. He was called "Surrender-not." The spelling of the name, s-u-r-e-n-d-e-r, Surendranath. In Parliament he was known as "Surrender-not." He was a very powerful politician. So there was trouble in Calcutta; so therefore they transferred, 1911, capital to Delhi. Otherwise, from the very beginning of British occupation Calcutta was the capital. You have seen the government viceroy's house near that Hamilton building where you were trying to purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The government house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. It is better than Buckingham Palace, such a big house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, the governor's house. The governor's house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, governor's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's surrounded just like a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A big garden. Yes. That was viceroy's house. Now it is dilapidated. Otherwise, formerly it was very, very nice. Huge palace in India. Lord Collier's policy was to bring one of the princes from England and make him king of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> King of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That was his policy. He favored that policy, that Indian people are in favor of monarchy. So introduce this system: one of the royal family's son should come and become king of India. That was good suggestion. If Britishers would have ruled India for the interest of India, making one king from the royal family, it would have been great success. That policy of Lord Collier was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That never happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing. The parliamentary members... Just like nowadays, party. India is suffering in party politics. And they did not like to give importance to monarchy. They wanted to rule according to their whims, and therefore the whole scheme failed. The so-called democracy under party politics is nonsense. Monarchy... I have said. That day I was in remarking that "This democracy is the government of the asses," because the population are asses and they vote another ass to be head of the government. So what you can do? <span class="Italic">Sayuddhe kriyate rājan sa kim asnu pahanam.</span> These are instructions in Sanskrit. "If you make a dog a king, don't you think that he will still lap the shoes?" You cannot change his habits. <span class="Italic">Sva... Yasya bhāvasya na sa sudurate kramaḥ.</span> Anyone's habits, even if you give good position, you cannot change it. The example is just like if you make a dog the king, he will immediately come from the throne and bite the shoes. You see? So materially you cannot change. Only by spiritual understanding one can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Canakya Pandit... I have see that book, and he says in his book that if a crow sits on a high (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you make a crow... The crow generally sits on the roof of the house, but that does not mean he has become a great man. "How great I am, a very beautiful bird."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The symbol of the Democrat party in America is the ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. As soon as you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Their symbol is an ass. They have a symbol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Because they are asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The Republican party is elephant and the Democratic party is ass, a donkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the value of vote by asses? According to Vedic civilization, there was democracy but that democracy is selected committee. Just like in England there was Privy Council. So selected body of learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and sages, they were guiding the king, and the king himself was properly educated how to rule over, under religious principles. He was trained from the beginning of his life as prince. As the future heir of the throne, he was trained, and at the same time, he was guided by a council of learned sages and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> They were looking over the activities of the king. As soon as there was some mistake they will see. And there are instances; whenever there was a bad king they were dethroned. Not for political purpose. He was dethroned but his son was on the... Just like Lord Rāmacandra did. Rāmacandra killed Rāvaṇa but He never occupied the kingdom. His brother Vibhīṣaṇa proved to be faithful. He was enthroned. From the same family. And that was the system. Even a king was wrong, he would be dethroned but from his family, either his son or brother, or somebody would occupy there. Not that "Because I have conquered you, therefore I shall sit down." No. There are many instances. And therefore India was ruling all over the world. The emperor was in India, and the kings of different states, their family was. So there was no rebellion. And in every state a king was trained in the same process, guided by committee of learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and sages. How perfect this monarchy is. Monarchy... That Lord Collier studied that the Indian people like monarchy. Even these states, the so-called states... Now the Congress government has killed them; otherwise the Britishers were maintaining, necessary, and they were developed. Now see. The Indore was far better before. You can see from the buildings, from the whole city. It was very prosperous city. Still it is going on. So every state, the native prince, the Britishers maintained so many native prince. And because they maintained them, they were friends to the Britishers. They knew the policy, if you create <span class="Italic">zamindar,</span> landlord. They created this aristocratic class to support them. So when Gandhi and other leaders started this movement all the princes and <span class="Italic">zamindars,</span> they were in favor of British. Therefore it took so much time to transfer. And as a retaliation, the common people have bereft them of their kingdom. "No more kingdom because you always supported Britishers." It is a great politics. Therfore they have taken... The <span class="Italic">zamindars,</span> immediately after this attainment of independence, all the <span class="Italic">zamindars</span> and kings were bereft of their possessions. You were in Calcutta? Oh, none of you were with me. We saw one house for purchasing. That was a big <span class="Italic">zamindar's</span> house, Tagore Thakur(?) You saw? Yes. If you have saw... How nicely it was. When they were in opulence in our childhood, oh, it was a house to be seen. There are many houses. Just like in England the lord families. In Ascot, where we stayed, that was also lord family's house. Now Yoko's house, a third-class Japanese girl. She has become the queen of the house. And how third-class, low-grade. It is the sitting room and a naked picture has... How much degraded people have become. How this man is daring to hang that picture in his sitting room so that everyone who comes sees. How much low-graded they are. They want change, but because they have no (indistinct) education they are going to the animal sphere. That is hippie movement. Yes. From animal standard they become civilized. The same story, <span class="Italic">punar muṣika bhāvaḥ.</span> You know that story? "Again become mouse."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh yeah, I've heard that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The story is a mouse came to a saintly person: "Sir, I am in trouble. If you kindly release me?" "What is that trouble?" "A cat, they are after me. I am always at risk of life." "So what do you want?" "You also make me a cat." "All right. You become a cat." Then again he came. "Sir, again the complaint is here." "What is that?" "Dogs are chasing me." "Then what do you want?" "I want to become a dog." "All right. You become a dog." In this way he came up to the tiger by the benediction of the... And when he became a tiger, he was... (snarling sound-laughter) Just like our Brahmānanda Prabhu. "All right. Again become mouse." You see? So these civilization is like that. They became tiger, and they are so much badly trained up that they have to become again a mouse. That is the way. That is the way of nature. If you don't improve yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you again become stool worms. The human form of life is an opportunity to come out of the cycle of birth and death, but if one does not take-these are the statements in <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa</span>-then he loses the chance. They do not know what is life, how life is rotating, talking nonsense, "I am God. Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? This is written by man." How much low-graded people have become. They are completely under the laws of nature. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">,</span> stringent laws of nature, and still, they are claiming, "I am God. I am this. I am that. I am free. I am..." And they do not mind, even they are degraded to the position of the worm of stool. But there is possibility. What is this worm of stool? It is also living entity. It is not a different thing. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who knows, he knows that the worm of stool and Brahmā are the same living entity. Simply under different reaction of <span class="Italic">karma</span> one has become Brahmā and another has become the stool worm. Now we begin. [break] It is not difficult. Simply the layout should be sent to different parts, and they will make immediately plate, and that will be paper. Daily you have to send it. Eh?</div>

We have published so many books, they are not even able to read these books. So the other devotees, (laughs) they cannot ri..., come at five o'clock. That is the test. Yes.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> It might be difficult to make arrangements, Guru Mahārāja. The place where Gurudāsa is presently staying is not equipped for ten people at present. We'll have to arrange.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Yes. We were invited to stay there for ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that's all right. So, who invited?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> One of the people connected with the temple has associated with us in Delhi and (indistinct) has invited us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So first of all take information from the Pujari(?) in which train they have booked our seats for Delhi, and you write immediately one letter to Dhruva in Bombay and Tamal Kṛṣṇa also, that Dhruva may instruct the Delhi Birla's <span class="Italic">dharmaśāla</span> to accommodate us immediately.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So the residential place belongs to Mrs. Birla?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Parliament is in session now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> No. Out of session now. When it's in session then all of the politicians come from their castles and (indistinct) their most of the members of Parliament (indistinct)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Giriraja:</span> Insofar as seeing the prime minister, this is the best time because he is not so preoccupied.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Maybe ten minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So she took some interest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> She took a courteous interest. As I say, there was no doubt that at the time that she saw him she was pressed with other matters. A very personal friend of hers that Gurudāsa is now staying with told us that she was very impressed, her personal secretary was very impressed, and that she said-we have it on tape-that she would like to see us again and she was sorry that she didn't realize that we had been waiting for so long. Otherwise we could have come earlier, she would have (indistinct) In that way (indistinct) some time in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> In (indistinct) we saw some yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pressing nose. Nose-pressing philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Haṭha-yoga also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what was his philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> You do some exercises and know God, be self-realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should have said to him, "Are you self-realized?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> I'm such a rascal, I didn't even try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they tell you then he's God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> (indistinct) exercise and breathing (indistinct) some type of meditation performed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> He's social swami, a very social swami. He's very polished in a material way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees (5):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And smoking also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> I didn't inquire into his vices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> In New York they call them "uptown swamis."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> His example of spiritual life is based on material prosperity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they should go to the yoga system? The science is more advanced. Before flying in the sky by a yogi he has to press his nose for so many years and the science has given us the airplane. He can purchase ticket, immediately fly. (laughter) What is use of pressing nose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> You explain that in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is the use, wasting time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> (indistinct) about when you walk on the water, walking on the water is a bogus thing (indistinct) two cent yogi because for two cents he could have taken (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. If that is the ultimate end of life, to walk on the water or to fly in the sky, so science has given them all opportunity. And the material science is so advanced, that all this yoga system is now almost accomplished because that is material only, material prosperity. <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, eating flesh sumptuously and get fat. Flesh-eaters get fatty very quickly, flesh-eaters. <span class="Italic">Māṁsa.</span> The skin becomes increased for flesh-eating. You see in your country, the Russia? Russian beauty-big belly, fat. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Germans are like that too. Germans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Germans. If you eat meat, you very quickly can get fat. Also too much ghee also. That is also. But ghee will increase your belly only. Just the <span class="Italic">Marwaris...</span> (laughter) But by eating flesh you'll get sturdy, good lump of muscles. That is... In <span class="Italic">Āyur-Veda</span> there is a chapter which is called <span class="Italic">Dravya-guṇa.</span> There is a book, <span class="Italic">Dravya-guṇa.</span> So they have analyzed so many different kinds of flesh-birds, beasts, animals. How they have analyzed? That "If you eat this kind flesh you will get this kind of result." Hundreds of fleshes. What do they know? They can eat only cow's flesh or dog's flesh or hog's flesh. Yes. But there are so many, even birds, beasts, animals, and so many, analysis. And Bernard Shaw, I think, he wrote one book, "You Are What You Eat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> George Bernard Shaw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they are becoming animals, animals eating animal flesh. Bernard Shaw was vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Except he would take liver for his health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Liver?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Yes. He used to take some liver periodically for his health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Medicine. There are many liver extract preparations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> No, not liver extract. Maybe. I don't know exactly. But I know he used to take liver. Not cod liver oil or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, liver extract preparations there are many medicines. For anemic patient liver extract is recommended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> That's all right for us to take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but if you are going to die, then you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When required for such trouble, if you are going to die, then, to save yourself, you can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> If that liver can be eaten raw...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are going to die. Not ordinary. If it is clear that without liver extract you shall die, you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> You cannot tell. You can't tell until you actually (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because when there is question of death it is recommended you may take anything to save your life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But those who are rigid, they are prepared to die even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Vaiṣṇavas, wouldn't they just chant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their proposal is "Death is sure today or tomorrow, so why shall I change my principles? Death will take place even if I live for ten years more, and what is the benefit? Why shall I change my principles? It is not that by taking that medicine or liver extract I shall be <span class="Italic">amara,</span> immortal." That is not possible. If somebody gives some medicine that one can make himself immortal, that is another thing. Nobody is going to be immortal. Why he should be afraid of death? Death will take place. "As sure as death." So today, or tomorrow, or hundred years after. So if one moment is utilized for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that makes life successful. Why shall I live for hundred years, waste my time? One moment is sufficient for living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I just have one question about the ending, that Ajāmila, he was calling the name of his youngest son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> He was thinking but he was calling out to him, and after calling, he was reminded of his early life, of his worshiping the real Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> And therefore Nārāyaṇa saved him. Isn't that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Not that he was simply calling and Nārāyaṇa had to save him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But simply calling, "Nārāyaṇa," he reminded, he remembered. Remembered. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> He remembered the real Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because actually when one chants Lord Kṛṣṇa's name, Lord's name, immediately he remembers Lord's form, activities, pastimes, everything. That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Not that he was unconsciously just chanting and the Lord saved him in that way, but he actually remembered the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the remark of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. But according to others' opinion, even simply by chanting, that is sufficient. In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is stated like that. But Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has remarked that this chanting referred to the context. Immediately he remembered Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> In that same connection, the story of Ṭhākura Haridāsa and the harlot. She began to chant and told him the reason that she was a prostitute, she was no good and simply by that association she began to chant or by previous association...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, by association. By the influence of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. For three days, three days she associated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> But Professor Sanyal was putting forward his theory that in previous lives she had had association; therefore she began to chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why previous lives? That's not very good reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Subconscious, that she had subconsciously remembered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no. That is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> In one of the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazines</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not. He advocates that.(?) Direct association with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Why previously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> We want to say that previously she had done some chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't find any such thing. Professor Sanyal was not very much advanced. He committed so many blunders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> You heard about that article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> That was the (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if that sort of remark is given it is not against the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> but it was not necessarily previously. His direct association... Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,</div>
<div class="Verse">sādhu saṅga sādhu saṅga sarva śāstra kaya<br class="calibre2"/>lava mātra sādhu saṅge sarva siddhi haya<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Even a moment's association with a pure devotee-all success." Not necessarily that one has to acquire it previous, no. Generally it is so, but <span class="Italic">sādhu sanga</span> has got its effect. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">lavamatra sādhu sanga sarva siddhi haya.</span> You have not read in the <span class="Italic">Sanātana-śikṣā</span> in the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Does that also apply to reading the words of a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Even a little association with your books has the same effect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Effect, of course, it requires both the things. One must be very eager to take it. Just like Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and there are so many others. They are also reading <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So Mahārāja Parīkṣit was very serious. So both things should be serious. Just like the example: the husband and wife must be potent; then there is pregnancy. Otherwise there is no pregnancy. So sewing the seed, the field also must be fertile or receptive, then the seed will fructify. It is reciprocal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If the seed starts to sprout and it lacks sufficient facilities, then it will die completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But if a spiritual seed sprouts, then whatever sprout is made is never lost. Right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not lost, but it is checked. Sometimes he is checked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Because the tendency to revive again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In that way again one has to... That brings the question of previous life. One was advanced so much; it was checked by some reason; he again begins from that point. Just like Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura was advanced in his previous life up to <span class="Italic">bhava-bhakti.</span> Somehow or other, it was checked. But as soon as he heard the words from the prostitute, "Oh, you are so much after the flesh and similar, and bones and skin. If you had been so much eager for Kṛṣṇa, how you would have been disposed," immediately he came to that point and immediately left. I'll take (devotees offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? The other day you talked about the spirit soul and his position in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> that there's no shelter there. Just like we go up, up, up into the sky (indistinct) there's no shelter there so you have to go to some planet. So I was thinking that the reason why our position is shaky is due to this body, but spirit, being restless can remain anywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but there the shelter is transcendental bliss. The impersonal Brahman is not transcendental bliss. It is simply eternity. But we want three things: eternity, full knowledge, and blissful life. So there is no bliss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Yes. Just as we require shelter because we have the body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So similarly, this living entity also requires shelter of blissful life. That is this association of Kṛṣṇa. So unless he gets that, he wants blissfulness, but-there is some spiritual blissfulness; he has no information-he comes down again to this perverted blissfulness of this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> They don't take their pleasure in being there in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no pleasure. Blissfulness is not there, <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is simply eternity, that's all. The same example can be given. Just like sunlight. There is only light. But on a planet the effect of the light is there-there are so many trees, so many flowers, fruits. We, we want varieties of pleasure. Variety is the mother of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">devotees:</span> "Variety is the spice of life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Spice of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Yes. So therefore, we are living entities, life. We want variety. So this is the varietyless, no variety, one kind, sunlight. We require sunlight. We are so much anxious for sunlight. Not only sunlight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It must get very boring. It is very boring in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span>? You get very bored? There is nothing to do? Nowhere to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Boring, dull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> But at first they are satisfied, aren't they, that they've achieved their goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know. They are after <span class="Italic">brahmaṇanda,</span> transcendental pleasure, but they do not know what is actually transcendental pleasure, impersonalists. Therefore their intelligence is not clean. They go to the spiritual kingdom, transcendental platform, but they do not that know, how real transcendental pleasure can be achieved. Therefore their knowledge is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> When they want to come back, is it very easy for them to come back or have they got to...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they automatically come back because he is hankering after varieties. So that variety is not there, so he is attracted again in the material world. Just like so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> Take Vivekananda. He wanted to lecture on Vedānta, which is liberation. He came again back to the hospitalizing and philanthropic work because he could not find the variety of pleasure in Vedānta. Of course, he was not very much advanced. There are many. There is a... <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī</span> is here. he's a <span class="Italic">Kārpātrī</span>(?). He is very learned and other... He was formerly speaking on Vedānta and other... Now he is in politics and cow protection. You see? There are many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I have a hazy memory that one time I heard that when a soul, when it finally does enter into <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> that he has to remain there for some long duration of time, a daytime of Brahmā or a lifetime of Brahmā. Is that correct? What is that duration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not that. That is not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not like that. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he feels inconvenience without varieties of life. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ:</span> "Their intelligence is not clean." <span class="Italic">Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ: [SB </span>10.2.32] "Although they rise up to the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti," patanty adho tataḥ,</span> "they again come back."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And the <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa</span> conception of life is just before Brahman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa</span> conception is marginal position between <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> and this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Just on the brink.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇārṇava. Kāraṇārṇava.</span> The Kāraṇa Ocean wherefrom the beginning of creation, material creation, that is <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Virajā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Virajā,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Is it possible to go there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Arjuna went there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> What was Arjuna's purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa took him to show His friend. He did not go alone. That he could not. No. (laughter) It was Kṛṣṇa's chariot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So he went to the spiritual sky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then what is the use of making friendship with Kṛṣṇa if you cannot do so? There was a rich man in Calcutta, Motilal Sill. He was so rich that... Every man has different circle in younger days. So he would see. If any of his friends did not possess a house in Calcutta, he would purchase house. He said that, "If people say, 'Oh, you are friend of Motilal Sill. You have no your own house?' what people will say about me? He must have his own house." He purchased house for him. He was very big man. And there are many incidences also like, a very noble story. Actually it was not long ago, say about hundred years ago. He would not see that any one of his associates, friends, does not possess a house in Calcutta. Another Kṛṣṇa's friend, Sudama also. (chuckles) He could not recognize his own place, how it had happened, palatial buildings, garden. In <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa,</span> you have not read Sudama? Give me water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> (indistinct) mentions in the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</span> that a devotee in attachment selects one of the Vṛndāvana..., the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, and follows in his footsteps in order to be successful in his own devotional service. Does that mean that one of our spiritual masters is an eternal representative of Vṛndāvana? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? Let me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> It says, "All inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi, Vṛndāvana, are very dear to Kṛṣṇa. A devotee in attachment selects one of the inhabitants and follows in his footsteps in order to be successful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotee... Devoted to the Vṛndāvana inhabitants. You don't directly think of yourself that "I shall see Kṛṣṇa as my son."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> No.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to follow the footsteps of Yasoda Ma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Yes. You've told me that before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it will be success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But you've said that you are always in Vṛndāvana, so we are following a Vṛndāvana inhabitant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> It says, "One should always remember the activities of that particular inhabitant of Vraja."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you have got Kapoor(?) daughter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Have we got an engagement this morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He asked if we have an engagement this morning. 8:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Molpar(?), yes. They'll send car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How far it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's supposed to be just in the neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's all. He was formerly prince.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Of this area?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He had given (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the sign of princely opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He's the son of the man we saw last week? This Mahārāja? It's not his son?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he is also old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I won't be going to that place because I'll be waiting for Mr. Homing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Homing is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. (indistinct) we'll open a bank account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
