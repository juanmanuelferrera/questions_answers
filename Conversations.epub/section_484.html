<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...phoned about, about my going there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> To New Vrindaban?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes, I have told him he is waiting for the date. 'Cause Jayatīrtha, we have not fixed up the flight number yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Haṁsadūta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, Haṁsadūta. Yes. Yes, I spoke to him, we spoke to him yesterday morning. (?) (loud waves drown out voices)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atreya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Atreya Ṛṣi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Atreya Ṛṣi I have not been able to get through to yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Do you have his telephone number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's his business. (very loud waves in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to take visa for Tehran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> [break] ...sanctify the whole world by your footsteps. You are criss-crossing the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Tīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni svāntaḥ-sthena gadābhṛtā.</span> Because a pure devotee carries Kṛṣṇa within his heart, therefore wherever he goes he makes a holy place. It is said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> So not me, but every one of you, if you are pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, then wherever you'll go, that is a holy place. <span class="Italic">Tīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni svāntaḥ...</span> To become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> means that, that he'll be pure devotee, and wherever he will go, he will purify. That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> means. <span class="Italic">Mahad-vicalaṁ nṛnāṁ gṛhināṁ dīna-cetasām. Mahātmās,</span> they'll travel so that the householders, who are cripple-minded and full of sinful activities, they'll go there and make them purified. This is the idea of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> And in the Vedic civilization a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> and a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> has open door. There is no restriction. No "Beware of dog." (laughter) But now they are prohibited. I have got practical experience. After my <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> when I was touring India, so in Ahmedabad, or Baroda, I was entering one man's house. So he was standing on the balcony. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Saying "Don't come"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Don't come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The age of Kali is perpetrating itself. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not their fault. Because in India a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> has become a professional beggar. Just change the dress and you can easily eat without any working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> And smoke beedies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything they do. In our childhood we had a house for rental. There was a man. He was a professional beggar. You see? So other members of the house, they'll go to their office. He'll dress himself just like a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and go for begging. (laughter) That was his business. (pause) Here in your country there is no such opportunity, but in India there is good opportunity. If you make a dress of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> you can go anywhere, and you'll be respectable. They'll give you for eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Especially they prey on the women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> In Delhi I went to one minister's house to get some papers. I could see in the back of the house the lady was entertaining some <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> with sweetmeats and drinks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Our men have to change their dress before they go out, <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> That's the only way they can beg in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? We, because of our fallen condition, do require many mechanical means by which we can offer one another respects and to teach one another examples of scripture. For example, we are asked to bow our bodies down to show respects, or to call one another <span class="Italic">"prabhu,</span>" to understand that each person is a spiritual master to the other. How is a... How are the boys and girls to learn these things in manners of decorum and manners from the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> for example. How are they to offer respects to their godbrothers. And, uh... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can. You behave like that, others will learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> For example, I have seen many godbrothers offer one another respects, but I very seldom see that in terms of some of our leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So some of you show by practical example, guide them. Then others will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> One person who sees can lead thousands of blind men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. Very good. (pause) [break] ...not for rain, eh? Simply for covering the sun, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> There's no <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> so there's no sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No rain, no sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the Kali-yuga it will be like that. There will be cloud, even thunderbolt and lightning, but there will be no rain. That is stated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> That is very inauspicious. That is not auspicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> you say that this Kali-yuga is compared to the cloudy season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The Kali-yuga is compared to the cloudy season of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The living entities, the living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And only by the appearance of Lord Caitanya with the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> are the clouds cleared away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Just like sometimes there's a break in the clouds. Sometimes in the Kali-yuga there's the break, Lord Caitanya's movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any ship here, it is going? No, it is standing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> There's little flies and bugs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> They're called sand fleas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Sand fleas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They're eating this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Garbage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> This?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Those are the stones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can eat stone and digest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They can eat the sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The sand is made of little stones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not sand, not sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Pebbles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Snails.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Shells. No, birds eat stones too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes. They eat that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, I don't know. They get nutrition from the stones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No. You said they have a special power to digest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Especially these, what is this called? Duck?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Pigeon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, pigeon. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Peacock. Peacock also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They swallow the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Peacock also, they can digest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They can swallow the very hard peas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And they can digest very easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (loud waves) ...I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> According to Vedic culture, is seaweed edible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Seaweed? Is that edible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't find. Why they should eat seaweed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> In Asia, many people eat seaweed. Certain types of plants that grow in the sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America it is very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right, but why man should eat seaweed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> When there are so many nice things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> If vegetables are not available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> They don't have to cultivate seaweed. They just take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They have to go diving with lungs and tanks to collect it rather than plough the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They consider it a delicacy in the restaurants for the macrobiotic people, the young people who are into health foods. It's a health food. It's a delicacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also eaten. (laughter) Yes. This is eaten by the Japanese. They eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They say it contains much iodine, certain minerals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They make some food and it is sold. What is called, that? They make some cakes by soaking in the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Soybean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not soybean. They make some foodstuff. In India also they are making now. When I was in Ahmedabad, guest of one Mr. Patel, his business is to collect this. And he's a chemist also. And prepare some food. And he's got good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> One of the plans for science in the future is the food from the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Food from the ocean is already there-fishes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, not only fishes. They're trying to investigate more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fish is not sufficient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, fish is not enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> They're never satisfied with the foods they take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Investigation is going on about the availability of food in the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Also. They want to recycle the stool. There's one big plan to make a big city, and then the stool is recycled, and sixty percent can be again re-eaten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> I heard that in Russia they're already making butter from stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Because the body doesn't efficiently take all the nutrients.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They can make butter. This market butter is sometimes coming from stool. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We have to get our own cows very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Here too, in this country also, they're making butter from stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> In this country also they're doing that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The... I... No. During wartime the German people did it, at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Now they're making artificial milk also, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva: :</span>They're advertising. "It's just like milk without the sour taste, without the bitter taste."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are propagating that milk is not good for the (indistinct) natural milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Some scientist came to see me in Melbourne. He was speaking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He was saying that milk is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Stool is good, but milk is not good. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That's all right if you're a pig.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stool is good... We see the pigs. They eat stool. They become very fatty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Stout.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They have no brain for understanding Kṛṣṇa. That only comes from milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> To have a good brain for understanding Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not eating so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Some devotees think that if they eat large quantities of milk, the more they eat, the more their brain will become big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is rajasic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Rajasic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Especially for devotee, too much eating is very, very bad. <span class="Italic">Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ [NoI 2].</span> Too much eating is very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They should only take what is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And too much collecting money also. That is also not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> Too much what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Collecting money. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We were discussing that in all the living bodies, we have these innumerable cells, living cells. And in these cells... We were just discussing whether the Paramātmā and the <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> is still there even in the living cells.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is. It is there. So actually our body's a combination of these so many living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atoms, yes. Why not? The every living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair. So many hairs are there. And that is one ten-thousandth part of the top of the hair. Where is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So there is one <span class="Italic">jīvātma</span> who's in control of the body. The others are subservient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jīvātma</span> is everywhere. But you have got your own field. Just like for agricultural purpose you have got a big field, but there are so many millions of microbes and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is your field. Not that when you go out of the field one of them becomes you. No, that is not. That is individuality. When you leave, you leave your field. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So when we leave the field, then the other cells in the body also leave their field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore the germs come out as soon as it is proper time. So these nonsense, they do not know that, that the... Creating life, the ingredients... If they say that material combination makes life, so material combination is there already. Why the, that man is not coming? That is... He's individual, and they are also individual. I have got my field. I am individual. I leave it. But because there are so many other microbes, they will come as me. No, that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, yes, but temporarily, I cannot live without them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I cannot live in my body without them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without them... You cannot live with this material body without so many conditions. And that is also one of the conditions. You cannot live. Any condition, little disturbed... You become diseased; you become disturbed. So therefore it is called conditional life. You simply live here on condition. And spiritual life means no condition. If the condition is favorable, then your senses will act. Otherwise you have got useless senses. If there is light, then you can see. You can become proud of your eyes. "Can you show me God?" And what you can see, rascal? If God gives you light, then you can see. You see under condition. And still, he's very proud of his eyes. "Can you show me God?" This is going on. Rascal, what you can see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Watch out! (ocean water apparently comes up to devotees.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! Ah. Govinda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The water's coming up to touch your lotus feet, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (loud waves) So we are conditioned. And still, we are searching out the truth. What is your truth? You are conditioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So they only end up with a conditioned truth, a relative truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The more you are not conditioned, the more your finding out truth is perfect. But it is not possible for you to become completely unconditioned. That is not possible. That is <span class="Italic">mukta puruṣa,</span> liberated. Therefore we have to take knowledge from the person who is not conditioned. That is perfect knowledge. And one who is conditioned, what is the value of his giving knowledge? So therefore we don't accept any knowledge from the conditioned souls. Conditioned soul is imperfect by the four deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Bhrama, pramadā...</span> He must commit mistake. So what is the value of his knowledge? There is no value. We take knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unconditioned. There is a verse in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata: eṣad īśānām īśasya.</span> That is God. God means He becomes, He comes within this material world, but He's not conditioned. That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> And His representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The whole thing is managed by the law of gravitation, but when Kṛṣṇa lifted the hill, there was no weight. He's not conditioned by the law of gravity. He can lift up. We cannot do because we are conditioned. And when they cannot understand God's inconceivable power, they think it is all mythology. Because he is a rascal, he thinks Kṛṣṇa also rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They try to put Kṛṣṇa within the framework of their own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because Kṛṣṇa is kindly become visible to our eyes, these rascals immediately take Him as one of us. By His kindness He's coming to be visible by us, to listen Him, His instructions, but these <span class="Italic">mūḍhās</span> will take Him as ordinary human being. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So the consciousness, my consciousness... The consciousness of those living cells are dependent on my consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that consciousness is not developed. It is not equal to your consciousness. Just like a child's consciousness is not equal to your consciousness because he's not yet developed, similarly, this human life is the full-fledged... Not full-fledged. Almost full demonstration of consciousness. We have to utilize it for higher understanding. From material conditions, the consciousness develops. On account of loss of consciousness, they become godless. So it requires time. So this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is to help them to develop consciousness very quickly. Yes. Otherwise, it will take millions of years. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścit yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> We are helping people to develop that original consciousness very quickly.

The mo... As you have got less developed consciousness,... Just like the dog and the girl, she is developed consciousness. Therefore the dog, less conscious, it is serving. Similarly, if you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious fully, then you have to serve <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> <span class="Italic">Kali-dāsa.</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To serve <span class="Italic">māyā</span> means to accept this material body. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will give you a dress according to your <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and you'll have to work. This will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Oh. So those who do not develop their Kṛṣṇa consciousness fully must again take a birth.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is the instruction of Ṛṣabhadeva, that "These rascals are working like madmen." <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ</span> means mad. And always doing mischievous, sinful activities. So this is not good. Because he does not know that for his mischievous sinful activities, he has got a body which is always miserable. So it will continue, to accept miserable body. Therefore it is not good. A doctor can see that "This man is infecting this disease and he will suffer." But the rascal man cannot understand that "I am infecting something and I'll have to suffer." [break] The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are trying to become happy by improving this material condition. But he does not know that he is becoming implicated more and more. Because he'll have to accept the body. And there are so many varieties of body. (devotees laugh at something) This is childish. That, our Girirāja took some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Girirāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Girirāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He said, "Everyone is God." Somebody said. So Girirāja said, "I am God?" "Yes, you are God." "Then I can take your money?" "Yes." And he gave him some money, all the money. (laughter) So out of sentiment, whatever money he had in his pocket, he gave him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> He was caught in his own philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> By the same trick, Madhudviṣa Swami once got someone to take all of his clothes off and give it to him. "If everything is all one, then you will not mind giving me your clothes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Their philosophy is "We are one. What is mine, that is mine. And your-also mine. (laughter) Therefore we are one." And as soon as you'll say, "No, why not your mine?" that is, that is not agreeable. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will live. Just like a dog live with you. But you are developed; he's not developed.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Similarly, when we associate with a spiritual master who has Kṛṣṇa consciousness, automatically we also have some taste.</div>
