<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> ...convert the Hindus to Christianity, the children. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Christian missionaries. They are trying to convert others, but they are closing their churches. They are selling their churches to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Finding new suckers. In South Africa they put up big <span class="Italic">paṇḍāls,</span> and because the Indian people, they have no entertainment in the evening, so they go there and they are entertained, and they learn how to sing the hymns that they have. Then you find that the children are singing the hymns because that's the songs that they're learning. If we can provide entertainment like that in the form of <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> then they'll also sing Hare Kṛṣṇa and become devotees of Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...own Christian priests, they asked me that "Why Christianity is dwindling? What we have done?" So I told them, "What you have not done?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "You have violated from the very beginning the orders of Christ, 'Thou shall not kill,' and you are killing, only killing. So what you have not done?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> They say that man has to dominate over the animals. They should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you should kill and eat them. Very good reasoning. "The father should dominate over children; therefore the children should be killed and eaten up." So rascals, and they are professing religious leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, if every moment we are killing in breathing and walking and doing so many things, and then it says, "Thou shalt not kill," so then hasn't God given us an instruction which is impossible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Conscientiously you should not. But unconsciously, if you do, that is excused. [break] ...<span class="Italic">na punar baddhyate(?). Āhlādinī-śakti,</span> it is pleasure potency. So pleasure potency is not painful to Kṛṣṇa. But it is painful. It is painful to us, conditioned souls. This Golden Moon (name of a bar?), everyone comes there for pleasure, but he is becoming implicated in sinful activities. Therefore it is not pleasure. It will give him pain, so many aftereffects. Sex life, even it is not illicit, still, it is painful, aftereffects. You'll have to take care of the children. You have to bear children. That is painful. You have to pay to the hospital for delivery, then education, then doctor's bill-so many painful. So this pleasure, sex pleasure, is followed by so many painful things. <span class="Italic">Tāpa-karī.</span> The same pleasure potency is there in the living being in little quantity, and as soon as they utilize it, it becomes painful. And the same pleasure potency in the spiritual world, Kṛṣṇa's dancing with <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> that is not painful. That is pleasing. [break] ...man, if he takes nice foodstuff it is painful. If a diseased man, if he takes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> He becomes more sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More sick. Therefore this life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> not to accept-voluntarily reject. Then it is nice. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...ments today are supporting the most outrageous sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The governments today are supporting the most outrageous, sinful activities. So how is it possible to reform the general mass of people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you mean to say the government is perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? They must be moved. Government means, nowadays, all rascals. They are elected by rascals and they are rascals. That is the difficulty. Everywhere you go, you will meet only rascals. <span class="Italic">Manda.</span> The definition is given, <span class="Italic">manda.</span> Even in our camp there are so many rascals. Just see the report. Even they have come to be reformed, they are rascals. They cannot give up their rascal habits. Therefore it has been generalized, <span class="Italic">manda:</span> "all bad." But only difference is that in our camp the bad's are being reformed; outside there is no reforming. There is hope of their being good, but outside there is no hope. That is the difference. Otherwise everyone is bad. Without any discrimination you can say. <span class="Italic">Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo [SB </span>1.1.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now, how the government will be good? This is also bad. Mahāprabhu's name is Patita-pāvana; He is delivering all bad men. In the Kali-yuga there is no good men at all-all bad. Strong you will have to become to deal with all bad men. [break] The seaweeds are there even in the middle ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They call it Sargasso. The call it the Sargasso Sea. It floats in the center of the ocean, seaweed. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the fort?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Just straight ahead, where the ship is there. There are two ships there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. That's where they come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> No, the next, where the white ship is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Not so small. They've had as many as thirty-five or forty, not all in the berths but in the harbor. They bring everything in from overseas, and then they take out the sugar cane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Generally they come from Europe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Everywhere, all over the world. They trade with the whole world-America, Hong Kong, Japan. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are collecting fish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> These little clams they eat. Inside the shell there's a slug they eat, meat. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...translated now <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Will you also maybe translate <span class="Italic">Caitanya-bhāgavata?</span> [break] ...by, Lord Caitanya's fame will spread all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> As time goes by, Lord Caitanya's fame will spread all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hawaii Island is better than this island. Huh? Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It never becomes cold there. It never becomes cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Here they suffer from the cyclone every year. And every fifteen years it is treacherous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cyclone, typhoon is there in Japan also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. Only thing, here there is Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Indian culture? They are killing cows. (laughter) What is Indian culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Remnants. Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their Indian culture is that some of them speak Hindi, that's all. (laughter) This is their Ind...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...last night that they're starting a foundation, Mahatma Gandhi Foundation, here, to teach Indian culture, and he said, "Not just the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but Indian culture." You mentioned that we should take Indian culture directly from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> not from here, not little from here, and little from there. [break] You give the example, Prabhupāda, that to fight with a declared enemy is very easy, but to fight with someone who is playing as a friend, although he is your enemy, is more difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is more dangerous than Buddha. What is that big building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They are building now a prison on the point there, a new prison. I tried to walk there one morning, and they stopped me because they are afraid someone may go in there and make some tunnel or some place where they can escape before they finish it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It looks like a hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. It will be very luxurious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> ...Vyāsadeva and Nara-Nārāyaṇa, they are still in the Himalayas meditating, why don't they come and join our parties and help this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by their...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are giving you chance to preach. They have given their books. Is it not sufficient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> Yes, it's great help. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...bones or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. It's coral. It's from coral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> An animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It's called an exoskeleton because it's on the outside instead of the inside. We have a skeleton inside the skin, but their skeleton is on the outside of the skin, and the flesh is within.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they trim the coconuts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They pull them down, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man 3:</span> They don't know how to cut. They cut with sticks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Do they cut them down before they're grown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> No, they let them ripen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then they eat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Minister for Youth was there last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> When you were speaking with those two boys last night, that was the Minister of Youth who was sitting with the High Commissioner. He was appreciating that they were coming to challenge, that they were understanding. They cannot understand their own so-called culture. They have not been able to get the young people here to adopt it. Instead they are trying to imitate the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Blind leading the blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. Did you understand the words, "The blind leading the blind"? Do you agree? [break] ...culture, the basic principle is mistaken, bodily concept of life. How it can be perfect? [break] ... world's present so-called culture based on misconception. Therefore it cannot be perfect. Whatever they are doing, it is failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can't satisfy anyone. Now people are under the conception that culture means that you can satisfy anything you like, any desire. Therefore there is birth control and so many things. So they are thinking that "If we can satisfy all of our desires, it is very nice culture."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where is satisfaction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They think that unhappiness comes from repression of one's desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They think that actually that we're suffering from so many desires, that we must be very poor creatures because we become devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why so many desires? Because one desire is not complete, therefore you desire next. Therefore the process of desiring is defective, and our process is to purify the desires, not to remain in the imperfect platform of desiring, but whatever desire you have got, just purify it. Then it will be satisfied. So desire produced by bodily concept of life will never be satisfied. Therefore some of them are trying to become desireless, the impersonalists. <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That is also impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man 3:</span> Still there is a desire to become desireless. [break] ...nice example for Mr. Seller, a <span class="Italic">murghee(?).</span> He thinks the rains are getting under and then cutting his slack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Expensive. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was one of those men over there. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One of the men over there made that sound, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They just came out of that dancing club.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They spend the whole night in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Getting drunk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They've become dog already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> One night and you're a dog. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...ready, Prabhupāda. We wake up in the morning, and instead of selfish desires you've taught us how to offer to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> you mentioned that the trees, they also can see, (in a) purport. So I was wondering, do all the various species of life, are they fully equipped in some fashion or another with all the various senses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Living being means possessing all the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Absolute is sentient thou hast proved, impersonality calamity thou hast moved." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...tree in Hare Krishna Land, they are so beautiful, heḥ? And what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> These are very short. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They are also torn by the cyclone. The cyclone has pulled up all the big ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man 3:</span> These are different in Durban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are not as fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better place than this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Very nice weather there. The people very much like us there too, Prabhupāda. Big crowds. Like us. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> ...bassa is nicer, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mombassa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Goloka</span> is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> You once said that is the nicest place in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Goloka</span> is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Durban is better or Mombassa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I've never been in Mombassa, I can't say, but Durban is very nice. We have a very nice house there for you to translate in for several weeks if you'd like. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is Brahmānanda's opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he's never been to Durban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> There's no one here who's been to both places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You did not go to Mombassa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Mombassa I have been, but not Durban. So you will have to judge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's many mosquitoes in Mombassa, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And malaria. That you don't find. No? When I went to the innoculation center and I said I was going to Kenya, they gave us both malaria tablets. They said, "Take one a week." That's true. But you don't find malaria in Durban. (end)</div>
