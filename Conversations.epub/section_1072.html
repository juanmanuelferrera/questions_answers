<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least once in a month you must be shaven headed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Actually, we usually shave more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> We usually shave more than once a month. Two weeks. 'Cause after even two weeks it looks a little dirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We can get very good wigs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no need. It is simply... That is also mental concoction. Nowadays, if you go with coat-pant shaven headed, nobody will criticize you. It has become a practi... Russians, they used... That Krushchev I have seen. Bald head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, bald head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't have a <span class="Italic">śikhā,</span> that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh? It is practice only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, it's nice. We shouldn't be afraid to do that. Then it will become more and more accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's so timely. Once we start diverting, like on these records I was thinking after you told me not to do it. We started. Now there's so many. Everyone's into records. Everyone wants to diversify into so many other areas. There's no end to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you were in Los Angeles you heard that new record by Kṛṣṇakānti.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This pop music? This tape that you just got of that Western style music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Apparently in a new BBT newsletter which just came yesterday afternoon there's a statement by Rāmeśvara that you were asked whether this record should be played in the temples and you said, "Why not in the temples?" Hari-śauri thought that you said "not in the temples," Rāmeśvara said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not in the temple. I... I want... If the wordings are all right, so there is no... If there is no mistake in the set-up of the wording, the change of musical tune, that is not harmful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This one tape that Alex has made, he gave me a copy in Bombay to listen. I just played it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, this vibration, you can make in different tune. We are already doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We're talking about these songs that they are writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Philosophy songs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore we have to see the words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like this "caterpillar had a change of heart."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> If the words are all right, then they can be played in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because no one can hear the words. It's the pop music that people hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Actually the words are just like modern pop songs. You can't tell really what it means. I suggested to those people. I said, "Why don't you put music to Prabhupāda's books? Take the words straight from your..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, Prabhupāda's approved this method for attracting <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, not for devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But the thing is once you become a devotee, we don't need...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That kind of music also reminds us of past bad activities, sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The question is whether should it be played in the temple or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple may not be played. What is use of playing in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know from practical experience, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that... I just played this Alex's record. It's all current pop music with English philosophy wording. And all the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> were so agitated, they came to my room to listen and they were, you know, really making fun of it like it was a pop...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because that style of music it reminds us of the nightclubs or whatever it might be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I said it is better not to make these records.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just your these records and <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> records should be played, I think. There are so many tapes of your records.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This style that they are doing now, they explain that they wanted that because then that way, they'll be able get them played on the radio. Otherwise they won't play <span class="Italic">bhajanas</span> or anything on the radio. But there's a distinction between that kind of music and pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness music. Even though the words indicate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, most of the songs are written in such a way that it's indirect. It's not directly Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you can't hear the words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, indirect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They give this thing, "The caterpillar changed his mind," like that. It provokes some speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, indirect for gross outsiders, not for us. Therefore they should not be played in the temple. Gross outsider only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So, Prabhupāda, the New York temple has just produced a ballet on <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> and one boy, Vijayadeva, just came back and he brought a slideshow on that ballet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ballet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They did a ballet, the New York theater, Sudāmā Swami and his group. But that ballet is accompanied by a classical Western record in background. It's a twenty med... They have just played the whole record as background music. And I know, we showed it in Bombay and none of the devotees liked it. They told me to stop that show because they said it's all <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Everyone saw it, Girirāja and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they should be restricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean, their playing... Serious devotees don't like it, like Girirāja walked out of the show and he told me to stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why it was played, this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They just brought it from New York, so we didn't know what it contained. But they are doing this in other centers. (end)</div>
