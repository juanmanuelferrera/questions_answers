<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> ...regarding this <span class="Italic">Candi-pat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Candi-pat</span> means you, if you properly read, you get some material profit. That's all. No spiritual profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> There is no special significance in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You get material profit. [break] <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, (sic:) <span class="Italic">alpavat tu phalaṁ teṣām:</span> "The result of material profit is for a short duration of time," <span class="Italic">tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām,</span> "and these things are desired by less intelligent class of men." His real need is how to gain his spiritual life. That is his real need. But he does not want that. He wants some material profit for the time being. This is less intelligent. Suppose if somebody gives you some money and he says, "Tomorrow I shall take it away," will you... (laughs) So <span class="Italic">tad bhavaty alpa-medhasā.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajanty anya-</span><i class="calibre3">devatāḥ</i>:<span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.20] "They worship demigods, bewildered by lusty desires." And so long we have got lusty desires, we have to change our body, and that we do not know, what kind of body we are going to get next birth. Therefore, without knowing this, if we become mad after material profit, then less intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yogendra(?), you wanted to ask Swamiji a question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> If we become completely Kṛṣṇa conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> If we follow the Kṛṣṇa conscious path... Now, take for example our wedding ceremonies. Now, the first thing that we take, the Ganapati, there is <span class="Italic">Ganasyainava</span>(?), and there is various other deities that we have to respect. Now, what happens in his case?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, then to worship Ganapati, there is no harm. But if you take Ganapati as independent God, then your Kṛṣṇa consciousness is hampered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But in certain ceremonies these things are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any ceremony. If you know the constable is constable and the president is president, then it is all right. But if you think constable is president, then you are misguided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> (Hindi exchange with Prabhupāda and other Indians)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> [break] ...this country, what do you think is the best way of establishing the <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> or the centers, and which way we can help in this matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got so many <span class="Italic">āśramas.</span> You can see how we are doing. We have got hundred and two temples all over the world. You come to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, I have been to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this time you come and see our temple in Vṛndāvana. We have got, India, four, five temples. We have got in London, New York. In London we have got two temples, big, big. One is very big. In New York we have got, Los Angeles. Everywhere we have got. Here also, yesterday's paper, there was some advertisement, one Mr. Desai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Jayanti Desai, yes. Yes, he wants to give some charities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not give us? Then we can make a nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I think we could... [break] ...him and see what they are asking for applications from various charitable organizations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have come temporarily. Why don't you approach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, we will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he is known to you, you can approach, that "Here is a good cause, International..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I will send a message to him to come and see you this evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that will be very nice. Then I can talk. Yes. When you will bring him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I think you are meeting the officials of various organizations this evening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They've been invited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, the organizations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Different organizations in Durban. Six p.m.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Six p.m. Yes. I will send a message to him today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also Dr. Desai, his brother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes. Dr. Desai has been very helpful in establishing societies and schools and charitable organizations. Yes, I will also send a message to Dr. Desai to come and see you. Dr. Desai sacrificed all his medical practice and all for the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (wind blowing) <span class="Italic">Pranair arthair dhiya vacaḥ śreya acaraṇam...</span> [break] ...by words, by intelligence, everyone should serve Kṛṣṇa, then life is successful. <span class="Italic">Pranair arthair dhiya vacaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> What of meetings, religious meetings, especially here in South Africa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> In South Africa here especially, number of religious meetings, they start off with the <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī mantra</span> three times, and at the end of the meeting they have a <span class="Italic">ṣantipat.</span> Now is there any real necessity for a religious meeting to start off with the <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī mantra</span> and end with <span class="Italic">santipat</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's not bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But I don't see that being practiced in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That includes everything. It is called <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> It includes all <span class="Italic">mantras. Gāyatrī mantra</span> is not to be chanted in the public loudly. That is not the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Not to be chanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the public loudly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in this country we have to do army training, and on a Sunday we have to attend a church service. We have to attend it. Is it all right to say that we won't attend it because we follow Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or must we go anyway? It's sort of a Christian denomination service on a Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good. Those who are doing nothing, for them to attend the church at least for one hour, that is better than... Something is better than nothing, you see. That is good. People have completely forgotten God. They are doomed. So better to remember at least for some time. That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> We would like you to stay more longer in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> We would like to request you to stay more longer in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you start a good center I will stay and see that things are going on. (aside:) Just take this stick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Then I could... I think we would be able to benefit from you much more. See, your arrival in this period in Durban, with so many functions that we are carrying on today in this whole week, that people were sort of distributed and quite a lot of them were unable to even come to your meetings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. No, our meetings were well attended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We have had full house all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, I know your house, but you could have had even more than full house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> There are about four hundred thousand Indians alone here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes. The reason of that Navaratri festival, these <span class="Italic">Ārya samājīs</span> they have had, well in advance. They had their celebrations and all, so a lot of people were unable to come. Do you think it will be possible for you to come back to Durban from Johannesburg, after your Johannesburg stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I can come back. There is no harm. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> And when you have these <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> and all, and how to serve the poor people in the way of welfare?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> We are giving two thousand, three thousand men each center, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> And also to rehabilitate them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have giving them shelter also, food, cloth, everything, giving them proper chance to live peacefully and be God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> And in the way of hospitals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hospitals, there are many, but real hospitals... to cure the material disease, there is no hospital. They are... There are hundreds and thousands of hospitals for curing the disease of the body, but there is no hospital to cure the disease of the soul. That is the defect. So we are opening hospital for curing the disease of the soul. They have no information about the soul throughout the whole world. Even so-called religious organizations, they have no information about the soul. They go to religious ceremonies for material profit. They do not know what is the necessity of the soul and what is the disease of the soul. They do not know. [break] ...<span class="Italic">nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> What is the goal of life, these people, they do not know, <span class="Italic">mūḍhas. Mūḍha</span> means rascals, <span class="Italic">gadha.</span> They do not know what is the goal of life. They take calculation of the duration of life, that fifty, sixty, or hundred years. That's all. Beyond this, after this, they do not know. Yes. That is the defect. [break] Now, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that this temporary attempt to become happy-<span class="Italic">antavanta phalaṁ teṣām</span>-it will end with the end of the body. But they do not know beyond this. Therefore <span class="Italic">alpam-medhasām,</span> they are less intelligent. Just like a child playing. He likes to play and does not go to school. So do you think that is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore we are doing like that. We are concerned that "I have got this body. Let me enjoy to the fullest extent and don't mind what I am going to have in future. It doesn't matter."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> You get attracted by a lot of side attractions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the education is so defective that even university students, if I say that "You are going to be a dog," they say, "What is the harm if I become?" They say like that. The education is so defective, they don't mind to become a dog. They think, "It is a facility to become a dog because I can have sex on the street without any restrictions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes. I mean they have lost their self-respect for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No consideration. They are actually like cats and dogs. This is going on. [break] Nobody knows what is soul; nobody knows what is the goal of life; nobody knows what is the necessity of the soul. These things are not discussed, neither they know it. So-called religious institution or so-called..., they do not know. It is only mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and that... They do not take care of this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They manufacture their own ways of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Is there any other books before <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> there are. Yes. But what is the purpose of <span class="Italic">Veda</span>? The purpose of <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is to understand God. If you do not understand God... Just like the <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājīs.</span> They are concerned with <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they say. But they do not know what is God. They say, "I am God." This is their knowledge. If he is God, who is going to worship him? Nobody comes to kick on his face, and still, he says, "I am God." This is going on. How you become God? Who worships you? But still, he will say, "I am God." You see. Such foolishness is going on. <span class="Italic">Ārya. Ārya</span> means advanced, and this is their advancement. <span class="Italic">Ārya</span> means advanced, and this is their advancement that they think, "I am God." Just see. Everyone can think like that. Then what is the use of advancement? This is going on. [break]...<span class="Italic">sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ. Veda</span> means knowledge. So the ultimate knowledge is to know God. But if you do not know God, then what is the value of your knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Quite right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you say like a rascal that "I am God," is that knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> It's no knowledge at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Still they claim they are advanced Aryans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> And Vallabhācārya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vallabhācārya, he was a Vaiṣṇava. He worships Kṛṣṇa, Bal Kṛṣṇa. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Indian man asks Prabhupāda if he speaks Gujarati in Gujarati or Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na Gujarati, ne.</span> Hindi I can. [break] ...the four <span class="Italic">sampradāyas:</span> Rāmānuja, Madhvācārya, then Viṣṇu Svāmī. Vallabhācārya belongs to the Viṣṇu Svāmī group, and we belong to Madhvācārya, so there is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> She's a very staunch believer in Vallabhācārya and Puti Mahārāja(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mostly Gujaratis are Vallabhācārya follower. I know that. That is good. So you are worshiping Bal Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Bal Kṛṣṇa, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. (Hindi) ...there one opinion of the Vallabhācārya <span class="Italic">sampradāya...</span> (end)</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And this side, they are coming from Europe?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> This side, coming from the oil countries, coming down the coast, and also coming� (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How long they can stay in the water?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> If it's warm weather they can stay all day.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b><i class="calibre3">Acchā</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> In the cold weather, a few hours. They put on these black suits made out of a certain fabric-it's called a wet suit-and they are able to stay in the water much longer. It insulates, insulates the body from the cold water.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Going for surfing?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> These gentlemen? No, I don't think so. These young boys are. (break) �surf, we tell them, "Yes, we surf in the ocean of <i class="calibre3">bhakti-rasa.</i>"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu. </i>(break) � <i class="calibre3">karma bandha phasa:</i> one after another. <i class="calibre3">Asate vilāsa: </i>material enjoyment means implicated in unnecessary activities. If people are satisfied, plain living, then these things are not necessary: go into the ocean, find out oil, then bring it in the port, then distribute it, so many, one after another. That, this kind of civilization, they think it is advanced. And to live very plainly, minimizing this unnecessary activity, they think it is not civilization.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Primitive.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Primitive, yes. But primitive meat-eating is continued. That is not to be stopped, primitive drinking and meat-eating.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Would you like a tissue, Srila Prabhupada? A tissue?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No. (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>� it is misdirected and simply based on sense gratification, has no purpose. So people may question us that we are putting forward a civilization which India had practiced for thousands of years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Why you speak of India?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Well, because when we speak of Vedic culture, at least contemporarily speaking, people think of India. Even few hundred years ago, all the <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>All right, India. Then?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>So then the point is that they criticize that how we can preach such a civilization to the Western countries if even it's not working in India today. Although theoretically it's perfect, practically it's not working.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No. Practically, because you have preached your culture in India; therefore they have lost their own culture. The Western, the Britishers were for two hundred years and they preached. Their policy was to kill the Indian culture. Because that report of Lord McCauley, after studying Indian situation, the report was to the Parliament that "If you keep India as Indian, then you will not be able to rule over them," so therefore there was regular policy to kill Indian civilization. And because they were on the governing power, they could do it. Therefore India lost its own culture and victimized by the Western culture. This is the position. Just they are learning how to eat meat, how to drink wine, how to dress them with coat and pant, how to go to the hotel, illicit sex-these things are�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Imported.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>In India it was unknown. They did not know. In our childhood we have seen that they did not know how to drink tea even.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Tea?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Nobody would drink tea, no family. We have seen it. And for drinking, for drinking tea, drinking wine, regular propaganda was done. There was a tea assess(?) (tea sets?) committee. Men these foreigners, they began to grow tea in India in the beginning for exporting to Europe and America� Later on, they began to pay some tax to the government. That was known as "tea assess(?) committee." The tea assess(?) committee, in order to popularize drinking tea, they used to hold stall, just like here in park and public places, and they would prepare very tasty tea and distribute free.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Free.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. And advertise, "If you drink tea, then you will not feel very much hungry. Your health will be improved," and so on, so on. In this way they distribute pamphlet and giving free. Just like we distribute <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i>, they used to distribute very tasteful tea, and people liked it: "Oh, it is very nice." Then they began to drink. Vigorous propaganda. And culturally, in our school days they wrote� One Mr. N. Ghosh, he, bribed by the Britishers, he wrote one book, <i class="calibre3">England's Work in India. </i>So all the, just like <i class="calibre3">Sati</i> rites�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b><i class="calibre3">Sati</i> rite.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. That "Later on, after the death of husband in some places the wife was forced to go to the fire, so the Britishers stopped it. And they introduced railway for going to the pilgrims and so many, and they constructed bridges to make easy to go from one country to another." And people took it very seriously, that British government is very nice. And they were publishing in outside country that "India is uncivilized. We are making them civilized. And as soon as they are civilized, then we hand over the charge to them. That is our noble mission." And they were exploiting. All raw materials was being taken away and the necessities of India, especially cloth, was being supplied. And the local weavers, their hands cut off. So many thing they, tainting� And everything bad. Just like Jawaharlal Nehru. He became a first-class victim.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>First-class?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Victim of European propaganda. He used to take "Anything Indian, bad. Anything Indian, bad." Not only he. Later on, all the so-called educated persons, they took it for granted that "Whatever is done in London, that is first-class, and whatever is Indian original, that is all bad." And they controlled the native princes. So many things. It is a big history, how they killed India's original culture. And then Hindu-Muslim riots, friction, fighting between Hindus and Muslims and dividing them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>You said that the British instigated the Muslims.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>How did they do that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Oh, you� Nowadays you pay somebody, and he will do anything. So they appointed this Jhinna. He found that he is a very, intelligent lawyer. He was in the Congress. So there was dissension. There must be. So once this Jhinna was to be the president of the Congress, and the Patel, he frustrated. So Jhinna became angry, and at this moment the Britishers took it. He was a very intelligent barrister. So he instigated that, "You form a party, Muslim league. And whatever money is required for propaganda, we shall pay." So regular subscription was raised from all big, big British companies, mercantile, to pay him: "Whatever money, you organize the Muslims against the Hindus." And he did it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Jhinna, he was Muslim.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>He was neither Muslim nor Hindu. He was an intelligent barrister coming from the� His father, means not real father, his father was Parsi, and he kept one Mohammedan girl. So the Jhinna is the issue of this� (to passerby) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Hare Kṛṣṇa. Today at 2:30 we have program at Peter Mather Hall. Yes. Come along.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian: </b>Not Carlisle Street?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>No. Carlisle Street is the Arya-samāj temple. (laughs) So�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>"So if you make propaganda and pay money to go against the Hindus and incite them"-gradually it developed. And the money was being paid by the Britishers. And he saw that money is coming. He had no feeling, national or� He wanted money, that's all. For money you can purchase anything nowadays.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Why did the British build all so many railroads?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>For drawing raw materials from villages and bring it to the Calcutta, Bombay port and export to their country because their country does not produce anything. They're starving. Still England, London, is maintained by importing goods from Africa, India, here, there. They have no food there. They can grow some potato, maybe� Potato only, That was the reason of expanding their empire. They had no food at home, England. They were manufacturing cotton cloth. That cotton was not grown in their country. It was brought from Egypt. They manipulated things in such a way. In America also they wanted to do that, but Americans, just understanding, separated, George Washington. In America I have heard that each family was to maintain a British soldier. You know that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>No, I didn't know that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. And they brought tea from India and other places and sell it in America. Their whole policy was they exploit the whole world and bring money in London. That's all. And one who will do that, he will be honored by the state, given Earl of some small village. It has no value. Earl of this whole�, this man�, place, Lord of this. (laughter) A few acres of land and he is Lord of Chelmsford. And they will be given big, big post, governor, viceroy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Why did Nehru, though� He was so closely associated with Gandhi, and Gandhi was for getting the foreign products out. Why did Nehru go so much against that policy? Why did Nehru?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, Nehru, he was searching after some big post. That's all. All these political agitators, they want the big post, that's all. You give them big post, and they will be satisfied. They will no more agitate. Political agitators means they want some prize post from the government. That's all. Make them some minister, and they will be no more agitator.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>But he is considered to be very religious man in the eyes of the masses.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Who?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Nehru.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Nehru?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Yes. I know one Gujarati school, they have a book. And in the book it is taught that Gandhi, Nehru�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is propaganda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is propaganda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>(break) � in the last fifty years or so that especially that the Indian culture has been squashed and perverted by the British.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Is that because of mass communication, Prabhupada? Is that because of mass communication?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Mass communication or no�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Radio, and things like this.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, if you want to make mass communication, you can do anything. (break) Due to industrialization, all intelligent men, they came in the city. In the village it was deserted. So there was no improvement in the village, and people preferred to come to the city, means industry, business. So India's basic principle was village life. Now that is lost. The intelligent class men, <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</i> they left villages for earning more money in the cities, and only the <i class="calibre3">śūdras, </i>less intelligent class of men, less than <i class="calibre3">śūdras</i>, they remained. So what they will do? So village became deserted. Still you'll go and see in Indian villages, especially in Bengal, so many big, big palatial buildings, they are lying vacant.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>In the villages?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Because the proprietor left and the poor cultivators, <i class="calibre3">śūdras, </i>they are accustomed to live in cottages. India's civilization was based on village residence. They would live very peacefully in the villages. In the evening there would be <i class="calibre3">bhdgavata-kathā. </i>They will hear. That was Indian culture. They had no artificial way of living, drinking tea, and meat-eating and wine and illicit sex. No. Everyone was religious and satisfied by hearing-what we are just introducing-<i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā, Purāṇas, </i>and live simple life, keeping cows, village life as it is exhibited by Kṛṣṇa, Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa, if He liked, He could have lived in the cities. (pause) So the education was meant for teaching people to hate everything Indian.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Hate everything Indian.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. That was the policy of education. So as soon as one became graduate and educated, he began to hate everything Indian original, and if he would get some clerk's business, service in some office, and his life is successful. That is still going on. So our car is here?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>It's just up here, Srila Prabhupada.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>The <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> became by caste <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i>. He will do everything nonsense and still, he remains a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa. </i>But you can introduce the original Vedic culture in this Europe and America. You have understood. You can do it. By this material civilization they will never be happy, and it is risky. That they do not know. They do not believe in the transmigration of the soul. So irresponsibly� Or just like these elderly persons, how they are wasting time.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Just sitting on the beach.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Not only sitting, they have no other engagement. They do not know how human life should be utilized. They do not know. They are simply taking consideration of the body, running or skating or this or that, but they have no other engagement. They do not believe that there is soul and that soul's business is first business. They do not know that, neither they do accept it. They are under nature's law, very simply explained in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā, dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā. </i>By nature's law you have to change your body. It is evident. Still, they will not believe. We're changing body every moment, and they will say, big, big professors, that after the body is finished, everything is finished. This is <i class="calibre3">ajñāna. </i>And that is going on as education, whole world. "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." The whole world is in ignorance, so we are giving them wise instruction. They are thinking, "These people are crazy men." That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>How were the leaders, though, of India so weak when the British first occupied that they allowed this all to take place?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>There was no Indian leader. That was occupied by the Mohammedans. They were deteriorating. Yes. Besides that, Indian mass of people, they were never trained to become nationalist. They thought, "Let anyone become king. It doesn't matter. We� Let us live peacefully, and whatever due tax we shall pay. That's all." When the Mohammedans came the people did not think that these are foreigners. "It does not matter, Mohammedan, Hindu." But they did not think so far that gradually it will deteriorate. Even Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, he has favored the British government because they did not interfere with the religious affair.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>(entering car) Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Over the Muslims.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, Britishers. The Muslims interfered. They wanted to propagate Islamism. Not all, some of them. But Britishers, although they were spreading Christianism, still, outwardly they were neutral about religious affairs. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura preferred that "Britishers are good. They do not interfere with our religious affair." So the idea is that India-you may say primitive or whatever you want-they wanted to make progress of the soul. They did not care who is ruling. So "Whatever tax is due we shall pay. Let us do our own business." That was India's attitude. They never thought in terms of nationalism. That was never educated. They were never educated.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>(to driver) Go down this street, Prabhu.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Nationalism was unknown to India. They never thought.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhargava:</b> Why did Kṛṣṇa allow the Muslims to enter and do so much damage to the�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Kṛṣṇa is your father's servant that you do something wrong and Kṛṣṇa has to check it? Is your Kṛṣṇa your father's servant? Then why do you ask this question? If you allow somebody to cut your head, has Kṛṣṇa to come to save you? Why do you ask this nonsense question? You are Kṛṣṇa conscious. <i class="calibre3">Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu. </i>If you cut your own head, what Kṛṣṇa will do? In the same term, nationalism, as Vedic culture is Kṛṣṇa's national affair, your disease is there. Why Kṛṣṇa will come to save the Vedic culture? What business He has got? If you are spoiling it, then why Kṛṣṇa will come? Spoil, and suffer. (break) � the same question in a different way, "Why India? Why Kṛṣṇa?" as if Kṛṣṇa is Indian. Kṛṣṇa is Indian? Then why do you ask this question, that "Kṛṣṇa will come to save India's culture?"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhargava:</b> Not the Indian culture but the Vedic culture, Kṛṣṇa's culture.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Vedic culture, He has given, <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā. </i>Why don't you accept it? You don't accept; then suffer. He has given His instruction. The government gives you the law. Now, when you violate, the government will come to stop you? You violate and suffer. Why do you expect that "When I violate the laws, the government men will come and stop me?" Why do you expect like that? Eh? The government can give you the law book. You consult and do accordingly. You'll be happy. And if you don't, against, the government man is not coming to stop you. You do and suffer. Kṛṣṇa says, "Whenever there is discrepancy, I come." That is general, not for India. Vedic culture is not for India. It is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>It'sjust that people have taken India as a model of our philosophy, and sometimes people judge our philosophy by India's practical application.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is a� That is a fact. India was practically following the Vedic culture. That's a fact. But now they have given up, so what Kṛṣṇa can do?They have been victimized. So if you give up your own culture�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>But this propaganda is going on even here, that anything which is Indian is inferior, and anything which is European is good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, that is the propaganda always. That is going on. That I already explained, that this was the propaganda of the Britishers, "Anything Indian is bad." You see, they wanted to stop our Ratha-yātrā in London as soon as they saw that it is becoming popular. Even in India the government doesn't want that Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should go ahead. It is the demonic principle-Kṛṣṇa should be cut down. That is the way of demonic civilization. Stop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now we are preaching, "No illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating." Do you think people like it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Everyone is against this movement. So who is coming to save us? Nobody is coming. Kṛṣṇa is saving. Otherwise it would have been stopped long, long ago. I was thinking that "As soon as I shall propose all these things, immediately these American people will ask me to go back home. Instead of go back to Godhead, "You go back to India." (laughter) So it is Kṛṣṇa's kindness that you, a few boys and girls, have accepted this principle. Otherwise who likes this? Nobody likes. Nobody likes. Lord Zetland flatly said, "Oh, it is impossible." This is the life and soul of the modem civilization. just see the advertisement-sex. You see, illicit sex. Who would like our movement? Nobody likes. What is this picture means? Sex, that's all. So many advertise�, wine advertisement, meat-eating, gambling-everything.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>But how can we prove Kṛṣṇa scientifically?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>First of all let them prove their theory. Then we shall prove ours. We are proving. We have got our own way. But why they are speaking all this nonsense? First of all let him prove that he is genuine. Then our turn will be next. Ours is very easy. Kṛṣṇa said to sun-god, and sun-god said to his son, his son, his son. It is coming like that. Where is the difficulty? Again Kṛṣṇa says, "Now it is mismanaged. It is lost, so I am saying again to you Arjuna." So what Arjuna has understood, we are understanding the same way. How Arjuna understood it, that is written in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>. Where is the� We have no difficulty. But you jump over: "There is link," that "Once only from monkey came." What is this nonsense? We have to believe this? Has it any sense? And because Mr. Darwin is speaking we have to accept it? We cannot�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Well, certain changes take place. Just like when it is very hot, if you are in a hot climate all the time your blood thins.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That's all right. No, no. This is not�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Well, if you take that further, all of these changes that mount up to some big physical change.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No change is taken. The nature is working symmetrically always. The sun is rising in the morning. That is going on for million, million, million, millions of years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Gradually the change has taken place in a very scientific way, step by step.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What change has taken place?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>First the hairs fell off�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Morning� In the morning the sun rises on the eastern side. That is going on. What change has taken place? This flower, seasonal flower is� Now seasonal changes-winter, summer, spring-everything is going on symmetrically. There is no change. Because it is going on symmetrically, therefore we can say that February, next February will be very nice season here. Why? Because we have got experience last February, so we are certain the same thing will happen in the next February. Therefore we can say. There is no such change. Nature's way. <i class="calibre3">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi. </i>It is very symmetrical. Everything is going on nicely, nature's way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>One of the strong points of Darwin's theory�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I don't find. Simply foolishness I accept. And rascal, foolish like you, will believe. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>They argue that five thousand years ago they have no history, so they think that before that time� </div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>"They think." That is their rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Formerly there was no civilization. Therefore like monkey.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>"They think." That is their� We don't "think." We have got millions of years' history. Why we shall think with them, with these rascals? They may think, the rascal. A child may think like something, but a elderly man will not think like that. Because they are thinking like that, we have to think with them?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Then? Because the rascals are thinking in some way, we have to believe that? First of all let them prove that they are sane men. They are all insane rascals. Why shall I take their words? We are taking words from Kṛṣṇa, who is accepted the Supreme by all the <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>, all the great sages. Why shall I go to this rascal Darwin? We are not so fools. We cannot accept.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Well, the <i class="calibre3">Bible </i>is just some story. I mean, the <i class="calibre3">Bible </i>is<i class="calibre3"> </i>just some story. Why should we believe that all of a sudden there was�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, <i class="calibre3">Bible </i>is not authorized because it was compiled after Jesus Christ finished.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>No, the <i class="calibre3">Bible </i>was there� <i class="calibre3">Old</i> <i class="calibre3">Testament </i>has been there for thousands of years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b><i class="calibre3">Old</i> <i class="calibre3">Testament, </i>but what is going on, <i class="calibre3">Bible�</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>That <i class="calibre3">Genesis, </i>where it says the creation�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>That's just some story. Why should we believe it? There's nothing else to believe. Why not believe this Darwin?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, but you are not believing <i class="calibre3">Bible. Bible, </i>they say that the earth is square. So nobody is believing. So one point is sufficient, that it is not perfect. One point is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>(laughing) It says the earth is square?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, they� They say it. Formerly they believed that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Probably does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> Oh, you mean flat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>You'll fall down. If you go very far, you'll fall down. Just like a child thinks. <i class="calibre3">Bible, </i>so many have been proved not authorized. Therefore <i class="calibre3">Bible </i>is not authorized.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>So we had this religion, and everybody was saying that this was the correct way, the official policy. So everybody knew this was nonsense. So Darwin is very scientific, so we accept the science.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What is that science? He said, "By chance, once, nature came." Is that � ? That is not science. We don't find, nature's way, by chance it comes. No. As soon as you talk something nonsense, your whole statement will be accepted as nonsense because you are nonsense. What is the value of your statement? This is our test. Once you say something nonsense, you are wholesale nonsense. That is our test. You cannot say, "I am sorry. It was incorrect," no. That is not allowed. Then your whole statement is incorrect. This is our� <b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Scientists are always doing that. They're always saying that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Therefore they're all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>"Last year we made a mistake. Now it's all right."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>"Now we advance." And what is the guarantee that it is all right? You will advance again. That means you are always incorrect.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>But people always think that it's always getting better.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Therefore they are rascals. This is called <i class="calibre3">māyā</i>. They remain rascal; still, they think that they are advancing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Nobody thinks about that point, nobody.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>If everyone is rascal, how he will think? We say mūḍha, all rascals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>But when the early scientists, they were analyzing the body, they tried to find the soul. They would look for the soul in different parts of the body. They couldn't find it with their microscopes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That's all right. That is his rascaldom. He's a rascal. But soul is there. Then find out what is the missing point of a dead man. If there is no soul, something is missing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Well, actually they've pinned it down to a little bit of a molecule that breaks down.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That's all right. Bring that molecule.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>They're working on it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh? Again, "working on it." You see. This is bluff. This is bluff.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Now they are inventing these different DNA and RNA molecules to change people by injecting them with these different things before they are born, making new people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is not very difficult thing. If you make some vegetable, if you add more sugar it becomes sweet. If you add more salt it becomes salty. That you can do. That is not very difficult. Our question is wherefrom the life comes? That is our� So they do not give any answer to this. That is their foolishness. What is that life? They say life developed from chemical. Now do it. By chemical combination make in one egg and give it to the fomenting machine. What is that? Fomenting machine? They have got heating machine?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Incubator.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Incubator. Put it there. Then we shall accept your science. Why don't you do that? Then your all theories are useless. This is practical.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>It seems much more practical to make a computer than to make an egg. I mean, a computer�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Whatever it may be, do it. And from that egg, you get chicken. Then I shall accept that you are scientist. Otherwise you are rascal, talking all madman's proposal. Do it. Ask them. Write in the paper that "Prabhupāda was speaking like that, a challenge to the scientist: 'Is there any scientist who can make an egg which is put in the incubator and gradually it comes to become �'"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>They will think we are completely crazy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh? Well, then kick on their face, on their nose, rascal. We are crazy or you are crazy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>But who wants to make eggs?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh? No, no, it is an experiment. You say life comes from chemical. So by chemical combination make an egg and do it. Begin from this. Then we shall see others. This is very easy. If you have already analyzed the yellow portion of the egg, the white portion of the egg and that outer plastering can be done. Nowadays there is� What is called?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Plastic.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Plastic. It can be done. Do it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Make a chicken.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Make a chicken or so many birds. If not chicken, make a sparrow. Do something. Do something. Why you should be misled by them, these rascals? Challenge him. Challenge them publicly that "These rascals are misleading. Don't accept them. They're simply misleading."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Well, they're the best we have. They're the best we have. We have nobody. Who else is going to take care of us?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No, at least� We � just like we challenge, they cannot give answer. This should be proved. Then they will be proved that they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>The whole scientific craze seems to be settling down anyway. It seems to be dying down.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>It must die. The scientists, they admit now, "What we shall do? We have bluffed in so many ways. Now what is the next bluffing?" Their bluff, last bluffing, was going to the moon planet, and everything is failed. Then what is next bluffing? That is their problem, how to keep their big, big post?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>There's nothing left to do.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. They have finished all their theories. Still, they could not do anything. This is their position. (break) Margarine is also another bluff. It is oil; it is taken as <i class="calibre3">ghee, </i>er, butter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>They say it's very healthy for you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>They will say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>It doesn't have all those cholesterols.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Otherwise how they will sell? They will say. They will present anything nonsense in flowery language, and people will be cheated. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>Americans can't stand this butter and <i class="calibre3">ghee. </i>When we cook in these pure things like ghee, they become very upset.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Because meat-eaters.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>If it's not impure they don't like it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Meat-eaters cannot digest <i class="calibre3">ghee. </i>Therefore in America, all of a sudden change of diet in our�, their stomach become upset. Just like animal, dogs, they cannot eat this <i class="calibre3">ghee</i> preparation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>They can't take it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>They can't take it. So these meat-eaters, like dogs, they cannot digest. (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>In our philosophy, how did man come about? They'll ask us what is our philosophy how man came about.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Man came from man. The first man is Brahmā. From him came. And Brahmā came from Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu. So this is easy. Brahmā appeared from Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>So the first created being was a man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, Brahmā, a first-class man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>Even before the plants. Even before the plants.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, because man can create everything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: </b>That means Genesis in the <i class="calibre3">Bible </i>is wrong, because they say that first there were plants and then trees and then after man came.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>No, first they say that there was a man did that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>They say Adam and Eve.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>But they say first that the plants and the fish and the trees and the birds�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Then Adam, Eve.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa</b> <b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa: </b>Then, afterwards, that after creating so many things, the plants and the trees, God was still lonely.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Brahmā � Brahmā, when he was created, he was in darkness. He could not see anything. "What to do? What � ? Why I am?" Then he <i class="calibre3">tapasya</i>, meditation. Then he was given intelligence. Then, gradually, everything�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>It seems that the Christians' idea of God is our idea of Brahmā. Their God is like Brahmā. He's just a creator.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What is their idea? I do not know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> Their idea is that in the beginning there was darkness until God created the light. Then he created the different heavenly planets and the oceans and the inanimate things. Then He created�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Then it is like Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa: </b>It is like Brahmā. And their heaven and hell is like the upper and lower planetary systems. It's all little bit of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Little difference, maybe, but the basic�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> They say that Adam was created�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Then their God created. God created. So that is all right. We also say God created Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> Then they say that woman was created from a rib of Adam.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is also correct. That is also possible. Created from God, so that is accepted. The description may be little different. That doesn't matter. But God is the origin of all creation. If that is accepted, this is nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> They also have this Noah and his ark thing, where all the earth became covered with water.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Devastation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> It's like a Matsya <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>So that is acceptable. Description may be little different. That doesn't matter. But God is the origin. <i class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</i> also says, <i class="calibre3">janmādy asya yataḥ</i>, that "Absolute Truth is that from where everything comes." And the <i class="calibre3">Bible, </i>it is said, "God created this earth." So that is acceptable. Then Darwin says that all of a sudden a man was created. Wherefrom it came out? What is the first creation according to Darwin?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> Very small microbes. And then they developed to many-celled animals and amoebas and�</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>So how this microbe was created?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> Spontaneous generation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Spontaneous? And it is known to you only, Mr. Darwin? You are the only intelligent man. You could understand. And you are talking so foolish, and still, we have to accept it. (end)</div>
