<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and it is a fact, he did not fix it. I wanted both of you to take various detailed photographs of that Capitol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> The Capitol Building. For what purpose, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall have picture, planetarium in Māyāpura. (aside:) That's better. [break] ...spiritual world, material world, and so on, so on. Planetary..., succession of the planetary systems, everything. A building like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> That would be a separate building from the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are acquiring 350 acres of land for life for constructing a small township...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I think we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to attract people from all the world to see the planetarium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Is this near the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Planetarium name, actually it will be temple. But all round, things will be... Anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I know before the idea was to have it inside the main temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> As you walked up the outside of the, or the inside of the main temple, inside that dome, they would have it on the walls. But that would... That original plan was to have it inside the main temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You take all details, inside, outside. That will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Can you take inside? Is it allowed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Yes, I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... <span class="Italic">(japa)</span> And you prove that sun planet is first. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I was going to inquire about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The order, Sunday, Monday, whether it has to do anything with the distance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Distance, whatever it may be. But the sun is first, then moon, then Mars, then Jupiter, then like that. One after another. Otherwise, why Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> That means the distance, then, from the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Sun is first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> the moon is situated 1,600,000 miles away up to the sun. Upper. So according to their calculation, 93,000,000 miles, sun is situated from the earth. And if the moon is plus 1,600,000 then it becomes 15,000,000 miles. So 15,000,000 miles it takes about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ninety-five million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ninety-five million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. That. Ninety five millions. It takes at least seven...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seven months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven months, to the speed they are going, 18,000 miles per hour. So how they have gone in four days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> According to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have brought some sand. Such a brilliant planet which is illuminating the whole universe and they brought sand. All bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They've studied this very carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> According to the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> the sun is also 93,000,000 miles away from the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is we shall see later on. It is about. The whole diameter is 4 billions. And sun is situated almost in the middle. It is my firm conviction that they did not go to the moon. Neither they'll be able to go to the Mars as they have planned it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But their scientists would be mad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are mad already, they're talking all nonsense. Already they're mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're studying all the rocks from the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascals. What they will get? They studied the rock. And they have found one crack in the whole moon planet, and there's no living being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually the rocks are being distributed all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> For analysis. Little portion of the rock that they have brought from different stratas(?), they have distributed all over the world. And the report is coming that a portion of the elements (indistinct), so from there they calculate how old the moon is. It's about the same age as the earth, about 4.5 million years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say similar rocks are available here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they bother about bringing rock from there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> To investigate more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is investigation? Simply bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Similar rocks are available here, because the same rock was taken from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the rock is the same, so why not living beings there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They claim there is no atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if the atmosphere is different, the rock must be different. The sun must be different. The atmosphere is different, but the rock sand is the same? They have to believe that? Everything should be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Some of the rocks can be similar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similar, then atmosphere cannot be dissimilar. It is common sense. And this is also bogus, that such a brilliant illuminating planet, it is full of rocks and sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is so brilliant that it is illuminating the whole universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say the moon is a reflection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. Why reflection not come in our Sahara desert? Why you don't see such reflection in the Sahara desert so that the whole world may be illuminated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is also going to be very critical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This moon is farther away than the sun. That brings a whole new concept that poses some problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In speaking (at) colleges and universities. The other day when you spoke there, we were not speaking about astronomy, you were speaking of the origin of life, and these people, outsiders, they already had the concept to raise up that question. So without any connection they brought up. So the question was, "Whatever you present is very nice, fine, but what about the moon? Do you believe that the moon is farther away than the sun?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have already...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, they already studied, they are ready to ask those things, and they say, "Just give me an answer, yes or no."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They asked you? They asked you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what did you answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We said yes, but our explanation was much (indistinct) in the sense that we said you have to study this more carefully, but we tried to remark the concept that now we are conditioned to believe certain things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, how they heard that we are believing in this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And sometimes devotees go around the colleges and sometimes they say, "What you are doing is all wrong, the moon is far away." So I think this is spread all over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we had one explanation saying that now, the way we percept knowledge, though we understand things, there is also a conditioning behind it. So actually this is a fact, but in Mathematics, if we change the axiom, then we have a whole new understanding, it's almost completely upside down, but still we can interpret the result. It is just like a simple jumble(?), while Nils Bohr, studying the structure of the atom. Now he had a mathematical equation to fit the phenomena of this atom, and actually you can perfectly describe this phenomena by this equation, but, now, at morning times, this quantum mechanics, it turns out whatever he did was completely wrong, but it can be described completely, perfectly well as his model, as is our present understanding. But now his theories (indistinct), he could explain things on his own, but still it's completely wrong. So similarly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are right. They may present the wrong thing, but still they are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their proposition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is possible, but that's why we're claiming that. They agree that because not only there is several facts in science, that one should be (indistinct) this is true, then suddenly by some new discoveries came out all wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So we are discussing about our limitations of our so-called knowledge-finding technique. So we said, "One has to be a little open-minded and discuss these things..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does they say about that <span class="Italic">disi, astralogic kalokyam</span> (Hindi) ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And in this connection we actually wanted to also study Bhaktisiddhānta Prabhupāda's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sūrya-siddhānta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But where is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Pradyumna told me that it's available in Bengali, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is available, get it. (indistinct) He was one of the authorities about sun movements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I heard that it will be very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) He got this <span class="Italic">Sūrya-siddhānta,</span> Siddhānta Sarasvatī. He was very expert astrologer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So we were thinking that there must be some more information there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) There are (in) Calcutta many... Some of them still, living or dead I do not know. But in India, in Benares you'll find many astrologers. You said in your book that the sun is the nearest planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, I didn't say that. We actually took the concept of the... I wasn't talking much there, saying that there is one star, the sun is the nearest star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nearest star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means near star, nearest, which relationship, with the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> With the other stars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> With the other stars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other stars? Nearest means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> To the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To the earth. So they are... We are speaking the same thing. The sun is the nearest, then moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But they don't care if the moon is a star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, moon star is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī.</span> It is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Moon is one of the stars, but brilliant star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> How many brilliant stars are there in this Universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">. Aśeṣa.</span> We cannot count.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The description is also that there is only one star in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The description is that there is only one star in this universe. One star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One star?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, only one star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I'm sorry, one sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> One sun in this universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is one universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So actually what they call solar system, science doesn't call it one universe. The concept of universe is very vast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not vast. Our concept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, our conception is solar system, actually. The solar system is one universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Solar? There is no solar system. The ninth, I mean planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Solar system, what they mean, the science, the sun, and these planets that we know, consists of, comprises our <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> universe, concept of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the (indistinct) is a big affair, the sun is one of the important planets. Not only the sun, moon, Mars, Jupiter, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually as astronomy and (indistinct) are especially astronomy is one of the most unscientific branch of study, knowledge is concerned. It's very, very little known. The way that... The techniques that they use, are very difficult to rely on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So their Astronomical calculation, the sun is fixed up, that is also wrong. The sun is not fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, Your Divine Grace, you wrote me a letter saying about the universe is just like an inverted tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">ūrdhva-mūlam adhah-śākham</span> [Bg. 15.1]<span class="Italic">, Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And the tree, and the leaves, and the fruits and flowers are the planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ūrdhva-mūlam, Gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">ūrdhva-mūlam adhah-śākham.</span> The pole-star in the... And we see at night everything is moving. As a bunch it is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Does that means all the planets are fixed in relationship to each other as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Just like a tree. Tree is fixed up, as a whole tree is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because we see practically that the moon also moves, across the sky. Just like the sun does. So the sun has an orbit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun is also... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And the moon has an orbit also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ. Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ.</span> Unlimited temperature. Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Does the moon have an orbit also then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, every (indistinct). It is described as a chariot moving. Something, challenge must be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think that when we try to explain to them that the sun is drawn by a chariot, then... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The (indistinct) sun is God. He's one of the gods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Won't they just take this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) He's a person, sun-god. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> a person. That is his planet. He is the predominating Deity. And similarly moon. And the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they are coming from these two planets. As it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, vivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave...</span> Ikṣvāku is the <span class="Italic">sūrya-vaṁśa,</span> the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> family coming from the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we're taking this from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> Won't they just think that this is myth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) is myth? Who believes you? If you don't believe me, I don't believe you. Finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So we should present our side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our business. If you don't believe me I don't believe you. Finished business. You have got your authority, I've got my authority. Why shall I...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually we have authority and they have no authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your age? You are all scientists within 200 years. And our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is written 5,000 years ago. Why shall I accept yours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So no matter what they say we should present it at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have become all scientists, and everything within 200 years. What is the age of your European, Western civilization? It cannot go more than 3,000 years? Our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is written 5,000 years ago. And before that, Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, "I have heard like this." That's all. Millions and millions (of years ago)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You were saying that everything they say is wrong, and that is our position. We take that position, that everything they say is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because they are imperfect, they are speculating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the value of your speculation? If you are on the wrong platform, then what is the value of your speculation? You have got imperfect senses, you cheat, with the microscope or binocular, but it is manufactured by you. How it is perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is one of our reasonings, that the senses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are born imperfect, and you are manufacturing some measuring... So that is also imperfect. And you are depending by seeing through the binocular. How it is perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They've convinced us that these machines are accurate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is accurate? It is manufactured by you. You are a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But some things they say, like the rays...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, they may say, but first of all, what is the position of the conditioned soul? Four defects. You must commit mistakes, you must be illusioned, his senses are imperfect, and he's a cheater. These are the four defects of conditioned souls. So how the conditioned soul can give perfect knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is our conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The position of conditioned soul is that he must commit mistake, and he's illusioned, and his senses are imperfect, and he wants to cheat. Everyone speaks something. You know that he has no perfect knowledge in the subject matter, still he wants to speak something. That means he wants to cheat. This is going on. And then after some years somebody says, "No, it was not correct." That means he cheated. The former scientists or philosophers cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Why ask?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He has no perfect knowledge and he proposed something and now it is incorrect. And the man who is correcting, he's also a cheater. This is going on, this is their <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. One cheater, another cheater, another cheater. So why shall I believe the cheaters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They've convinced us by their machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That machine means, their machine. Again you are bringing the same argument. What is value of machine? The machine is made by a cheater. Imperfect senses, how it is perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But some machines work, though, like the radio, the TV...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Work to some extent, that much credit you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, to some extent that is also you're saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To some extent is, everyone accepts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just amplifies the cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. To some extent they are correct, that's all. So far they say, "I can see 2 feet or 10 feet." That's all. So how can I say I can see the whole sky? That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually that is also the fundamental mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In our attempt to gain knowledge, that we try to expand our own limited experience to something which is beyond my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beyond my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Doctor Frog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Doctor Frog, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imagining. "It may be like this. It may be like that." That is not knowledge. Doctor Frog is thinking of Atlantic ocean. He is within three feet of water. And how he can think of Atlantic Ocean? He may think, "It may be four feet, or five feet, or ten feet," and as soon as says 20 feet, he bursts. He's finished. Now you are finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But they are so many... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, that's a good point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But they cheated when they said they went to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they're cheaters, those who have got imperfect senses, they're all cheaters. If they say something, "Definitely this is like this," that is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But how can so many cheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many cheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Together. Together they all cheat, they all say they went to the moon. One thousand scientists, all together in one room? They all say, "We agree, this, they went to the moon, here's the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say that if we can prove that the moon is beyond sun, then all these cheaters will be (indistinct), by one stroke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's a great cheating effort, then. Must be a very great effort that they cheated everybody like this. Because so many scientists were fooled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many are... Because they're speculating. No valid knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> It seems that since they have imperfect senses, they're unable to perceive...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is impossible to say anything scientifically. So-called scientifically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> So they cannot perceive that there is somebody with perfect senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> They deny that there is someone with perfect senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they may, but we have got. Our knowledge is <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> That Kṛṣṇa says, whatever He says is all right. Kṛṣṇa is not common man, <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's not man at all He's Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Abhijñaḥ.</span> Experience in everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We agree that we have more limited senses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a scientist, he knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Scientists also, when we talk together...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They know that they're talking nonsense, but they still want to cheat, to get their salary, that's all. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they know, we can cheat these rascals, government. They are all rascals, we can simply talk in some bombastic words (speaks gibberish). They'll believe it. This is going on. All imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they don't produce some new theory, or some new discovery...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they prove their own foolishness. Why do you produce new theory? If there is perfect knowledge? That proves their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's also called intellectual exercise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mental speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Manorathena. Asati dhāvato bahiḥ.</span> Mental speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> It's all based on that. Because if you don't speculate mentally, you don't get a degree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's another thing. A fool is accepted by another fool. That is another thing. They're getting Nobel Prize and so on and so on. That is different thing. Fool's paradise. All of them are fools. And they have created their own paradise. Do you know that story? That one was drinking, so his friend said, "Oh, you are drinking, you'll go to hell." "No, why? My father drinks." "Well, he'll also go to hell." "Oh, by brother drinks." "So he'll also go to hell." "My brother..." In this way, the whole list was (indistinct). Then he said, everyone will go to hell. Then where is hell? It is paradise! If father is going, then mother is going, then I am going, then brother is going, then where is hell?" It is like that. They're all fools, then where is fool? Everyone is intelligent. That is (indistinct). There's no question of fool. If everyone, all of us are fool, then where is the question of intelligent? "Hey, we are intelligent." (indistinct) This is their conclusion. We can give credit to something, just like I can see up to this wall. But if I say, "Now I am seeing beyond this world, everything, the forest and everything, I know everything." That is going on. Cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's... Goes a little too far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Beyond one's limit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go, you have got... You have seen... Go to all the planets. Where can you go? Why you make attempt for sending... (indistinct). At night we see millions of planet. Go there. This is material, there is no question of spiritual world. Go there. If you've got any machine. Why you attempt? Go, as you go from here to London, go there. We can see there is... Why there is attempt? That means your instrument is also insufficient. And you are very proud of your having instrument. Where is that instrument, go with that instrument. Imperfect. Everything is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Two problems in man's history is this: one is this astronomical problem and the second is the origin of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. And we have to... Touching (?) these three worlds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So my feeling is that in about fifty years something is going to be settled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) It's already settled. They should accept the (indistinct). It's already settled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Especially about this origin of life business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also settled. Everything is settled. But these rascals must admit. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's settled in the sense that even the scientist will come around that, "Oh, yes, what we taught was wrong."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we want. They have become unnecessary authorities and misleading people. That we want to expose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So in a sense it is good that they do research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. We are giving them knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are after knowledge, they should accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There is one, some sort of a mental satisfaction. When we work something we thought that by doing this I'll be able to come to a conclusion. But by the same research, by the same result, I found that what I thought was wrong, so from that, that satisfaction is there, so that must be true. Something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is one, that Sukla, he is also favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, he's a very nice man. I never saw any Indian like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He's favorable, but he won't come to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter. But he has got sympathy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, he's very nice, sympathetic. But he didn't come to help us at all. And we approached him for life member, he said he would, but then he never did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Slow... He'll come around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The another medical man, he's also working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Medical man, he's very favorable. He comes every day to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he's a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He's moving in. He's going to take up a house here. He's very convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to give us some land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India we have been offered so many land. But we have no men (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I also got a letter from Manipur, that Life Member, Kulavida Singh, he was concerned that the young people are now giving up the religious thought, so he wanted to establish some sort of school...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That (indistinct) is made by Vivekananda, <span class="Italic">yato mata tato patha,</span> (?) very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah. So as soon as... They wanted to start an ISKCON branch, and he was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think it will not be difficult. Manipur is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It will be very easy, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Vaiṣṇava. So if they understand, that will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> All the, even the government participates so they wrote me a letter saying that they can give us nice land, plot, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Now that Govindajī's temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Govindajī's temple is taken over by the government, so I talked to, I wrote a letter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government, they cannot manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are not managing properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot. As soon as anything goes to state especially in India, goes to the government track(?), it is spoiled. Government means all thieves and rogues. How they'll manage? They'll simply swallow whatever they get. Government means... They cannot manage, they are not devotees. It should be in the hands of the devotees. So (indistinct), the paid man, they want some money, that's all. How they can manage temple? It is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It becomes a political problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It becomes involved in politics. So that... Nothing to do with the worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government should give to the hands of the devotee, we are recognized devotees, ISKCON. If they want, really management. We are managing, so many centers, on account of devotees. It is not possible to manage all these things by paid men. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll never... They'll not... This movement can be pushed on vigorously so long we are devotees, otherwise it will be finished. It cannot be conducted by any outsiders. No. Only the devotees. That is the secret.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You cannot pay a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You cannot buy a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You can buy someone to sweep the floor, but you cannot buy a preacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible. So so long we remain devotees, our movement will go, without any check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Devotees should take over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, that is... That is good for the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If devotees take up the whole world for management, then everyone will be happy. It is no doubt it. Kṛṣṇa wants that. He wanted the Pāṇḍavas should be in charge of the government. Therefore He took part in the fighting. "Yes, you should be the... All the Kauravas should be killed, and Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira installed." That is the <span class="Italic">dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya. Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> He wants everything goes very smoothly and people become God conscious. So their life be successful. That is Kṛṣṇa's plan. That, "These rascal misleading and therefore... the (indistinct) the human life has been spoiled." Therefore I was talking about the "What is the meaning of the independence, (indistinct)?" ? The life is spoiled. And they will spoil their life and become next life a dog, and this big, big building, with stair, that's all. What the big buildings will do benefit to these people who is going to be a dog next life? Taking as a theory, that those who have constructed this big, big building and next life they're going to be a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they don't know that next life they're going to be a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difficulty. They do not know it. Therefore <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> It is same thing (indistinct). The life is meant for spiritual realization. They are not (indistinct) chance. They're going to become dog, and they think that, "Now we have got this big building, that is success."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That awakening of their understanding is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Otherwise, if they know that it's going to be like that then they won't do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they dismiss, "No, we don't believe in the next life." And they're so degraded even for argument's sake, "What is the wrong if I become dog?" They say, university students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They say that, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "What is the wrong if I become a dog?" The same thing. Hell. Everyone is going to hell. So what is wrong? The same philosophy, if father is going, mother is going, brother is going, I am going, then where is hell?" That's all. We shall go there all together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Will this movement take over the world, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least you keep one idea. There is possibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I think it will be very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is possible. If we become serious and sincere, then it will go on, undoubtedly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> See how big it grew just in ten years. Today is our anniversary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Our ten year anniversary today. So in ten years we have gotten so big, by geometric progression in 20 years how big will we be? Thousands and thousands of people, chanting and dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is chance. Simply by chanting you can attract so many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, I think so. They're coming already. You chanted and so many people came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Already in the, your English vocabulary, in America, actually they use many Sanskrit vocabularies now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they believe that (indistinct) is the chairman of religion at Emery University, he told me that in about thirty years or so this, our movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're giving back toward meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can learn so many... Sanskrit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, yes. Our students to pick up some Sanskrit words. <span class="Italic">Ātmā, jīva,</span> like that. He was telling me that in about thirty or forty years our ISKCON, our movement will have a great impact in the social life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are giving all, all round enlightenment. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is full of information from all standpoint. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are now in such a downtrodden position, the whole human... He must accept. There is... The civilization is doomed. (pause) What do they explain about so many varieties of life? How do they come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They call by mutation. It's called mutation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mutation is... They say DNA molecule is the... called master molecule. But somehow during the course of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somehow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Somehow. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they're finished. As soon as they "Somehow," it is not science. It is rascaldom. Then it is useless. "Somehow," "Maybe," "Perhaps." (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Somehow there is a mistake in the... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Everything is mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who is making the mistake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to hear this thing: "Somehow they have made a mistake."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually it is very controversial. This... I read an article from the university of Berkeley, Berkeley and some other western campuses, saying that now the theory of this mutation by which the different species are formed is very controversial at this time. Because of the knowledge in our molecular biology, now what they have thought that this mutation is the cause of this variegatedness is a misnomer, being complete mistaken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All mistaken. Where is the difference, then how do you experiment in the biological class by dissecting animal body? What is the difference in the composition of social construction, I er, bodily construction. You have to suffer. That's why I have said, there must be (indistinct). The same principle is there. Otherwise how the mosquito fly like this and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They can make a mosquito but they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they cannot make mosquito. They can make 747.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They can make a sample like mosquito.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... They cannot, they cannot. That is my challenge. That first of all you bring life from the egg. You prepare a egg composition, and put it in the incubator and let some living entity come out. So can they do it? So why they will speak all nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They admit they can't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are rascal. What they cannot do, they're speaking lots of and getting Nobel prize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They say how in the future they can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You said the chicken can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But they cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Therefore a chicken, he is greater than you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Chicken can do. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. The very best way to... I want to use that as an example next time when we preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But a chicken is better than you. Don't talk nonsense. (laughter) Chicken is already doing in his way. You'll see he's laying down, chemical egg, and fermenting, and within week come. So he's better than you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They'll say that we can also do that, we can also produce child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? You can, but you, rascal, you've never done it, simply speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> No, I mean, they can produce children also by sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not your laboratory children. That is God's children. That is another thing. That is not your laboratory children. You want to produce children in laboratory? Then do that. That is our challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But this, one of our arguments now, we argue that these molecules that (indistinct) for example DNA, even if they make it, still it just... It means it's a molecule. It is not going to function normally, as we find in a living cell, in a living body. So this has nothing to do with the life processes. The molecules they make, they may do so many reactions, but still there is a fundamental difference in the living body and this simple, that... To determine that it's never possible to create life in the test tube. The have timetables, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in about fifty years, that's about the turn of the century, that about 2001 we are going to make such and such bodies and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So many strange things. They even said it that this, we have these five fingers, they said this isn't enough, so we must make six, so the six...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in this way they're cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Our brain is a little too small, so we want to do it a little bigger, so that we can think more and utilize more ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is brain? There is no question. That story, that potter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, the one that was dreaming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah. You know the potter's story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There was a potter and he had one or two pots, and he started to think, he was dreaming, "Oh, now I've got one or two pots. When I sell these pots then I'll make so much money. Then I'll make some more pots, then I'll make more money, like this. Then when I got some, enough money I'll get a wife, and I'll have a family, like this, and I'll have a nice house." In this way he was carried away with his dreaming and he was thinking, "If my wife doesn't do what I say, I'll kick her like this." And he kicked out, smashed all his pots. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the two, three pots he had were broken. Then he "Ohhh."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is called to make castles in the air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually it is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> We want to try make a film to prove this point that life comes from life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We can do that with film?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We can show it to colleges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> We wanted to work with Svarūpa Dāmodara and the other scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> ...in collaboration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it, do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Because their book, subject matter of the book is directly along those lines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say from chemicals, but if you prove that chemicals also come from life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They got some experiments that we want to do, on purely scientific level...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do it, it is a fact. You can do it, you'll be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, there are some experiments that we can do. They have been doing some experiments last three or four months to supplement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you say, in the history these are two problems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh yeah, these are the greatest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have trust these two points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Once these two points are solved, then the knowledge will be very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Everything will be very harmonious and come to a common conclusion. But so long as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are giving the solution, let them take it. This is our greatest contribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> The problem is they believe what they see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Believe or not believe, we shall have to give the people by books, by knowledge, by film.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if somehow or other that sun-moon thing can be proved, then they'll all be finished, completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will not be finished because some rascals, fools will remain to support it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's always like that, just like in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> there was two, demons and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is his world of duality. You cannot have all support on your side. It isn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, we always expect opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We must be ready for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) just like we're opposing their theory. They are not absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Science, science also, Prabhupāda, changing the subject level, science also comes to the conclusion that the stars and this universe have..., they die out and then they produce new ones, just like life cycle of the living body. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So in fact, one of the remarks of a scientist, Nobel laureate actually, in Harvard, Mādhava told me he was in American Association for the Advancement of Science. This professor is a professor in biology in Harvard, Boston. His answer was that, "In order to have man in this planet, the stars have to die." That means we come from the stars. The particles, from the stars, then the main involved from those molecules, that star, that come from the stars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do something. I can give you the idea. But it is fact. What ideas I am giving, that's a fact. Now it is up to you to put it (into) so-called scientifics. He'll... In future millions of years after it will create one living entity in the laboratory, so he's taking all the credit, and God is creating millions and millions already, He has no credit. You'll see their intelligence. What the people will gain even if you manufacture one life in the laboratory? So what is the gain? Why you are spending so much money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They want to become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God becoming is far away. First of all, make some living entity. But even if you do it, then what is your credit? Why you want to take so much great credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's called false prestige.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, how nonsense they are, misleading people, making them atheist, Godless. Great dangerous, the so-called scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So that mentality has to be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if even two, three, points we can prove that they're all rascals, then they will change. Simply cheating people and take high salary. This is common sense. Suppose in the laboratory you make one living being. So what is credit to them? The living entities are coming, many millions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee: (2):</span> You gave the story about the dog...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...barking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> And the man he is imitating the dog barking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he'll sell ticket. That "I shall bark like the dog." And people will come, "Oh, let us see." This is going on. What is the credit to bark like a dog? There are so many dogs barking, but people are so fool they'll go and purchase the ticket, "How this man barks like a dog." This is cheating. That is the qualification of conditioned soul, he can very scientifically cheat. This is cheating, "I can bark like dog."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Aren't we going a little too far. The scientist says-personally I also feel that they are not all that bad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They're badly trained up. Not all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There are many good things that they have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we already admitted. That I can see ten feet, let me credit, take credit for that. But why shall I say, "I can see the whole universe." What is this nonsense? Speak the truth. "Now we have manufactured machine, and this, I have calculation that..." All talking nonsense. I say it is not possible for you to see beyond ten feet. Why you are claiming that you can see the whole sky? That is our protest. You can see ten feet, take that credit, that much. If somebody manufactures the electric lamp, all right. Take this. But if he says, "I can manufacture the sun." Then he is to be beaten with shoes. Talking nonsense. You take this credit, that you have manufactured light in electric bulb, that's all right. But why you claim that, "I can manufacture the sun"? That is their claim, defying God. Because we are explaining God consciousness, therefore we have protest. Otherwise let them move(?), all nonsense (indistinct). But we cannot tolerate when they challenge God. We must (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This year also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, just like their 200 year anniversary, similarly in American Chemical Society this is 100th year celebration. There was a big meeting in New York just few months ago, international meeting, celebrating the 100th year of the American Chemical Society. So I was planning to go there but I didn't go. But they have a moving model of what science has achieved in the last 200 years. And also predictions for what will happen in the future. And one of the Nobel laureates-Fowling is his name, from California-he predicted that, specifically in the chemical community, people take him as some sort of, their leader, so whatever he says, they believe that it's going to happen. So he believes that in the next coming 100 years there will be more knowledge on this life matter, and then people will be happier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is mis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Selling plastic world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plastic world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mostly synthetic, in a synthetic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manufacture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Plastic materials will be predominant, and we will have more frontiers of knowledge especially in the biology, molecular biology. So they are also pessimist that in such and such years we're going to make short of these coal deposits and all these energy supplies, all these different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) will work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But he is not, he's optimistic. He said they will find new sources on the nuclear energy, solar energy and all these predictions. But the point there is that these people, they believe in what he says, because he has Nobel laureate (indistinct), and he's respected by... He's very old about seventy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what he is proposing? It's nothing new.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He's giving some thought, to those people who are worried, "Don't worry about life, it's going to be all nice." And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not worried, and even if we, one is worried, he'll be finished by that time. So all worries will be gone. Moreover, after death there will be no worries. (pause) Prove that everything is being done by God, that we want. Half past five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Almost twenty-five to. Twenty-seven minutes to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-seven minutes? No, no. It is thirty minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Twenty-seven minutes to six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is made by science. This watch is a product of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Science means craftsman, that's all. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Mistri.</span> We say <span class="Italic">mistri.</span> (laughter) You know, in our Indian language? <span class="Italic">Mistri?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mystery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mistri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any craftsman, we say <span class="Italic">mistri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">mistri</span> has no position. Maybe correct. In our Vedic civilization a learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is honored, not a <span class="Italic">mistri.</span> Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> is not expected to manufacture a watch, but he's more honored than one who is actually... This modern age is: if he manufactures watch he is honored. Not the learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is Kali-yuga. That is Kali-yuga. They do not know whom to honor. That is the Kali-yuga going on. You kill so many souls, and if you have a great big skyscraper building, then you are successful. And those who constructed the skyscraper, they are going to become dog, never mind, the skyscraper building is there. That's all. That is success. This is modern civilization. After they constructed the skyscraper building all the <span class="Italic">mistris</span> are going to hell, that doesn't matter. The building is there. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is civilization. Long ago in 1917 perhaps, in our college, we saw one magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> St. Xavier's College?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Scottish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, Scottish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scottish Churches College. So one American, Scientific American, we have contribute(?). So there the picture was that one skyscraper building is constructed and so many men are working, carrying the beams and so on. So there was-I remember still-that all, some material construction, so many living entities they are being sacrificed(?). I do not know how the Scientific American gave this picture, I still remember. Actually that is a fact. This human being would have been released from this materialistic way of life, back to home, back to... No, instead of giving them the chance, they are engaged in constructing huge skyscraper building. They're spoiled. So it is little difficult to understand our philosophy. And Prahlāda Mahārāja said,<span class="Italic"> tat-prayāso na kartavyo yata āyur-vyayaḥ param. Tat-prayāso na kartavyaḥ.</span> This kind of activity should stop. It is simply wasting the valuable life. But they do not know how they're wasting. They're in such an ignorance. They are thinking that these people, crazy people, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, are wasting time, they're thinking like that. They do not know what is the value of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's a fact that the material opulence is actually a hindrance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām, vyavasāyātmikā buddhi...</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 2.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Their life will be spoiled. And when they are tired, give them sex, and wine, and meat, and gambling, they are satisfied. Again as soon as they get little energy, again begin another skyscraper. You got this human life for solving all the problem. He is not given the chance. He's engaged otherwise, his life is spoiled. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You economically prove that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is simple and inexpensive life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">jaya,</span> mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Food, diet, living condition, healthy, hygienic, everything. You prove that this is the best way of life. That's a fact. From all sides, prove that Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is essential for the human society, to make them happy in this and the next life. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda? Today I want to discuss about the manifestation of the matter from <span class="Italic">pradhāna.</span> Now Lord Kapiladeva describes that <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> is the undifferentiated sum total of material elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahat-tattva?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, <span class="Italic">pradhāna.</span> Then from <span class="Italic">pradhāna,</span> by the action of time this <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is generated. Now we were a little confused about that. He said by the impregnation of the Lord's internal potency there is <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya,</span> is produced within <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> and this <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya</span> is self-effulgent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's effulgent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Hiraṇmaya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Effulgent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, effulgent, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Now our point is whether this <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya...</span> In the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> the relationship between these two and <span class="Italic">pradhāna,</span> how does that relate each other? It's not very clear in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> you're not very clear, this point. It said from <span class="Italic">pradhāna,</span> by the impregnation with the Lord's internal potency, the <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya</span> is produced. That's actually the beginning of the injection of <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> within these material modes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is little complicated. So is it not clear from the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is little difficult to understand the phenomenal descriptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span>? <span class="Italic">Nityānanda-tattva?</span> You can read it, you'll get some clue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We also get some clue from First Canto, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> in the <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> incarnations, where it explains about <span class="Italic">tattva.</span> But there is a difference between... Now our understanding is this: <span class="Italic">pradhāna,</span> both <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> and <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva, </span>they are eternal, though they are material manifestations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, eternal in the sense that it's different from <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> Now <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is, when it is completely manifested...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prakṛti, pradhāna, puruṣa,</span> these things are little complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we wanted to clarify this, because this is the nice thing that we can show that matter comes from life. This is the source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sa īkṣata, sa asṛjata,</span> by the glance of Mahā-Viṣṇu... <span class="Italic">Eko nārāyaṇa āsīt.</span> In the beginning, Nārāyaṇa was there. There was no Lord Śiva, no neither Brahmā. This <span class="Italic">mantra</span> was there. So originally by the glance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> By the glance of Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can prove it that how by the sunshine everything is growing. How it is? Your molecule and so on, so on... You can describe. Actually, from the sunshine the trees are growing, leaves are coming. As soon as there is no sunshine, immediately they fall down, the leaves, and the tree becomes without any leaves. How this happens? The same process. The sunshine produces so many things. Similarly, by the glance of the Supreme, the material nature becomes agitated and the three <span class="Italic">guṇas</span> become manifest. In this way these are described there. The same process. How from the sunshine the leaves are coming out, what are the molecular changes, if you can study the same process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> (indistinct) ...with this <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya,</span> the relationship between <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> and the <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya</span> is clear, then I think we can have some idea. So we are little confused on this very point. It is also said <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> is the twenty-four elements that doesn't contain time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pradhāna</span> is the ingredient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, it is the sum total of the unmanifested material elements. Now from <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> actually <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is manifested. In <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> there is a basic difference that there is some, already some manifestations in <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Categories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Total material elements, <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Is that differentiated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahat-tattva</span> is differentiated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Different categories?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The time element is there in <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> so it is already twenty-five elements there including time. At this stage also, the impregnation of the Lord's internal potency means that the <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> are already impregnated here from <span class="Italic">pradhāna.</span> So here the living entities are in pure goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The living entities are always in pure goodness. This material covering is separated. The living entities can be freed from material covering at any moment. Just like water and oil, it is always separated, it does not mix. The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> also says <span class="Italic">asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> Actually, it is not mixed, but it is covered. That covering can be taken away at any moment simply by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> I think in First Canto, that description you try to understand, you'll get.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think there is also reference in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> this <span class="Italic">hiraṇmaya,</span> because sometimes it's also called Brahman.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Or the index maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No. Chapter Three. "In this chapter the author has fully discussed the reason for the descent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, after displaying His pastimes as Lord Kṛṣṇa, thought it wise to make His advent in the form of a devotee to explain personally the transcendental mellow reciprocations of service and love between Himself and His servants, friends, parents and fiancees. According to the Vedic literature, the foremost occupational duty for humanity in this age of Kali is <span class="Italic">nāma-saṅkīrtana,</span> or congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. The incarnation for this age especially preaches this process, but only Kṛṣṇa Himself can explain the confidential loving service performed in the four principal varieties of loving affairs between the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore personally appeared, with His plenary portions, as Lord Caitanya. As stated in this chapter, only for that purpose did Lord Kṛṣṇa appear personally in Navadvīpa in the form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja has herein presented much authentic evidence from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and other scriptures to substantiate the identity of..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are reading Caitanya Mahāprabhu. About Nityānanda, see the contents? No, in the beginning. Chapter where is contents. <span class="Italic">Nityānanda-tattva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> "The Glories of Lord Nityānanda-Balarāma."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifth Chapter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> "This chapter is chiefly devoted to describing the essential nature and glories of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the absolute Personality of Godhead, and His first expansion in a form for pastimes is Śrī Balarāma. Beyond the limitation of this material world is the spiritual sky, <span class="Italic">paravyoma,</span> which has many spiritual planets, the supreme of which is called Kṛṣṇaloka. Kṛṣṇaloka, the abode of Kṛṣṇa, has three divisions, which are known as Dvārakā, Mathurā and Gokula. In that abode the Personality of Godhead expands Himself into four plenary portions-Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma, Pradyumna (the transcendental Cupid) and Aniruddha. They are known as the original quadruple forms. In Kṛṣṇaloka is a transcendental place known as Śvetadvīpa, or Vṛndāvana. Below Kṛṣṇaloka, in the spiritual sky, are the Vaikuṇṭha planets. On each Vaikuṇṭha planet a four-handed Nārāyaṇa, expanded from the first quadruple manifestation, is present. The Personality of Godhead known as Śrī Balarāma in Kṛṣṇaloka is the original Saṅkarṣaṇa (attracting Deity), and from this Saṅkarṣaṇa expands another Saṅkarṣaṇa, called Mahā-Saṅkarṣaṇa, who resides in one of the Vaikuṇṭha planets. By His internal potency, Mahā-Saṅkarṣaṇa maintains the transcendental existence of all the planets in the spiritual sky, where all the living beings are eternally liberated souls. The influence of the material energy is conspicuous there by its absence. On those planets the second quadruple manifestation is present. Outside of the Vaikuṇṭha planets is the impersonal manifestation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which is known as the Brahmaloka. On the other side of the Brahmaloka is the spiritual <span class="Italic">kāraṇa-samudra,</span> or Causal Ocean. The material energy exists on the other side of the Causal Ocean, without touching it. In the Causal Ocean is Mahā-Viṣṇu, the original <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> expansion from Saṅkarṣaṇa. This Mahā-Viṣṇu places His glance over the material energy, and by a reflection of His transcendental body He amalgamates Himself within the material elements. As the source of the material elements, the material energy is known as <span class="Italic">pradhāna,</span> and as the source of the manifestations of the material energy it is known as <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> But material nature is inert in that she has no independent power to do anything. She is empowered to make the cosmic manifestation by the glance of Mahā-Viṣṇu. Therefore the material energy is not the original cause of the material manifestation. Rather, the transcendental glance of Mahā-Viṣṇu over material nature produces that cosmic manifestation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you try to understand this, everything will be clear. Material energy has no power to create. It is this glance that makes material energy energetic. Chemical combination, that alkaline and acid, they create some agitation, effervescence, but it is done by the chemist. He mixes the two liquids and there is effervescence. It is like that. So you read that chapter carefully. You'll solve your problem. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's said in the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> when the Lord glances or impregnates, that the glancing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is spiritual. That glancing is spiritual. So matter itself cannot do anything. <span class="Italic">Aja-jala-stana, aja-jala-stana.</span> The nipples in the throat, neck. As there are some nipples, nipples useless, that is not milk-giving nipples. So nature is creating. They, generally, they say "by nature," but nature has no power. It is matter. When there is glance of Saṅkarṣaṇa or Viṣṇu, that will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In that state, when a living entity's impregnated in this state, it is also said that it is in pure goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pure goodness always, it is simply covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is not the completely manifested yet, but then it says by the contamination of pure goodness by <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra,</span> then starts material ego. From there, everything is going to manifest. So once we come to material ego then it seems clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out, <span class="Italic">puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi<br class="calibre2"/>bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān<br class="calibre2"/>kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya<br class="calibre2"/>sad-asad-yoni-janmasu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 13.22]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species." How does the contaminated ego or contaminated consciousness differ from false ego?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? That is contaminated ego, false ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we have a subdivision in the Third Canto for internal subtle senses. It is said mind, intelligence, ego and the contaminated consciousness and this ego is false ego, and another division is contaminated consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is false ego, "I am this matter, I am this body." This is false ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, but why it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ego is there, but this is false ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Then by association with the modes there is contaminated consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This false ego develops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But still in this verse on 7.26, verse 14, it says there are four internal subtle senses. Now these four senses are mind, intelligence, ego and the contaminated consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mano buddhir ahaṅkāraś<br class="calibre2"/>cittam ity antar-ātmakam<br class="calibre2"/>caturdhā lakṣyate bhedo<br class="calibre2"/>vṛttyā lakṣaṇa-rūpayā</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"The internal subtle senses are experienced as having four aspects in the shape of mind, intelligence, ego and contaminated consciousness. Distinctions between them can be made only by different functions, since they represent different characteristics." Purport: "The four internal senses or subtle senses described herein are defined by different characteristics. When pure consciousness is polluted by material contamination, and identification with the body becomes predominant, this is called false ego. Consciousness is the function of the soul, and therefore behind consciousness there is soul. When consciousness is polluted by material contamination, this is called <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān.</span> The same thing. <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-sthaḥ bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Is-this ego mentioned here-is it a false ego? That's what I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not real. Real ego is "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Is there false ego in different modes? Like false ego in the mode of ignorance, false in the mode of passion or goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So the consciousness can be contaminated according to the mode in which it's associating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">prakṛti-jān guṇān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes. So I am identifying with my body in any mode, that is false ego. But my consciousness is contaminated by a particular mode. May be passion, may be ignorance, may be goodness. So then my consciousness is contaminated. So false ego is the base of all material activities, but I may be acting in a certain mode, contaminated in a certain way. Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is what it means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Everything clear, these four internal subtle senses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> What else, you got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually consciousness is a symptom of life, so when we say contaminated consciousness, the quality of life is there, but somehow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is mixed with material modes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Originally it is goodness. Very... Pure goodness, you say. Everything in the beginning is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I give the example, just like water falling from the sky. It is crystal clear, distilled water. But as soon as touches the earth, it becomes muddy. But that muddiness can be filtered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Plus muddiness is the character of the mud, not the consciousness. And it can be cleansed, filtered out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that filtering process is devotional service. So unless the water is different from the precipitated matter, how it can be filtered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So far we are concerned, <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is clear, but the source of <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is little, ah, so we try to... We want to show this, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in our chapter on some sort of creation, creation of material manifestation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll get from Second Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Second Canto. That's that "First Step in Self-Realization" chapter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Fifth chapter, sixth chapter, two chapters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Atra sargo visargaś ca,</span> that verse, Second Canto, you find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is matter generated within a given body, like the body of a human being? While it's living, is matter generated and annihilated within that body during the time of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body is matter. Whole body is combination of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Right. But does the living entity within or the Supersoul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, within.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Does it generate matter, so say the body could get heavier or lighter because of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the living entity is there, matter is generated. Just like a tree, living entity is there, and big log, wood is generated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Like that stone. That stone is increasing it's weight, so when someone goes to see the stone he sees, ah, the stone is bigger and heavier also. So that increased material or matter that makes up the bigger size of the stone, is that matter being generated from the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> From the spirit soul. So spirit soul has power...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> Similarly, from the spirit soul everything has come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So spirit soul can create matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, from life matter is generated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not from matter life is generated. That is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> There are some people who have done measurements and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Measurement is there in the Vedic literature, <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Is it that the living entity, when he creates this matter to expand, like the stone is growing, does he manufacture this material from the etheric platform, or does he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to his desire he can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Simply by desiring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Icchā dveṣaḥ samutthena sarge yānti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> There have been some..., modern scientists have done some experiments showing that in the soil there are organisms, micro-organisms and earthworms that can produce chemicals, increasing just simply by their presence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have given that example, already he has mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Pasteur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this lemon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> A lemon tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A lemon tree is producing chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Some people would say the lemon tree was simply taking food and rearranging it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But the tree is the source, but everything is there in the earth. But God's creation is so nice that through the tree the chemical is coming. The chemical is there in the earth, but the seed of the lemon tree, when it grows, it extracts the particular type of chemical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> We were wondering then if also it could produce matter, instead of taking from the earth and rearranging it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, earth is the source of everything. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī,</span> you get from... Actually you are getting all chemicals from the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So they are already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Created by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The driver(?) is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He's trying to mention an experiment in science, there's a man called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your duty, mention...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He tries to show that the living system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if we can see practically different seeds are exacting different color, different flavor, different chemicals. Everything is coming from the earth, <span class="Italic">sarva-kāma-dughā mahī,</span> everything is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So the plant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply outside arrangement, how to take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So in other words the tree or the plant in agriculture takes the chemicals from the soil...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The seed, as soon as come in touch with the earth, the seed exacts particular chemical and everything from there. This is the arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So that spirit soul in the seed, he is not creating anything; he is taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit soul, according to his <span class="Italic">karma,</span> takes shelter of the situation. But the seed, the chemical composition, exacts the desired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> All Kṛṣṇa's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Can the seed do that without the spirit soul being present within the seed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Can the seed extract anything without the spirit soul being present there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Seed is instrumental. Just like you have to do something, you require an instrument. Actually, according to the desire of the living entity, he's given instrument, <span class="Italic">bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">]. Yantra.</span> You require something, you require a particular <span class="Italic">yantra</span> or machine. So seed is practically the machine, and the living entity is using it to satisfy his desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So that growth of matter, that's the matter is coming from outside, and the spirit soul is simply taking it and expanding his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Is earth still being manifested from ether? Like the description in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> is from sound and then through different elements finally down to earth. Is that still happening today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every, always happening. Nature's law is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Yes. So what I was wondering, is like earth still being manifested in living bodies from sound and so on, like the chemists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The process is going on. I've described. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So the spirit soul is in the seed, and the seed interacts with the other chemicals to make growth. So if the chemicals are not there in the earth, then that seed cannot make those chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, chemical is there in the earth. According to the seed it is exacted. Just like a chemist will analyze or they separate the ingredient, so much this percentage, so much that percentage, so much that. Everything is there. Similarly within the earth, everything is there. The seed is the instrument and the living entity is the exactor-what is that? Exactor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. He's executor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> He takes, utilizes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Utilizer. <span class="Italic">Bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Extracts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Extracts from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Extracts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Suppose like now, just like this Vedic injunction against artificial fertilizers in the soil, suppose, as modern farmers are doing, they use this artificial fertilizer and the soil becomes depleted in minerals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means artificial is the same principle. You are living entity; by artificial fertilizer you are exacting something from the earth, the same principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Now suppose we take so many chemicals from the earth and they may become a little depleted. Can those chemicals be replaced by the earth itself as the ongoing process of nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is coming from the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is..., Sadāpūta has an interesting point in science itself, that somebody tried to show that in the living body, when life is within matter, the ah, it doesn't follow the conservation of matter. Science, one of the basic principles of science is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. All the living conditions are there in the matter, provided there is the living being, that's all. Just like a dead body, it is not that the living condition is finished, no. The living conditions are there. That particular soul has left that body. But the dead body is also full of ingredients of living condition. So many germs are coming out when the body is decomposed. You say decomposition, but even in that decomposed condition there is living condition. So the living conditions are already there, matter in any form. So how these rascals say there is no life in the moon planet? That is not possible. The living conditions are always there in the matter. This is the example. Now, a decomposed body, the living being has left, now it is dead matter, but still, the living beings are coming out. How it is? That means matter has always the potency to give shelter to the living entity. So it is impossible that there is no living being in the moon planet. It is bogus. We cannot accept it. Any condition there is provision for the living beings. We see actually, in the earth, in the air, in the water, in the fire, these five elements. Whatever you take, these five elements in different proportions. So the living..., just like from perspiration living entities come out. It is impossible there is no living entities. That is bogus complete. You can challenge like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The living entities that they are familiar with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. <span class="Italic">Kūpa-māṇḍūkya-nyāya.</span> They knew some certain type of living entities, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they think that all the living entities would be like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their <span class="Italic">kūpa-māṇḍūkya-nyāya,</span> Dr. Frog. But the fact is, any condition of material existence, there is possibility of living entity there. <span class="Italic">Sarva-ga, sthāṇur, acalo'yaṁ sarva-ga.</span> Everywhere there is living entity. It is impossible to conclude that on other planets there is no living entity. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Is it possible to do some experiments?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You experiment, you see a dead body. It is obnoxious smelling, but living entities coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, to show that matter is generated by life, we want to do some experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is there. Every day we are experiencing, huh? Just the same seed and the living entity comes and it becomes a tree and it grows, big tree, huge body. And as soon as it is dead, the body is not increasing. This is experiment. Everything is coming from life. Kṛṣṇa says, He's the supreme life, He says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate iti matvā bhajante māṁ budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's the origin of everything, both matter and life, everything. Matter also coming from life, life is also coming from life. Therefore life is the original source of everything. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> So <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ</span> is life. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ [SB </span>1.1.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That source of everything is life and is fully conscious of everything what is happening. <span class="Italic">Anvayāt,</span> indirectly and directly, fully conscious. That is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So that matter is coming from Kṛṣṇa originally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is coming from Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Spirit soul, he has his activities and he's active and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may be inactive, but his subtle desires is active. That is creation. Matter is supplying, that is <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So he creates the situation for the matter, but he doesn't create the matter itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He wants, "I want this," and God is there, He asks material energy to supply the ingredients, and he creates his own situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Thank you very much, Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
