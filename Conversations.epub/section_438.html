<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I'm still working because I have to entertain with money. In our world you cannot do anything without money. But what may interest you is that we have several manpower who are looking for truth, for the really truth, and trying to attain it and to follow it. And for this reason, it is said to go only according the scientific organization officials, so on, we went in quite revolutionary ways. For instance, we took all biology coming from the energetic point of view which is quite different. Not with the microscope, not with chemical analysis, but with the thinking that everything is only immaterial reaction (?). And with this we achieved extraordinary result. So we have looked at the official world as completely fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Are you able to understand when he speaks? I can repeat if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I believe on this point of view. (speaks in French with Yogeśvara)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He explains that the group that he is heading up is a little bit revolutionary in the biological field. Instead of taking biology from the point of chemical, microscopic analysis, they take biology from the point of view of energetic, that is to say, everything being energy, stemming from some source, that everything is energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nice. Actually, it is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And our last official result is, of course, a scandal for the orthodox world. We did transmute matter from one to another. We achieved transmutation like alchemists in the Middle Age, you see. And a single element which is called iron, we make from it chrome which is another single element. And it is so revolutionary that we had the experimentation made completely not from our side but from official organization in France. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What he says is that the final conclusion of their research work has been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> One of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> One of their conclusions has been to be able to make one element to change into another element. They were able to take iron and transform it into chrome by chemical process, almost like alchemy, he says. And this was very startling for the scientific world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Result. Result, only with physical heat, eight hundred, and pressure, only this. No laser, no atomic energy, nothing at all. Simply by natural measures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can give you one information, that metals like bell metal. Bell metal is combination of...? What is called? Tin? Tin? What is another name of tin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Copper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, tin and copper and mercury; if you can mix, it will become gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I'm sure it is possible, from what we have seen and made. But it is not of great interest to make gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are interested. (laughter) We want gold for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Nobody is paying us. We are simply selling our books. That's all. Nobody paying us, no government, no..., that "You take so many million dollars for spreading Kṛṣṇa..." Nobody. Therefore we require some gold. So biology, what is the basic principle of biology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Do you understand his question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Le principe, c'est la vie,</span> life. And what is life? It is energy, speaking in European language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Life, what is his life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says it is energy, life is energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Whose energy? Whose energy? Wherefrom the energy comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> From very, very high up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes. It is... This matter is also energy, and life is also energy. So according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> this life, or the living being, is superior energy, and the matter is inferior energy. So this living being is combination of the superior and inferior energy. But the superior energy is not matter. It is spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And it is the... Both the energy are coming from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our study. So the living energy, the spirit soul, it has got a formation, formation, form. That is also stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that 1/10,000th part of the top of the hair. Hair, the point, hair. (Yogeśvara translates in French) 1/10,000 part of the... The exact version is <span class="Italic">keśāgra. Keśa</span> means hair, and <span class="Italic">agra</span> means the top. <span class="Italic">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]<span class="Italic">.</span> So that point, you divide into hundred, and take again one part of it, and again divide into hundred. That means you divide the top of the hair into ten thousand parts and then that one part is the magnitude of the soul, spiritual energy. That spiritual energy is within you, within me, within the ant, or within the elephant. So we are living entities. And the body is inferior energy, at the present moment. In the material world the body is covering. Just like you are covered by the coat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> No, you see, we have tried with some of our members, some of whom are very high in spiritual position, outside of this world. We have tried to look, to reach for the old truth in the very old knowledges of humanity. We have tried this with Indian knowledges. We have tried this with Chinese knowledges. We have tried this with Mexican knowledges. We have tried it everywhere. And we have found that everywhere there is, when you go deep enough, the same truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says among their members, many of them are spiritually inclined So they have investigated the ancient scriptures from China and Mexico, all over the world, and they found that if you go down far enough in the philosophy, it is the same truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, truth is for everyone-if it is truth. Truth cannot be different. Chinese truth is different from Indian truth. That cannot be. Truth is the truth, provided it is truth. You take something myth as truth-that is different thing. So the truth is that this body is formed on the basis of that spiritual spark. That is the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> For our opinion, scientific knowledges, they speak about the genetic code, and for us, the genetic code is very simple, and we have prepared a revolution, for instance, in the genetic questions in replacing the thousand of books of explanation, scientific, with a single truth, and this truth explains all the genetic code, very simple. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom the energy comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> From where it comes, our poor human knowledge cannot gain something precise about it. We must believe it-it comes from very high-but to explain it scientifically is completely foolish. That is our opinion. And further, as I said to you when looked at everywhere, if I take India, explain it coming here, that... I received it about ten or twelve years ago. That is what the Christians would speak about, a mystery, something extraordinary. I received from a holy man in India, with which I was corresponding from time to time. Without asking, I received a big book in Sanskrit. I could not understand a word about it. Well, I put it aside preciously...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> It was the Āyurvedic collection. The old Āyurvedic medicine. This was this book. And I learned about it only one year ago because a professor of Sanskrit from India had it come from India to Europe and he's... Paris, I believe. He was a professor of Sanskrit. And showed this book. And he said, "It is marvelous. You cannot find it anymore. It is the old Āyurvedic medicine." And this I had for ten years without knowing what.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are very pleased that you are accepting that the life comes... Life is energy. Now, which is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> We give it a name, energy. It is much higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is energy, exactly the name. Because we say <span class="Italic">prakṛti. Prakṛti</span> means energy, nature, nature. Just like it is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām.</span> You find out this verse. (Yogeśvara translates.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Our aim. We are looking about. The state of the world is going down since thirty years, I said. With pollution, with strengths, with power, with everything, the world is going down, going to the catastrophe. And there is only one possibility to save it. It is a question of spiritual revolution. Without a spiritual revolution, between twenty, twenty-five years, the world is finished, all the world of which people are so proud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And this we are doing everything in our power to prepare and to do what we can to prepare this spiritual revolution. It is the thing we have to do today to save the world. Without spiritual revolution, there is no possibility to save the world. It is going down definitely. For this earth, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have started this movement, spiritual revolution, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So why don't you cooperate with us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Oh, you see we are doing in our field everything we can and we are preparing to bring this special revolution. We have to bring to light all the old knowledges, the real spiritual knowledge. And this is what we are preparing. And it will take one or two years more until everything is prepared, can be shown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Some. Some of the members know it perfectly. I do not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you read that. Energy, two energies, how they are explained. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> You see some of members are... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> This is in the Seventh Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> text numbers four and five.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ<br class="calibre2"/>khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me<br class="calibre2"/>bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span>Bg. 7.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego-altogether these eight comprise My separated material energies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is material energy. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalaḥ,</span> explain that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That the material energies-earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego-these energies, they come from Kṛṣṇa. In other words, we are speaking of energy. There is an origin to the energy. We always have an experience. Just like there is sunshine here, but the sun, origin, is millions of miles away. So in the same way these energies also have origin. It's not that they are just existing without some source. And Kṛṣṇa is describing here in the Seventh Chapter-this is called Knowledge of the Absolute-how these energies are related to Him. Now, in the material world it's described that there are two energies. This is called <span class="Italic">bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā,</span> inferior energy. This will be described in the next verse. <span class="Italic">Apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām [Bg. </span>7.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now, this is describing the superior energy or the <span class="Italic">parām,</span> the <span class="Italic">parāṁ prakṛti.</span> And this is described, "Besides this inferior nature," which is this earth, air, water, fire, ether, "O Mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine which are all the living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." So this earth, air, water, fire and ether... Just like your body, it is being sustained by the soul. And as soon as the soul leaves the body, then, of course, the earth, air, water, fire and ether, it is no longer sustained in this fashion. It merges into the various elements or energies. And in this way, we can understand that the material world is made up of two energies, as my spiritual master said: the inferior energy, or this <span class="Italic">aparā-prakṛti,</span> earth, air, water, fire, ether, etc., and the superior energy, or the living force. So the point is that the life force does not come from a combination of earth, air, water, fire, ether. It is separate. That is a superior energy. And on this point we agree. Now, we have to find out what is the source of both the superior and inferior material energies, or what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is spiritual energy. That is spiritual energy. When we find out the source of these two energies, that the beginning of spiritual life, or spiritual understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And, Your Holiness, you know, some of our members know this perfectly, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and all the holy scriptures, ancient holy scriptures, and all the others too, and have studied them for years, trying to look for truth. I am not in this stage and I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But truth is there, explained. Truth is there, Kṛṣṇa. From Him, the energies are coming. He is the Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi.</span> Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, <span class="Italic">satyam.</span> Then <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> explains, <span class="Italic">paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.</span> So the Supreme Truth is there within our understanding. But people do not know it. Therefore spiritual revolution means the people should understand what is the Supreme Truth, and then mold their character and activities according to that relationship. Then that is success of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And I can say to you, we are making a very..., preparing, some of our members, a very important work, which is explanation from the medical point of view of all the genetic code which is in science something absolutely terrific, plenty, thousands of books and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What is your explanation of the genetic code?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says... Very interesting. He says one of the conclusions that they have arrived at is that despite all of your research work, despite all of your scientific studies, if you don't have a simple spirit of inquiry, you won't be able to understand the codes of life. He says the genetic codes, actually, it is a great secret, a mystery, which they are trying to prepare for general understanding, and that secret is that you must be of a simple, humble spirit in order to understand the mysteries of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> You must try to look for truth, and when you look for truth, you see very extraordinary and simple solution explaining everything for the scientific men. But the time is not right to give it to them. A little later, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> You spoke of a destruction. You said that without a spiritual revolution, there would be some type of destruction. What exactly do you think of as destruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Oh, the world will be dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> No. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we have information that the living force, or the soul, is neither born and neither it dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Ah, yes. I meant this world. Matter is the earth. Be careful. I don't mean life in general...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Now, this is the point that my spiritual master is bringing out, that the material energy is inferior, and in order to have a spiritual revolution you have to understand the superior energy which is eternal, without birth and without death. So, of course, there is no question of destruction for the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Destruction in our occidental language and practically, which is not yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Destruction in simple terms, just as we know something has a beginning and something has an end. That is destruction. So in Vedic terms that which has a beginning and has an end is called material, and that which has no beginning and no end, but is existing nonetheless, that is called spiritual or superior energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Of course. This cannot be destroyed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That cannot be destroyed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> That cannot be destroyed. It can disappear from the living people, Christian or other of this world, but not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what do you mean by spiritual revolution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> It is to see, to look, for the real truth, the simple truth. The very simple truth. And to abandon our way of life aiming only for money, power and material things, to go back to simple living and especially to living with up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Living with?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Living with higher thoughts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then higher thoughts... Is there any definition of the higher thoughts? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says humanly it is impossible to understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> We can feel it. We can believe it, but we cannot explain it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if there is explanation by a person who is not a human being, say, God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> Yes, we say God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why should you not take it? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> We'll accept. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He said if it were presented he would accept it and try to promote it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just find out this verse, Eighth Chapter, <span class="Italic">paras tasmāt tu bhāvaḥ anyaḥ avyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> Find out the index.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ:</span> "Yet there is another nature which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I am quite agree. And we do all in our center agree with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then, first of all, we have to understand what is our constitutional position. We are superior-we, living entities-we are superior energy, eternal. And after annihilation of this body, I, the spirit soul, superior energy, am not annihilated. I accept another body, material body. And there are varieties of body, 8,400,000. (Yogeśvara translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And on this point of view, when some people are going very badly, wrong with us, of course, for us it is like air, but we say, "Poor people, what about their <span class="Italic">karma?"</span> That is how we look it, "What about their <span class="Italic">karma?"</span> It is a pity for them that they do so wrong, because they will have to pay for it. That is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That "pay for it" means, he has got this chance of human body. Now he will have to accept lower grade animal body. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that at least on these points we are in agreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the real inconvenience is that I am eternal. I am now put into such condition that I have to change my body, and there is risk of getting degraded body. Therefore my problem is that-I am put into this condition, repetition of change of body-to get out of it-that is spiritual life-and transfer myself there. <span class="Italic">Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> Just like we are in this material nature. If we transfer to that spiritual nature, then there is no more this problem, getting this body, again annihilate, again get another body, again annihilate. This problem is solved. And that is spiritual life. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he says they completely accept that there is a superior energy which can be attained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore human activities should be dovetailed for going back to home, back to Godhead. That is spiritual movement. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is also their idea. This is their point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are giving this idea in practical form. Why not cooperate with us? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says first of all, so far as cooperation is concerned, he is just one man. He is the president, although he is the president, still, he is only one man, and he can only speak in terms of cooperating with the spiritual movement among the more enlightened members of his group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is required, because if the enlightened men of the society does something, others will follow. It is not that the general mass of people has to be educated. They will be automatically educated. They will follow. If the enlightened man is living in such a way that he is going to be transferred to the spiritual world, then others will follow. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> At least, there must be a class of men, ideal men, that they are preparing themselves for transferring to the spiritual world. Then people will see that "Here is the ideal man," and they will try to follow. (French) But if people see that "He is also like us. He is also drinking, he is also eating meat, and he is also having illicit sex," then where is the ideal man? Everyone is implicated with these things, sinful life. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He knows about Guru Maharaji. He says he has so many people following him. The only conclusion that we can have is that there are many, many people who are looking for spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And they took everything they can find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. People, especially in the western world, they are actually looking after some spiritual emancipation, but they think that from India... Actually, that is a fact. Therefore, any rascal comes, they go around him. But why the western people, those who are on the top of educational and social position, they try to understand what is spirit life and follow them, and place an ideal life so that others may follow. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Some of his members, some friends, were even visitors at the temples at Benares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is as a tourist, but that is not understanding of spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I don't speak of tourist. I speak of a holy man. Be careful. Not a tourist. As a man having attained very high in truth, and for this reason, and not as a tourist. He was at the time crowded like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Holy man means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The real purpose of going to holy places is to find out there the holy man and take knowledge from him. That is real going to the holy places of pilgrimage. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that his members, who have gone to India, they themselves are considered to be holy men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> And he went not there as tourist or to inquire. He went to speak, to try to speak about the truth, not about..., for questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So some of you have gone. So what truth you have seen? That is... What is the truth? What you have learned about the truth? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That we must continue to look for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is... They have not looked. Or they have not found out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> To try to reach it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are trying. They are trying, but they have not reached. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he doesn't pretend to have found it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. But then the next step is just to now find it. Here is the truth, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa. So why don't you accept this truth? If you are actually trying to find out the truth, here is the truth. It is accepted by all learned scholars and <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> of India: the Supreme Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, so why don't you study Kṛṣṇa? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that's the kind of question you would have to ask his members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can ask the members. I can talk with the members. If they are actually trying to find out the truth, then I can present them the truth. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that perhaps his members won't think that they need this kind of truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the searching after truth? It is hypocrisy. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Maybe they already know the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is that truth? Let us know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I am sure that some of them knows perfectly well all the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that you don't really need proof to convince anyone. Why should he have to show proof that you know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you are searching after truth... Suppose if you are searching after gold. And if I give you gold, why don't you accept it? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Apparently his position is that by their research, they have discovered the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that truth? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says it's the same truth that we are following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, same truth, this is vague. But what is the tangible presentation of the truth. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he can't explain it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can explain it. Why does he not take from us? We can explain it. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he knows truth, let him explain. If he does not know, take from us. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> I do not. Be careful. I am trying to understand. I do not. I don't say to you I know the truth, not at all. I hope to know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you take truth from us? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says because he already has a guru and he already has everything he needs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But your guru has not given you the truth. You do not know. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that the guru doesn't give the truth just like that. He says it's something that you have to work for little by little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he does not know what is truth. We can give truth. Just like I give you some money, "Here, take this hundred dollars," we can give the truth in that way. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Why he should take it just like that when he can go on as he is going, preparing himself little bit by little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why little bit? If he gets the, I mean to say, thing immediately, why should you go little by little? (French) Suppose you are... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says because he finds it more pleasing. His spiritual master has given him a name Ratnānanda, and he says that that name means one who prepares himself little by little for the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But is that very good intelligence? Suppose you are searching after one million dollars. You are working little by little, little, and if somebody says, "Here is one million dollar. You take it," Why don't you take it? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says it's a moral question. He already has his guru, and his guru has died. He's gone over to the other side, and he can't change gurus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is no question of changing guru. If he is actually searching after the truth, then why he is denying the truth when it is delivered? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He would have to be sure that it was the actual highest truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sallaz:</span> The real truth, eternal truth. Because you see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That we are... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is what the conclusion we came to yesterday with that other guest, that he says they have also find truths in China, they have also found truths in other scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that truth? (French) [break] ...is that reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he himself, he doesn't have the words to describe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you cannot describe the reality, then you have not received the reality. (French) [break] That means, as soon as you say you cannot describe, then you have no idea what is the reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He's willing to admit that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you are actually searching after reality, why not, if reality is available from other source, why don't you take it? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Because certainly his members would have some questions they would want to ask you, and perhaps even you might have some questions that you would want to ask his members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. We are prepared. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I think the thing is to make arrangement for such a meeting. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then make arrangement. But our pro... (end)</div>
