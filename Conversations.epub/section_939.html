<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's a very big library, many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have all our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. Including the earlier <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda's earlier volumes from India; it's available there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) You like our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement? You know how we have got New Vrindaban here in America? We are giving protection to the cows. In New Orleans, and what other places?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Virginia, Rūpānuga's farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tennessee, Bridesville.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, some of Indian people, they quote <span class="Italic">Veda</span> and say that beef-eating was recommended in <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and I don't know whether it's true or not, but they quote <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> <span class="Italic">Atharva-veda</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they give any quotation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No, they don't give any quotation, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascals. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Even scientifically now it is being proven that many of the diseases, like of the kidneys, of the heart, arterial sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, uremia, gout, is because of high protein diet, particularly meat. Many of the scientists now are going away from meat by chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> By chanting Kṛṣṇa we also feel that meat is no longer necessity, in fact it is harmful for longevity and health of the body. So whether it is beef, pork or anything, all this meat is very harmful. Both in Heart Institute, cancer and other, they are finding that meat is harmful for the body-on scientific grounds, religious grounds apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? The Christians claim that Christ ate meat and therefore there's nothing wrong with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The Christians say that Christ ate meat himself, that there's nothing wrong with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Christ ate meat? I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you should maintain slaughterhouse. Very good reasoning. Because Christ ate fish, therefore we should maintain big, big slaughterhouse? Is that good reasoning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Meat-eating is not useful from three points of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, apart from that. He said that Christ ate fish, therefore we should maintain big, big slaughterhouse. What do you think? Is that good reasoning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, it's demoniac by common sense if you maintain large slaughterhouses, it's completely irreligious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When Christ said "Thou shalt not kill," does it mean that he wanted to maintain slaughterhouse? What is the answer, hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> The Christians say that you kill the vegetables, you slaughter the vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we shall kill father, mother. You kill vegetables, therefore I shall kill my father and mother. Is that reasoning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I have a different concept of (indistinct), if I may give: When I'll be half as good as Christ, maybe I can be permitted to eat meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, take the example of Christ. But because he ate fish, so because we eat vegetables, therefore a good cause for eating father and mother? For killing child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say that only the human has a soul, therefore it's wrong to kill humans. But other animals you can kill because there is no soul. That is their argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They'll ask what should be killed and what shouldn't be killed for eating? Where do we draw the line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you, we are speaking <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> That is not point of view of killing. There are other animals. We do not say that you stop. If you want to eat some meat, at least don't kill cow. You can kill other insignificant animals which has no importance. Cow has got special importance because it supplies milk, and milk is very essential food that is... From the childhood, a child lives on milk, and there are many saintly persons, they also live by drinking milk. Milk is very important item in the human society, and it supplies all vitamins. Even if you say that "Meat-eating is essential for me," you can eat other animals, but don't kill cows. That is our proposal. Give protection to the cows. Kṛṣṇa mentioned specifically, <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> He does not say that you don't kill, but you give protection to the cows. And if you want to eat meat, you can kill other animals. On the whole, <span class="Italic">paśu-hiṁsā,</span> any animal killing, is not good for spiritual life. And so far vegetable is concerned, everyone has to eat something. So if you can eat vegetables, that does not mean because somebody is killing vegetables, he should kill his own father and mother on that plea. So cow is mother because we are drinking her milk. So you cannot put any argument in favor of killing mother. If you... Anyone who supplies milk from the body, she is mother. According to Vedic civilization, cow is one of the seven mothers. There are seven mothers: the real mother, <span class="Italic">ātma-mātā guroḥ patnī,</span> the wife of spiritual master; then queen, <span class="Italic">rāja-patnikā. Ātma-mātā guroḥ patnī brāhmaṇī,</span> the wife of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> In this way, especially, seven mothers, <span class="Italic">dhenu, dhenu</span> means cow, and <span class="Italic">dhātrī,</span> nurse, she is also mother. So from that point of view, cow is mother, and you cannot kill on any ground the mother. That is not good reasoning. You are taking the last drop of milk. In South Africa you said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They have one slaughterhouse and just beside, I have seen, just beside there is dairy. So at night they bring the cows in to the dairy, milk them to the last drop, and then to the slaughterhouse and all night screaming. I heard because the Indian neighborhood was about five hundred yards from the slaughterhouse. Then in the morning you'd drive by and the carcasses are hanging up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are drawing the last drop of milk from the cow and sending her to the slaughterhouse. Is that very good civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Swamiji, the beef industry here is based more on... The argument of mother would be a little weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> The beef industry here is more based on steers, which are not, which are basically bulls given high estrogens and bred in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, we are layman, and we follow Kṛṣṇa's instruction that cow, milk is very important, we drink the cow's milk, therefore she is mother. So at least she should be saved from being killed. This is common sense. Apart from other big, big reasoning, we take it, Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya,</span> so we take it. Besides that, so far vegetables are concerned, Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati: [</span>Bg. 9.26] "If anyone offers Me even <span class="Italic">patram,</span>" <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam,</span>"I eat them." So we take Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So Kṛṣṇa says "You give Me these vegetables, plants." So we offer Him, and then we take. Besides that, everybody has to eat something. So generally, food grains, vegetables, they are recommended for eating purpose. And those who want to eat meat or fish, they can do so, but at least they can avoid the important life of cow. That is recommended. So far we are concerned, we are eating Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa, and this, there is no such thing as meat or fish, or egg, but we are living. Not that because we do not eat meat or fish, we are dying. We can eat very easily. <span class="Italic">Anna. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Actually, if we take food grains like wheat, rice, pulses, vegetables, fruits, milk, that is quite sufficient, nutritious foodstuff, full with vitamins and, what is called, protein, carbohydrate. That is sufficient. Why should we kill? At least, cow? That is our request, because Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> And in His practical life He played as a cowherd boy giving protection to other cows. There is a picture, Kṛṣṇa is sitting, and the cow and the calf is feeling very safety. Kṛṣṇa is embracing. So because we want to be Kṛṣṇa conscious, we want to follow His personal behavior and instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Prabhupāda? For every animal except the cow, you said, like a..., does a person have to pay off a one-to-one ratio for the animal killed? He just has to come back one time for, like, killing a goat? Is it just one time then, instead of many times?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> His question is that is there some formula, that if you kill one animal or one thing then you get killed in the exact same ratio? You kill one thing, you get killed once. So in other words, if you are responsible for killing hundreds and hundreds of animals throughout your lifetime, does one have to take birth hundreds and hundreds of times and be killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. For killing, you cannot kill even vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> This is Mr., ah, what's your name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Boyd.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Mr. Boyd. His daughter is a devotee in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Barbara. I had the privilege of going to India a month ago and bringing her home, and I met two of your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Yes, she was at Vṛndāvana, and she'd been there for about three months. She contracted malaria, I guess, and was not doing too well, and we got concerned. So we went down to see how she was. She was due to go back to Germany, so we brought her back here and got her back in shape, I guess, and sent her back to Germany. And while we were there I met one of your friends, I guess, a fellow named Mr. Dubhai?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dubhai, yes, in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> You know him, and Himāvatī. I told them I'd see you pretty soon. I thought maybe you might be interested in seeing a few pictures? She said she was your friend, and you were her very good friend, and sent her regards to you. (laughter) That's quite a temple in Vṛndāvana. Very impressive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you liked it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Yes, it was quite startling to come up the roadway there, and things looked pretty desolate, and all of a sudden here's this beautiful temple sitting here, and it was a real experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, here is Mr. Dubhai's picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Yes. (laughter) He was quite a gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You stayed in the guesthouse there too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> No, I was just there a short time, I had to come back. We were only down there about four days. We had to bring back Barbara, she was in pretty rough shape. She had gotten malaria, only she wasn't doing too well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> That's just down the street from Mr. Dubhai, that's a big tree, it's an Indian tree, I don't know what it is, it grows up and down both. It happened to be in his yard. (laughter) Another highlight of the day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Banyan tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have banyan trees in America. In Florida.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Oh, is that banyan tree? You see, they are not particular to this area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hawaii's full of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> That's not what I find in the backyard. That was the first time I'd seen one. They indicated that the day before, they'd walked by there and was startled, there was an elephant standing under it. First time they'd seen one. Of course, you know, it's out of environment, if all of a sudden you see one, you don't realize it. I didn't realize it either, but in India elephants are commonplace. But it's not common for me to be in India. (laughter) I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the country, though, in that area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, very nice pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> The two that were taken in Philadelphia, they are not what I call quality work, but are the best I could do and run. You didn't sit still too long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This child is your daughter's son?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> No, that little fellow came from Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has got children? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> No, she doesn't have children, but Haṁsadūta Mahārāja sent this child for Himāvatī to take care of at the school, and I guess the school was not ready yet, but she's taking care of him now, and he's a handful, too. She came up to New Delhi with us and spent a couple nights while we were getting some passports straightened around and visas cleared up. We had "Baldy," they called him-I never did know his name. We had a good time with him. It's a real pleasure having this opportunity to meet you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Barbara's been in the movement for two and half years and it's been..., we've heard a lot about you and a lot about the movement, and we've kept pretty close, you know, track of what's going on, and we've visited the different temples and talked to the different devotees, and we're quite impressed with the action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are having the difficulties of this immigration department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> I guess, if it's like India, you've got troubles. We almost went to jail rather than get out of the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We think, according to our philosophy, everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, and we are all sons. So everyone has the right to use the property of the father. So that consciousness should be spread. This barrier of nationalism is against Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why there should be? Actually everything belongs to God. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> The sky, the land, the water, they are all creation of God, God's property. But we should not take more than what is allotted to us. That is real life. Otherwise, I have practically studied that there is enough land. Just like in your country, in America, there is enough land, not utilized. They can be properly utilized, and if food grains are produced, there is no question of scarcity of food all over the world. Not only in America-in Africa, in Australia. [break] If we get nourishing food, every one of us, so there is no economic problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> How do we handle these people who don't seem to want to carry their own weight, though, Prabhupāda? The ones who don't want to work and help produce this food?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should be trained up. Therefore Vedic civilization is training. Some section of the people, they should be very intellectuals, brain, just like to maintain this body we require first of all the brain. If the brain is not order, then other parts, they may be there, but they are also useless. So similarly, in the society, some intellectuals should be maintained. They are called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> and some of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> They are simply meant for giving good instruction. They should personally become very good and intellectual, and they should give instruction to other people what is the value of life, how to live. This is one section. They should be free from the anxiety of maintaining themselves. The society should treat them as children and give them all necessities, bare necessities, not they are meant for living very luxuriously. No. Simple living. Then the next class, <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> the politicians, administrators, they are also required to give protection to the people from injury. <span class="Italic">Kṣatriya, kṣat</span> means injury, and <span class="Italic">trāyate,</span> "one who saves people from injury." It is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's</span> duty. So <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> should protect all the living entities, including the animals. They are also subjects. So the first, intellectual <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> then <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Then <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> their business is to produce food. Food production you can do by agriculture, <span class="Italic">kṛṣi,</span> and by giving protection to the cows. If you get sufficient food grains, like rice, wheat, pulses, and sufficient milk-from milk you get yogurt, butter, <span class="Italic">ghee</span>-then your all food problem is solved. You must eat. You must eat, you must live properly. So this first, second, third, the intellectual class, the administrative class, and the productive class, these three classes must be there in the society. And those who cannot be grouped either of these three classes, they should generally help as workers. They are called <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> So the workers means... Suppose you require a sitting place: the carpenter is there. Suppose you require a knife: so the blacksmith is there. You require clothing: the weaver is there. In this way, four classes of men. First class, second class, third class, or the intellectuals, the administrators, the producers and the general workers. This is Vedic system of division. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa...</span> This is for our living condition, and then human life especially meant for spiritual realization, self-realization. For that purpose, again, another four divisions. Generally, the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> student life; <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> married life; <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> retired life; and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> renounced life. So at the end of life one should be renounced from all other responsibilities and completely devote his life for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or God consciousness. In this way, when a person dies in God consciousness, his life is perfect. This is Vedic civilization. Eight divisions, <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> And if you simply produce <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> working class, then you cannot have any happiness. That is not possible. And nowadays democratic, if you send some <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> to act as <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they cannot do it. You have got practical experience. In Vietnam, what happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The American soldiers, they were simply taking intoxication, hunting after prostitutes and running from the enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when they were attacked, they were running away. Because they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> How they can fight? They are not trained up as <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> Huh? Anyone who is unemployed, let him become a soldier, but he cannot fight. That is not possible. Neither this class of men can have good brain to give direction to the society. The democracy means anyone can go to the government, and because he's not <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> his only business is how to get money so long he's on the post. Just like you did not like your President, Mr. Nixon. So that is the risk. If you keep the society in chaotic condition, any department, intellectual, administration, production, they'll be all topsy turvey, and there cannot be any peace in the world. So this Vedic scheme, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> is a very important scheme. If possible it should be introduced and taken up very seriously. That is one of the items of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, to reestablish the institution of <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> Not by birth, but by qualification. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">. Guṇa-karma,</span> by quality. In India, the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> is there, but it is not organized because the government does not take care. The government is imitating Western way of life, "There is no need of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> there is no need of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> simply <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span>" Everywhere this is the position, the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> population, <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra sambhavaḥ.</span> In this age everyone is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So it doesn't matter, everyone is born <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> but he should be trained up. Just like in our practical life we see that everyone is not born a scientist or engineer or lawyer. Everyone is born innocent, child, then he's trained up by the guardians. Similarly, there should be a training how to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> how to become <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> how to become <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> And the government should see that everyone, as he is trained up, he is working according to his quality and occupational duty. Then there will be complete peace and harmony. That human society is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> His question is that now the government is corrupt, so what can be immediately done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How there can be, because the democracy? You are corrupt, therefore your government is corrupt. You correct yourself, the government will be automatically corrected. If you are rascals, the government will be rascals. The government means elected. So if you are not rascal, you'll not elect another rascal to take charge of the government affairs. But because you are rascal, you'll send another rascal. So how can you expect good government? You do not know whom to select. And besides that, the whole population is rascal, <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So anyone you elect, if he's by qualification he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> worker, he's not intelligent person, he's not <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he's not <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Actually, the legislative assembly, or in your country, Senate? They should be all <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> They give advice. Formerly this was the system. Although it was monarchy, even Lord Rāmacandra or similar kings, they were not ruling independently-they were taking advice from learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> sages. So the legislative assembly should be composition of intellectual <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Then the other administrators, the President or the minister, they should be <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> In this way, if social organization is made, then there will be perfect peace. If <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are allowed to rule over, what they know? Their only aim is that so long he is in the office, "Let me collect some money," that's all. And that will be the latest atmosphere, <span class="Italic">dasyu-dharmabhiḥ. Rājanyair dasyu-dharmabhiḥ.</span> All the government men will become thieves and rogues. <span class="Italic">Dasyu, dasyu</span> means thieves and rogues. So as the thieves and rogues capture you on the street and ask "Whatever you have got, give, otherwise I shall kill you," so this will be the position in the Kali-yuga. It is happening now. You cannot have any private property; everything you have to declare. Otherwise, it will be taken by force. So people will be very much embarrassed by two things: one thing is taxation, and another thing will be scarcity of food. In this way, all the people all over the world will be embarrassed, so much so that they will leave their home, hearth and home, <span class="Italic">ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā yāsyanti giri-kānanam.</span> Being separated from family and property, they will take shelter in the hilly ranges or in the forest to get relief. This will be the position. Harassment, so much harassment, by nature, by government. So therefore for complete happy society, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is essential. All intelligent persons, they should join this movement and reform the present social, political, religious. All field of activities, they should reform. Then people will be happy. Not only happy in this life, but also next life. Unfortunately, the present education does not provide knowledge of next life. There is no such education. They are kept in darkness like cats and dogs. They do not know that there is life after death, and we get our next life according to our present activities-<span class="Italic">karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are unknown. Very risky life. If I am prime minister in this life or president, and if I am going to become a dog next life, then what is the benefit of becoming prime minister or president? And nature's law is that you get your next life according to the mentality at the time of death. So if I have acted like cats and dogs throughout whole life, naturally I shall think like cats and dogs at the time of death. Then next life is cats and dogs. So I may be worshiped here in a statue, that "Here is our beloved prime minister," and next life, I'm barking as a dog. Then what is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Well, that might depend on what kind of prime minister you were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is possible, I can become prime minister or any big man. But if I do not work properly, if I work like animal, then my next life is animal. There is no consideration that "Here is a prime minister, why he should become a dog?" Nature will act. If you infect some disease, you may be prime minister or you may be a common man, if you have infected that disease, you must suffer from that disease. That is nature's law. There is no consideration that "Here is prime minister. He has infected the malaria germs. He should not suffer." Nature's law if not like that. Just like you say that in India there is malaria. So your daughter was not excused, that "Here is a girl coming of very respectable, good family. She should be excused." No excuse. You have infected malaria germ, you must suffer. So similarly, <span class="Italic">kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are associating with different modes of material nature, and according to our association, <span class="Italic">sat, asat,</span> good birth or low-class birth is there-either as demigods in the higher planetary system or human being in the middle planetary system or as animals, low class. There are three classes of birth. That depends on our association with the modes of material nature-goodness, passion or ignorance. So at least in the human form of life nobody should be kept in ignorance. The facility must be given. That is civilization. Every human being should have the greatest opportunity to make his life successful. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Every human being is open to accept the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and make his life successful. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is our propaganda, to give everyone the facility of perfection of life. Now somebody may take or somebody may not take, but the basic principle of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to offer everyone the best facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Prabhupāda, what about in the case where you have this ideal civilization with the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> instructing, but the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> don't agree? Just like in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, there were many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> but they didn't agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There were many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span>? Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Well there's..., well, there was, they were great kings, right? But they didn't agree on how..., who should have the kingdom? Arjuna and his relatives were in disagreement, great <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas,</span> they are not <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> So when there is disagreement, there is fight. The battle will decide. That is always, at the present moment also. When there is disagreement between nation and nation, there is war declaration. That is natural.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Furman:</span> It was a very good representation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is not a sectarian religious sentimental movement. It is a movement for giving real education, knowledge, to the people all over the world without any discrimination. So at least those who are intelligent class of men, they should join and study this movement and try to broadcast for the good of the human society. The basic principles I have already explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> A statement was made some time ago in a conversation that somebody was looking for the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> without the <span class="Italic">Rāma.</span> Could you explain what they might be meaning by that?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who made the statement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> I don't think it makes any difference who made the statement, it was just a comment that somebody wanted the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> without <span class="Italic">Rāma,</span> which indicated to me that they didn't want the whole picture, they didn't want the total fact. But otherwise I couldn't put the two together, because Barbara must have taken the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> back to Germany with her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Actually here is a one-to-one translation. (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Tulasī dāsa's <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> means <span class="Italic">Rāma-carita.</span> It is not <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa. Rāma-carita Manas.</span> He was devotee of Lord Rāmacandra. So as he was thinking of Lord Rāmacandra, he has written. So he was a learned scholar, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he must have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavatam.</span> So all his translation is there on the basis of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> especially <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You'll find many parallel passages. But <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is the summary of all Vedic literature, and it is spoken by the Personality of Godhead. So if we fix up our attention on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then you can get advantage of all other <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This is Mr. Kruzowsky. He's a philosophy teacher at the University of Maryland. He's very much interested in yoga and meditation. He invited us to speak earlier this year in his class, philosophy and religion.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We had some talk with Professor Kotovsky in Moscow. Recently our representative went to Moscow for selling our book. They have highly appreciated our books. They have given in writing appreciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Your Grace, in regards to the organization of the movement, as such, I somehow am led to believe that there's no coordination between, should I say, your office, in regards to the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> world, and the different temples. Are each..., does each temple operate by itself, or each division operate by itself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, (indistinct). There is separate arrangement for management, but the idea and philosophy is the same. Ultimately, I am managing. I have my twenty secretaries, they are called GBC, they are assisting me to manage. Every GBC has got a certain number of temples to supervise, and ultimately, I supervise everything. Therefore I come occasionally, stay for few days to see how things are going on. I have got hundred temples, big, big temples, very nice. They have organized palatial buildings, but I cannot stay anywhere. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> That's the trouble with being boss. If you don't do it, nobody else will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as I say, "Ah, it is very nice place," the time is over, they say "You please get out." (laughter and groans from devotees)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> The school in Vṛndāvana, is this, I assume this is to be out there in the yard that they were clearing. When do you anticipate that will be built?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they clear the land, we are going to construct a nice building for the school. As soon as it is done, then we will organize. <span class="Italic">Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān... [SB </span>7.6.1]. From the very beginning of life, this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> principle should be trained. That is perfect. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī guru-kule vasan dānto guror hitam [SB </span>7.12.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> They should be trained up how to read at the house of the spiritual master. They should be trained up how to control the senses, <span class="Italic">dānta. Dānta</span> means to practice how to control the senses. That is the difference between human being and animal. Animal cannot be trained up how to control their senses. That is not possible. But a human being can be trained up to control his senses. The yoga practice is meant for controlling the sense. <span class="Italic">Yoga-indriya-saṁyamī.</span> That is the real yoga practice, not that I indulge in sense gratification as I like, and I become a yogi. This is all bogus. This is not yoga. Yoga means how to control the senses. Then I can concentrate my mind towards God realization and self-realization. If my senses are always disturbing, it is not possible to apply my mind for self-realization. That is not possible. Therefore the yoga practice, preliminary practice, is <span class="Italic">yama-niyama,</span> controlling, <span class="Italic">niyama,</span> under regulative principles. They are all described in the Sixth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and other Vedic literature also. And the ultimate end of yoga practice is to think of Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think there is any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no fundamental difference. The same. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> recommends that you should select a very secluded place in a solitary sacred place, you should make your <span class="Italic">āsana,</span> sit down perpendicularly, don't close your eyes completely, half open, and concentrate on the tip of the nose. Everything is there. "And then think of Me." But Arjuna said, he said, "Oh, it is not possible." He was a frank gentleman. He was not a hypocrite. He said that "You are recommending all these yoga practice, it is not possible for me. I am a politician, I have to execute so many other businesses. I cannot go to the secluded place and sit down like this. So you are recommending me for yoga practice, but I say I cannot." But at the present moment, they have become more than Arjuna. (laughs) What Arjuna denied, they want to practice. This is another hypocrisy. Arjuna was not an ordinary man. He was so exalted that he could speak with Kṛṣṇa directly, and coming from royal family, and he's famous as great fighter. He refused, "I cannot do that." And we are taking to yoga practice. We have become more than Arjuna. This is going on. He does not think himself that "Arjuna is such a great personality, he thought himself to be incapable to practicing yoga<span class="Italic">,</span> and we are making a show of yoga<span class="Italic">,</span> paying somebody large amounts of money"? That's all. This is going on.</div>

But in Kali-yuga you can do that, the same achievement you can have by <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana,</span> by chanting the holy name of the Lord. And factually you'll find our, these disciples, young boys and girls, they are not practicing in a secluded place the yoga system. They are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> And bring any yogi in the world and talk with them and see the comparison. Because that is fashion only; it has no practical value. And here is practical value. Maybe one or two are successful, but mass of people, yoga practice is not recommended. That is not possible to be executed. But if you take to this <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana</span> movement, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, very soon, <span class="Italic">kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati.</span> You see practically.

Just like <span class="Italic">janma...</span> There are four: to get birth in very high, aristocratic family; to become very learned scholar; to become beautiful in bodily feature. <span class="Italic">Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī [SB </span>1.8.26]<span class="Italic">:</span> high parentage, birth, to take birth in aristocratic family, in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, or very exalted royal family.

These things are obtained on account of piety, pious activities. And just the opposite, low-class family, lowborn, no money, always poverty-stricken, no education, no bodily beauty, these are the results of impious activities. So the demigods means on account of their pious activities they get the situation in higher planet where the duration of life is ten thousands of years, and their one day is equal to our six months. Such ten thousands of years. Very beautiful body, facilities. There... The other day I was reading about the bodily construction of woman there. They are ever-young, the chest is very hard. (laughs) It is stated, yes. So such class of women is there, and <span class="Italic">aiśvarya, nandana-kānana,</span> so many things. The roads are paved with pearls and jewels, not these pebbles. In the higher planetary system there is facility for higher standard of material comforts. So they get there birth and enjoy for ten thousand of years. But it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, kṣīṇe puṇye punar martya-lokaṁ viśanti.</span> As soon as they spend up their resultant action of pious activities, then again drop down, <span class="Italic">kṣīṇe puṇye punar martya-lokaṁ viśanti.</span> And again begins life from the grass.

If you want you can go again to the higher planetary system, live there for so many years, and again when your resultant action of pious activities is finished, you again come and become a grass, and again begin... This is going on. But where is the science to understand how the process is going on? Therefore people are kept in ignorance. They have dismissed the idea, that there is no life after death, that's all. (guest leaving) There is no education. They are kept in ignorance. That is the problem, risky civilization, that people are kept in dark ignorance about the problems of the life. They do not know. They are struggling from the beginning of life, but they do not know what is the problem of life. Neither they have any information what are all these different planets, how they are being used, who are using them. They have no information.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Well, for two and a half years I've been getting this from my daughter, that women cannot be reincarnated, and it didn't make sense to me.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa says that even women, he can go back to home, back to Godhead. <span class="Italic">Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.</span> There is no such thing. Anyone who is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he or she will go back to home, back to Godhead. There is no such discrimination. Ordinarily it is supposed that woman is less intelligent than the man. That's a fact. But that is in bodily understanding. But in the spiritual platform, either woman or man or cat or dog or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or... Everyone is spirit soul. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is learned, he sees everyone on the same level of spiritual platform.</div>

So this is the duty. "You give up all other duties, you simply take to Me, surrender unto Me." This is duty. All other duties, they are temporary, and this is real duty, to surrender to God. If you think that "I am giving up all other duties, my family duties, my community duty, my national duty and so many..." Because you may think like that, that "Giving up all duties, I simply become Kṛṣṇa conscious...," as Arjuna was thinking. But Kṛṣṇa gives you assurance, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "Don't worry, I shall give protection. If you think that by giving up all other duties you'll be sinful, so I give you assurance that I shall give you all protection." It is clearly stated. So this is the only duty, how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa and become His perfect devotee. This is the only duty.</div>

Because you are thinking that you are Indian, somebody is thinking he's America, somebody is thinking he's this or that. So there the advice is try to relinquish the result of your action. Don't be attached to the resultant action of your duty. The idea is to become detached, but because you cannot do it immediately, therefore the advice is, "All right, you remain in your so-called duty, but don't be attached to the result of your actions." Then where the action will go? Suppose I am a businessman and I have earned, say, two million dollars. So <span class="Italic">mā phaleṣu kadācana,</span> the result is already there, what shall I do it? Two millions of dollars, I shall throw it in the street? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Not to be attached to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not attached! It is attachment. "No attachment" means I have earned this two millions dollars, and I throw it away. That is no attachment. But that is also stated, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tat mad-arpaṇam [Bg. 9.27],</span> "Give that money to Me." Vāmanadeva. "Mahārāja Bali, you are so great personality. Give Me three feet of land." Then He covered the whole universe. So that is Kṛṣṇa's policy. <span class="Italic">Mā phaleṣu kadācana.</span> Then what shall I do with the result? "Give Me." That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> He'll not immediately give it up, but Kṛṣṇa as a beggar, as Vāmanadeva, He's asking, "Give Me." If you are actually following Kṛṣṇa's instructions, you'll give it. The actual fact is that you become attached to Kṛṣṇa and detached to everything. But as you cannot do it immediately, this is a policy. The same policy, Vāmanadeva. He went to beg from Bali Mahārāja. So Bali Mahārāja was very munificent, he gave Him, "Yes, promise, whatever You want, I shall give." So He took everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> In the Eighteenth Chapter they say <span class="Italic">sve sve karmaṇi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Sve sve karmaṇi.</span> "A man can become perfect by doing his prescribed duty."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it's a fact. If you work as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> if you are thinking yourself as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then you act as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> You cannot act as a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> As a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> you cannot accept anyone's service, then you become <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> You deviate from your own position. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> they'll never accept anyone's service, only the <span class="Italic">śūdra. Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> When you live at the mercy of others, this is called dog's business. Just like a dog lives at the mercy of the master. So it is strictly prohibited for the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Even in very difficult position, you can act as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> you can act as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> but never accept the position of a dog, a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> This is the injunction. <span class="Italic">Sve sve karmaṇi,</span> you stick to your own business. If you claim as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then you must act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then you'll become successful. You cannot remain a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and accept the business of a dog, that is not <span class="Italic">sve sve karmaṇi.</span> So everything, what is stated there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that is perfect. People at the present moment, they are living at the mercy of others. That is dog's business. Therefore (in) the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> In the Kali-yuga everyone is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> no <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> That is generally accepted. Because at the present moment education means to get some service. What is the value of that education? If you become dependent on others, then what is the value of this education? Therefore <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> Everyone is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement says <span class="Italic">striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ: [Bg. </span>9.32] never mind, even if you are <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you'll become perfect. Either you become woman or <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> or <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> it doesn't matter, or any other <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni, māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ, te 'pi yānti parām</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this is the most liberal movement, that it doesn't matter what you are, if you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness then you become perfect. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's on the Brahman platform, above all these different modes of material nature. These <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,</span> these are differences on the material platform. But when you come to the spiritual platform, there is no such difference. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are trying to bring everyone to that spiritual platform. Therefore they cannot understand. They vision everything from materialistic point of view. They have no idea of spiritual life, therefore they misunderstand. But if we read thoroughly <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then everything is clear. <span class="Italic">Sve sve karmaṇi</span> means he must act according to his position. If he claims to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he must act as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Guṇa-karma.</span> If you actually have the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> qualification, you must act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Otherwise, what is the use of claiming that "I am a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>"? That is not accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? The <span class="Italic">karmī</span> is thinking that service to humanity is the real high platform because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the best service to humanity, to raise them from gross ignorance of animal life. This is best service. People are in gross ignorance of animal life, and Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to raise him from that animal life to spiritual life, that is the best service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Prabhupāda? Is Kṛṣṇa right here in the room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Don't you see Kṛṣṇa there? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> When I'm looking at the picture, is Kṛṣṇa right here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether you look or not look, He's there. If you have got some eye disease, you cannot see. But He is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām [Bg. 18.61].</span></div>

Sadaiva,</span> on account of his love... That is a very common sense. If you love somebody, wherever you are, you are seeing your lover, "When I shall meet him, where he is, what he is doing?" That was the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span>' business. Kṛṣṇa was on the pasturing ground, and <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are crying at home that "Kṛṣṇa's foot is so soft, and He is walking in the fields barefooted. How many, these crags, pricking Him?" In this way thinking, thinking, they were crying. Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you say in your books so many times that somehow or other we have fallen into this material world due to our enviousness or our independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many, there are many reasons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> I can't seem to get a grasp on this at all. If we in our original constitutional position as part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, and in that position, that original position of full knowledge and full bliss and being in our eternal nature... Now I have some experience of how strong this material energy is and how <span class="Italic">māyā</span> works somewhat, but if I had known this and had this full knowledge, then I would have had this knowledge of how <span class="Italic">māyā</span> works and how I might fall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You read the life of Jaya, Vijaya, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Hiraṇyākṣa? They were Kṛṣṇa's doorkeepers. How they fell down? Did you read it? Did you read the life of Hiraṇyakaśipu or Hiraṇyākṣa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how they did fall? They are from Vaikuṇṭha. They are Kṛṣṇa's personal associates, keeping the doorkeepers. How did they fell down? Anyway, there is chance of falling down at any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Well, in his family they wanted to enjoy the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, the falldown is there. So because we are living entities, we are not as powerful as Kṛṣṇa, therefore we may fall down from Vaikuṇṭha at any moment. <span class="Italic">Icchā-dveṣa samutthena sarge yānti parantapa.</span> Find out this verse.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire and hate. Due to desire and hate the ignorant person wants to become one with the Supreme Lord and envies Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated by desire and hate, can understand that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appears by His internal potencies. But those who are deluded by duality and nescience think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons symptomatically dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking 'This is my wife, this is my house; I am the master of this house, I am the husband of this wife.' These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So even in the Vaikuṇṭha, if I desire that "Why shall I serve Kṛṣṇa? Why not become Kṛṣṇa?" I immediately fall down. That is natural. A servant is serving the master, sometimes he may think that "If I could become the master." They are thinking like that, they are trying to become God. That is delusion. You cannot become God. That is not possible. But he's wrongly thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Why doesn't Kṛṣṇa protect us from that desire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's protecting. He says, "You rascal, don't desire, surrender unto Me." But you are rascal, you do not do this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Why doesn't He save me from thinking like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you lose your independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> And no love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is force. (indistinct) <span class="Italic">prema.</span> In Bengali it is said "If you catch one girl or boy, 'You love me, you love me, you love me.' " Is it love? (laughter) "You love me, otherwise I will kill you." (laughter) Is that love? So Kṛṣṇa does not want to become a lover like that, on the point of revolver, "You love me, otherwise I shall kill you." That is not love, that is threatening. Love is reciprocal, voluntary, good exchange of feeling, then there is love, not by force. That is rape. The... Why one is called lover, another is called rape?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> But isn't it by force anyway? If we don't love Kṛṣṇa, we suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your business. You'll suffer. But that Kṛṣṇa does not force you. He says the real, "You love me, you'll be happy. If you don't love, you suffer." But that is your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> So what is the choice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Choice is yours. If you are rascal, you don't make the choice, the best choice. You suffer. The rascals, they suffer. And intelligent men, they do not suffer. If you are intelligent, then Kṛṣṇa says that "You surrender to Me," you surrender, then you are intelligent. If you are rascal, then you reject and you suffer. When a father says to his rascal son, "My dear son, you just hear me, do like this, you'll be happy." If he does not do it, he'll suffer. There is no other alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, why is the material world made on the level of a jailhouse? It's made on the level of a jailhouse, that, I've been told, the attitude of a jail instead of the attitude.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because there will be so many criminals. Therefore government has to construct a jailhouse. It is government's not desire. It is expensive, unnecessary. But because there are rascals who will become criminal, the government has jailhouse. So one who wants to remain independent of Kṛṣṇa, for them there is material world, "All right, you remain here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> We also say that Kṛṣṇa is fulfilling the desires of every living entity. So if we want to enjoy independent of Kṛṣṇa, why doesn't He let us really enjoy independent of Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. That is <span class="Italic">māyā</span> it is called. You are not enjoyer, you are servant. Because you are willing to become enjoyer, you suffer, that's all. You are not enjoyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Then He's not fulfilling the desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you wanted to enjoy-enjoy at your risk. Sometimes you'll become the king of heaven, and sometimes you become the germs in the stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Hm, enjoy at your risk. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, that is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Instead of under His protection, you enjoy at your risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He advises, "Rascal, you give up all this enjoying spirit. You just surrender to Me, you'll be happy." But we don't accept it. Therefore sometimes we are in the heavenly kingdom, sometimes as a worm in the stool. That is going on. That is your risk. What is that? <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpāḥ? </span></div>

If, even you are poor man, you can bring some fruit or flower to Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa, I am poor man, I can't give You anything more. But I have secured this fruit and flower. Kindly accept it." Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes." <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati tad aham aśnāmi [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So where is the difficulty? <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> You remain a carpenter, but you worship Kṛṣṇa. That is not a very difficult job, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But here in this country we have choices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this country or that country, there is no such distinction. This <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam,</span> any country you can get it. You cannot say in America there is no <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam,</span> in India only. No. Everywhere it is available. Therefore this general prescription is there. Even Kṛṣṇa does not say <span class="Italic">Gaṅgā-jala.</span> Because Gaṅgā, if you say <span class="Italic">Gaṅgā-jala,</span> that is available in India. He says <span class="Italic">toyam,</span> any <span class="Italic">jala,</span> any water. Because any water, as soon as touches the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, it becomes Gaṅgā. Why Gaṅgā is so adored? Because it is coming from the toes of Kṛṣṇa. So any water touching Kṛṣṇa's toes, that becomes Gaṅgā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if we're born each with a qualification, how is this qualification developed in our early years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of developing any particular qualification. Whatever qualification you are, if you agree to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, that is the best qualification. It doesn't matter what material qualification you have. It doesn't matter. You simply acquire this qualification, that "From this day I fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa." That everyone can do. Is there any difficulty? Simply he must agree, this qualification. That depends on him, agree or not agree. If you agree, then you become qualified. If you don't agree, you remain disqualified. So that is intelligence. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> After many, many births of struggle, one who is fully in knowledge, he surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān.</span> Not the foolish. Foolish person cannot. But <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> You can become immediately <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. That is intelligence. Why shall I wait for many many births to become a <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span>? Let me surrender immediately and become a <span class="Italic">mahātmā. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ bhajanty ananya-manasaḥ [Bg. </span>9.13]-chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, become a <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> It is not very difficult. You can become <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> immediately, within a second. But the disease is that you'll not agree to Kṛṣṇa. That is the dangerous disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> When you say surrender, it means surrender of fruits of the action?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, surrender your life. That includes surrender of fruits and everything. Surrender your life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Surrender He uses many places, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">, karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but that is not surrender. When you keep yourself in your so-called duty, that recommendation is there. But when you fully surrender, there is no more <span class="Italic">karma,</span> everything is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> And because you do not surrender, therefore He is recommending that you do your <span class="Italic">karma</span> like this. But as soon as you surrender, you are above <span class="Italic">karma. Sa guṇān sama-tītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya,</span> you are <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> So long you do not surrender, He is linking your activities with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, "You do like this." Then one day you'll be able to surrender. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja, he wanted the kingdom better than his father, grandfather. So he had to undergo so much severe austerities. He got Kṛṣṇa. But when he got Kṛṣṇa, he said <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varam,</span> "I don't want any benediction." So this position you can attain any moment, "My Lord, I surrender unto You. I don't want anything from You. Kindly give me shelter at Your lotus feet." This is the result of greatest <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> And Kṛṣṇa gives you protection. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> So that is the highest perfection of life, to surrender to God without any reservations. Then life is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Prabhupāda, even if a person is not willing to hear spiritual knowledge, when you come and speak, a person, you know, can develop faith in Kṛṣṇa or God. So why doesn't Kṛṣṇa come and make it easy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa has already come. What I am speaking? Kṛṣṇa is there. But you have no eyes to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> All right, but we don't have any eyes, someone may not have eyes to see who you are, may not be willing, but when you come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's word are not different. If you find it different, then you have no eyes to see. Kṛṣṇa is absolute. When I quote Kṛṣṇa's word, that means Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> But everyone sees it as different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he is a rascal. He has to become a sane man, then he will see. It requires <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> It is not so easy. That is called <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span> Why you want such exalted things so easily? Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's words, they are the same. <span class="Italic">Vāco vācaḥ.(?)</span> The same thing. Why you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? If Kṛṣṇa's name and Kṛṣṇa is not the same, then what is the use of wasting time? Hm? What is that? <span class="Italic">Abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"> This is the realization of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, when you understand that <span class="Italic">nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaḥ,</span> this name, Kṛṣṇa, is Kṛṣṇa. That is the perfection of chanting. <span class="Italic">Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ.</span> Full representation or full Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto 'bhinnatvāt,</span> Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's anything. Just like we are worshiping Kṛṣṇa. If you think this is a statue of Kṛṣṇa, it is different from Kṛṣṇa, then you are not worshiping properly. He is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-mati,</span> these are instructions. So anyway, we may be in the imperfect stage of devotional service, but if you follow the instruction, then gradually you come to the perfectional stage. There is no hopelessness. Continue. It is not that immediately one becomes perfect. But if you continue with the process, then you'll become perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was twenty-seven years old and I learned about God through Jesus. I was twenty-seven. For thirty-five years I thought I had a relation with... [break] ...and through your knowledge that you are writing. I'm a servant of the government right now, and will it take more love of Kṛṣṇa for me to be devotee, or what...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can become a devotee even if you are a government servant. It does not hamper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So I can hear and I can chant and I can pray and I can serve and I can do all those and still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You become a devotee. Any material condition does not hamper your devotional life. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> If any condition of life you remain a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, that is success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Must initiation be there, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Initiation must be there. Otherwise, how you'll be guided? But it is not necessary, but if you can cent percent engagement in Kṛṣṇa, that is better. Just like Sanātana Gosvāmī, he was a minister, so he resigned and became cent percent servitor of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But if it is not possible, it does not hamper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But I can retire in twenty days, and if that is possible, then I can make one more good step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, oh, yes. So twenty days you are going. That means compulsory retirement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, my... I can retire or not retire. I can work until eight more years as a servant of the government. And at the same time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't retire sentimentally. Yes, don't retire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But through Kṛṣṇa's love I can retire...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, but not sentimentally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman guest (2):</span> Could you... Do you think you could explain to me about the Deities and how it's different from idol worship? Because no one has been able to explain that to my understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Idol means your imagination. And Deity is not imaginary. Deity is installed by the authorized person and it is worshiped according to authorized methods. So it is not idol. Idol worship, you imagine something and, some doll or idol, and do in your own way, that is idol worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> She's saying but it's manufactured, it's made, graven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter. But it is made according to the Vedic principles. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> Kṛṣṇa's form is described, <span class="Italic">veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣam [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is playing on His flute, <span class="Italic">veṇuṁ kvaṇantam.</span> His eyes are like the petals of the lotus flower. So if you follow the description, then it is coming from the Vedic literature or Vedic knowledge. It is not that an artistic way of imagining some idol, the eyes are like this and He must play flute. It is not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman guest (2):</span> That's because it came from scriptures instead of from men's minds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore it is authorized. When you take anything from the statute, book, that is law. And if you manufacture something, that is not law. Just like, I'll give you one very good example. Just like in your front of your house there is U.S. letterbox. So another man, he sees that the box is in front of his house, "Why shall I go so far? Let me manufacture a box here." So he's posting. After six months, he'll see all these letters are lying there. (laughter) And one who is posting that authorized box, his letter is going to thousands and thousands of miles away. So you cannot imitate. If you imitate U.S. letterbox in front of your house and post your letters, it will never go, it will remain there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Your Grace? I don't understand how it can be all right for a person to lie, even if he is a shopkeeper or a diplomat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot do business without speaking lies; you have to do it. What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You can do business without speaking lies-you just don't make so much money.</div>

It is not the question of... Sometimes they mistake the vegetable is good, meat is not good. May be, comparative. But either vegetable or meat, if you simply cook it for your tongue's satisfaction, then it is sinful. And if you offer to Kṛṣṇa, maybe only little <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> not very gorgeous, palatable dishes, and if you eat that, then <span class="Italic">bhuñjate,</span> again. <span class="Italic">Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ,</span> he becomes free from all sinful actions.

Suppose you are drinking, so you are getting some pleasure by the taste of the drinking, and if you think that this taste is Kṛṣṇa, then gradually you'll give up this drinking.

It doesn't require much learning, much education, simply take the words of Kṛṣṇa and he becomes a vast learned person. Kṛṣṇa is giving all the instruction.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Prabhupāda, here in the Western world, we're so caught up in sense enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not speak of Western world or Eastern world, we speak for all world. What we are speaking, that is for all world, not Western or Eastern. There is no such thing in the teachings of Kṛṣṇa. He never says that it is meant for the Eastern or Western. He says <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ yāḥ</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> For everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Your Grace, how is it that the devotees who run the great temple of Jagannātha refuse to allow foreigners and certain low-caste people, when this was the favorite place of Lord Caitanya, who, like you say, advocated that it should be taught in every town and village?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jagannātha Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Are these administrators fallen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's asking why can't your disciples from the West in particular, who are low-class particular people, like the Mohammedans, as traditional, they are not allowed in the Jagannātha Purī temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their fault. They should not have done so. That is their, what is called? Sectarian prejudice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Was that the policy when Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura ran the temple? I understand that he at one time was the main administrator. (loud crashing of thunder)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you don't take simply Jagannātha temple. There are many other temples, they allow. It is a particular management body, they do not allow. But that is not the sanction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is not the sanction. Suppose in your private house you make some private law. That is your business. But actually temple is open for everyone. That is stated. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even one is born of low-grade family, he can accept. There is no injunction. That is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> But there are rascals who do not follow. They have their own imagination. That is another thing. Kṛṣṇa never said that "Only the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> or Indians or Hindus can take shelter of Me." Kṛṣṇa never said. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ,</span> whatever he may be. There is no restriction. Just like Ganges water, anyone can take bath. It is not that only a particular person or particular community can take bath. Anyone can take, and he becomes purified. There is an example, <span class="Italic">na hi harate jyotsnā candraś caṇḍāla veśmani.(?)</span> When there is moonlight, there is no discrimination that here is a <span class="Italic">bhaṅgi's</span> house, <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span>'s house, there should be no moonshine. The moonshine is open in the palace of the king or in the house of a <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla, na hi harate jyotsnā candraś caṇḍāla veśmani.</span> So Kṛṣṇa's mercy is for everyone. It is not restricted to a certain community or class of people, no. Anyone can take advantage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And that is, practically they are doing. Therefore in India, so they say that I am killing Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> that Bhaktivedanta Swami <span class="Italic">hindu-dharma ka naṣṭa.</span> This is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> That is not true.</div>

He asked me "Get out, go to America." So I came. At the age of seventy years, actually nobody goes out of home. But Kṛṣṇa asked me, "Get out and go." So I came. And although I have got the best temple in Vṛndāvana, I cannot live there. But a fighting soldier is honored by the government. He maybe dies, he is recognized by the government, "Here is a soldier, laid down his life by fighting." So we prefer that life. We shall die fighting with <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> It is said in <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that it is better to go out and find salvation for others than to find salvation for yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who seeks salvation for others, he's already salvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, how he can arrange salvation for others? So he hasn't got to seek for salvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> How these devotees are finding salvation for others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are already in the platform of salvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Through them, you are working for the salvation of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the injunction, that first of all you become perfect, then try to make others perfect. So anyone is actually trying to do perfection for others, he is already perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> The devotees are working for the salvation for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's already perfect. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> The one who's trying for others' salvation... That is a devotee's business. Ordinary man cannot do it. Because he's doing that, it is to be understood that he's already on the platform of... Because salvation means to remain his own position. <span class="Italic">Muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<span class="Italic">. Svarūpa</span> is to serve God. So if one is serving on behalf of God, then he's in <span class="Italic">svarūpa, mukti.</span> Others are acting for his own benefit, but a devotee is acting for others' benefit. Therefore he's already on the platform of liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, should I have resigned my membership with the Christian organization? Should I have? I did. Could I serve Kṛṣṇa just as well and also through a Christian? I don't see how I could.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't say like that. (laughs) Christian, actually one who is Christian, he's as good as Vaiṣṇava. A Christian means he recognizes God is great. So we also accept God is great. Where is the difference? God is great in all circumstances. So if anyone accepts God is great, that is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's what the church board said to me. They said, "You believe in Kṛṣṇa, we believe in God. Why do you go? What's superior?" I feel that your knowledge is superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is that sometimes we Indians come to Western country for better education. The university in India or the university in U.S. or in Europe is the same, but why does he go after Indian university education to foreign university? Why does he go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. God is there, the dictionary is there. Sometimes pocket dictionary, sometimes big national encyclopedia dictionary. The Christians, they have no idea what is God. They believe in God, but if you ask them what is God, who is God, they cannot say. But we can say. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman guest (2):</span> It is not as good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you want more knowledge about God, then you must come to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's how I believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman guest (2):</span> Is it not as good to serve God as a Christian in a church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is have already explained, that you serve God in any position, but if you want to know about God more, then you have to come here. Now ask any Christian what is God, who is God, what is His form, what He is doing. Can he answer? Nobody can answer. He knows God is great. How great He is, who is that God, they cannot answer. To some extent it is all right, but if you want to know full extent, then you have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "Two plus two is equal to four" is mathematics, but if you want to know higher mathematics, you have to go some higher college. "Two plus two" is also mathematics, is it not? Everyone knows two plus two equal to four. So when you go to higher university, that "two plus two" does not change, but you know more about it. Because one has gone to higher university, the previous education, "two plus two," has changed, it is not that. But as a Christian you understand God is great, "two plus two," but how He is great, that you have to learn in the <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span> That is real education. Because you do not know how He is great, therefore you do so many sinful activities. Otherwise, how it is possible to maintain slaughterhouse? Christian doctrine says "Thou shall not kill." But he does not understand; therefore his business has become to kill only. This is the defect. Why you are disobeying the orders of Christ, "Thou shall not kill"? Because you do not understand him properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we don't eat meat in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We didn't know why we didn't. But now I know why, because the animal is a living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God says "Everyone is My son."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> In the Bible, they don't accept that the animals and certain living entities are eternal, are going to go back to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may believe, but that is another thing. You may believe something blindly. Come to philosophy, come to science. Because you believe something, it is a fact-that is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> But they base that belief on their scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> The Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is that belief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Can you explain it? That there are certain people, they'll be resurrected from the dead at the time of the coming of the Lord and others will not, or something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, from my knowledge, I never knew that anyone but the human being would be resurrected. Now that's a point where the animal will be resurrected. I didn't know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They think that transmigration only applies to human beings. Or in fact they don't even accept transmigration. They think that you've just got one lifetime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Transmigration for everyone. The Darwin's theory, evolution, it is like that, transmigration. The living soul is changing bodies, that's a fact. We can experience in our own life. The child is changing body to boyhood. The boy is changing his body to youthhood. So therefore it's a fact. The living entity is there within the body, and the body is changed. This simple truth they cannot understand. When a child grows up to become a boy, so what is the change? The change is body. But everyone knows the same child has become boy. Is it not? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, when you leave this planet you go to sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is another thing. Studying, that a child is grown to become a boy, he has changed his body. Does it mean the living entity who was in the child's body is different from the living entity within the boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is a fact that the living entity is eternal and the body is changed. So where is the difficulty to understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> They can understand it, but their scripture doesn't accept reincarnation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you should give up your philosophy and science. That "Because my scripture does not allow me to become educated, I shall remain a fool." (laughter) What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> A beautiful example is where a caterpillar will be, a cocoon will form over a caterpillar, and when the cocoon breaks, it's a butterfly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The living entity changed bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is common sense. If they cannot understand this commonsense affair, then how they are educated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya</span> [Bg. 2.22]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Common sense. And we are practically experiencing. When the child has grown to become a young man, the mother does not cry, "Oh, my child is gone." She knows, she knows that "Here is my child. Simply he has changed his body." So this is a fact, that we are changing bodies but we are eternal. This is the conclusion. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So unless one is properly educated, where is the talk of advancing? So this is the beginning of spiritual education, to understand that the living entity is eternal and the body is changing. And then next question will be that if the body is changing, then this body will be changed, so after my death what kind of body I am going to accept? That is education. That is education. And if I remain blind, I do not care, and next life I become a dog, then what is the value of my present education? In spite of all education, next life I am going to become a dog or tree, then what is the value of my education? That education is not. Throughout the whole world perhaps we are giving this education. Throughout the whole world, find out any institution or university where this education is given. No. Simply big, big talks. And you talk something nonsense and take laureate, Nobel Laureate. That's all. It is going on. Somebody is talking nonsense that life is produced from matter, from chemicals, and if we challenge, "All right, combine some matter in egg form and bring life," that rascal will say, "No, it will take millions of years." And if the bird is giving life in five days, why you are taking doctorate title? Give the chicken doctorate title. The rascals are simply bluffing the people. This is going on in the name of education. Can anyone produce life by a combination of chemicals? And these rascals are advertising. We challenge, "All right, not very big thing. Egg, you can see there is some white substance and yellow substance, and you are very big scientist, you find out what are the chemicals and combine it and put it under legs of the chicken or in the incubator and bring life. Otherwise, why you are talking nonsense and cheating people?" Not only cheating people, people are becoming godless. Everything is science. And the science is this, cheating, that life can be produced by chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> The problem is the definition of life. It has not yet been defined, and the definition of life accepted by them is not the real definition of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The definition of life they have given, resistance. If you want to come to kill me, I resist you. That is life. Everyone knows it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it's a quarter to nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is life. If I want to cut this table it will not resist. But if you want to kill me, I'll resist. That is life. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> No, the way we understand, there is no difficulty. The way scientists understand there is a lot of difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that scientist? What is their definition? What do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Life is a..., they say the question "What is life?" you should not inquire. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is... You keep yourself in darkness. You remain fool. That is scientific. So long you remain a rascal, it is scientific. This is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say it is unscientific question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because they cannot answer you, <span class="Italic">bobā śatru naya.</span> In Bengali, if one is dumb, he has no enemy, but he cannot speak anything. <span class="Italic">Tāvac śobhate mūrkha yāvat kiñcin na bhāṣate mūrkha</span> (?)(Bengali) So <span class="Italic">mūrkha,</span> you remain <span class="Italic">mūrkha,</span> then that is scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Kapila has said (Sanskrit).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So don't ask for life, that is scientific. Do you think it is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> No, as a scientist, I don't believe that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then this is going on. They cannot do anything, and still they are drawing high salary. Especially when they say that life is made of chemicals and they cannot experimentally prove it. How bluffing it is. We say a simple thing, that "Don't talk of big, big life. You just produce from the egg, because egg you require so many chicken to cut their throat. So produce it from chemicals." Why do they not do it? Is anyone to answer this? If life is chemical combination, you see in the egg there is some white substance, some yellow substance, so you analyze and find out what are the chemicals and combine it and color it yellow and pack up in a cellulose cover, and then put it, bring life. Why they cannot do it? Where is the science? Simply talking big, big words? What do you think? Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> What do I think? Well, it's very difficult at this particular time. It hasn't been done yet; it's been claimed, as you say. Yet we as individuals request them to do that, for some reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, unless they do that, what is the use? What is the use of your big, big talking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> He's thinking that sometime they'll do it in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he should not become scientist. The chicken is doing it within five days. (laughter) You transfer your doctorate, laureate to the chicken. You are cheating others. Give the title to the chicken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If and when Kṛṣṇa wants the scientists to come up with the answer, then is when, only when they'll have the answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa has already given to the chicken. (laughter) He's so unfortunate that Kṛṣṇa is not giving him the intelligence. He's so unfortunate. But the fortunate chicken has already got the intelligence. So at least the chicken is fortunate than these so-called scientists. That is our conclusion. He's so unfortunate that he doesn't get the fortune of the chicken. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's a <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> rascal. That's all. He's claiming something which is impossible. That is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> If somebody, if a child, sometimes childish nature, "Mother, give me that moon." It is possible mother can give the moon to the child? So mother cheats him. She gives him a mirror, "You see, here is a mirror, moon here." That's all. But is that moon? So a child may be satisfied with this class of moon, but one who is sane man, his father will not be satisfied. It is impossible. We give this challenge to any scientist, that "You are unnecessarily, uselessly working to produce life from chemicals." That is our challenge. "You cannot do it." (Hindi) So we challenge the so-called scientists that "You rascal, you cannot do it." It is not possible. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> ...this is ninety-six cents, so why put it back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, this is one way of studying, but when you have studied the chemicals, combine them and bring a human life. Science means observation and experiment. Simply observing, analyzing that it is a combination of chemi..., that is not perfect science. When you... This is theory. When you practically bring into action, that is called practical... What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Experimentation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, in science there are two con..., theoretical and practical. So theoretical knowledge is no perfect. When you bring it in practical action, then it is science. In the scientific laboratory, they do not simply theorize; they test it in the laboratory. That is science. If you cannot test it by combination of the chemicals which you have analyzed in your..., then it is failure, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is a scientist. You have not studied properly. That is defect. So why defective knowledge you are declaring as knowledge? That is cheating. When you have perfect knowledge, then you declare. That is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Then you advocate that Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be practiced in every action that you take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything is practice. <span class="Italic">Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā [Bg. </span>8.8]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Scientists at the present time, they say like this because their knowledge is simply illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Real knowledge is covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like this planetary system. So many planets are there. They do not know anything. And they are going to the Mars. They are going to the moon. All bluff. Two things unsolved. They do not know what is life and they do not know what are these planetary system. And still, they are speaking on these two subjects as authority. That is bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So we conclude that without understanding the existence of God, these two problems can never be answered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never be. You hear from God; then you have got perfect knowledge. And if you want to become scientist more than God, then you'll never know it. But their real propaganda is "There is no God." That is their real propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is the root cause of this illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They want to prove "There is no God. Everything is science." However rascaldom it may be, "It is everything." But we are preaching about God. How we can tolerate? We must expose them. That is our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> There's a saying that's printed on a piece of stationery I get from one of my supply houses of a particular piece of equipment this man designs and sells. And on the bottom he indicates, "Somebody has to lead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is a commonsense philosophy, that the earth is there, everything is coming out of earth. As mother is giving birth to so many children, similarly the earth is giving birth to so many children. So the children are there, the mother is there, and where is the father? But these rascals, they say "Without father." Is it possible for the mother to give children without father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> Not legally. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Legally or illegally, there must be some father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> I realize that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Illegally or legally, without connection with the father there is no question of children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Boyd:</span> But even this is being done artificially nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But artificially means that you accept the principle. So therefore we say that here is mother, land, and here is children, the plants, trees, birds, beasts, human beings. They are all coming from the earth. So mother is there, and the children are there. Then where is the father? You cannot say, "No, without father it has come." That is not possible. Then you are talking foolish. There must be father. This is conclusion. So how you can deny God? God is accepted in every religion as the supreme father or something like that, great. And God is there. But they say "Automatically coming" and big, big words. How do they explain? How things are coming from the earth, so many plants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "By chance," just see. Is that explanation? Hmm? If one head is bald-headed, why by chance it does not come again, hair? And these plants and creepers are coming by chance, just see. We have to accept this explanation? (aside:) You sit down. That is for the outsider. So this is explanation by the scientist, "By chance." Just see. How fools they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Chance is their instrument of explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how they are befooling persons. The law is cause and effect. Nothing is chance. There is cause, and there is effect. It is saying the same thing, that "This girl has produced a child by chance." It is not possible. Any sane man knows that she had connection with man, either legally or illegally. It is not chance. So there can... Nothing can happen as chance. That is imperfect knowledge. Wash out. But we know,</div>
