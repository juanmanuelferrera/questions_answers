<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is one (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> No, just a sample. The total height is forty inches. Kṛṣṇa is twenty and Kāliya is another twenty inches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> So I think we could try casting it in bronze.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bronze. Bronze will not be polished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> It is the American or the Western version of the <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-dhātu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Or, not <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-dhātu,</span> but bell metal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be polished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Yes, you can polish very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I've never seen bronze polished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> It depends on the quality, grade. Generally they don't use a very high percentage of brass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You think it's better than brass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> It's a little cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bronze is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I've never seen it highly polished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the problem. Why not make brass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Out of brass? Bronze is harder. Bronze is harder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why harder? You can make softer. Metal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Gold is softer still. It will be much more brilliant in brass than bronze.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Generally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brass, just like our Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities in Māyāpura, how dazzling. Here also, in Boston.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> I think Kṛṣṇa is German silver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Not so much brass casting going on in this country, mostly bronze casting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bronze, but it will not be polished. We want polished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> I have to investigate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bright face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a boy that was in New York who cast some brass Gaura-Nitāi Deities in Australia. They came out very nice. You could talk to him. He might give you some good information. His name is Bhāskara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brass is best, next to gold or silver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> But I think the other Deities we shall just do in concrete, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Lalitā, Viśākhā. Either concrete or hard plaster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Hard plaster, tempered plaster, hydrostone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> They will pay for the casting in Fiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> The Indians in Fiji will pay for the casting if we decide to cast in brass here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone will pay. (laughs) Kṛṣṇa will pay. What will be the cost, let me know. It will be paid by somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> I will have to investigate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You will have it cast or you will cast it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> We'll have it cast here. Actually, one boy is working with me now from Hawaii...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one thing, you can send one copy of this to Vṛndāvana to take casting cost there. They're also doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Estimate. Perhaps they'll be able to do it cheaper in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> They'll definitely be able to do it cheaper in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if they can do cheaper, why not cast there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> The transport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transport is the same. You have to transport from here, they will have to transport from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Hm. Nanda-kiśora, or someone else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You send to Akṣayānanda. (long pause) Prahlāda Mahārāja said there is no necessity for endeavoring for economic development. Very difficult to understand this philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> People don't know how they'll survive if they don't get money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are actual examples. We are not after economic development, but we are after following Kṛṣṇa's instructions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinīkaṇṭha:</span> People criticize us sometimes because they always see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what do we care for them? We go on with our own business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Actually, they are all envious because they see that without working we are getting such nice facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are working, but working for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> I went to the bank the other day to take out some money for the Press, and I took out a few thousand dollars. I had to take it in small bills, and there were <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> there, and they were yelling, "They should be thrown out of town!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes, and they were very angry because they don't make that much money in over two months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Communists also, they are envious of these capitalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The rich. "Make the rich pay," that's their slogan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But the leaders of the Communists are rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The leaders of the Communists are all rich, and the people don't notice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Andha,</span> blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Russia, that, what is that, Communist leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Nikolien? Lenin? Breshnev? Kruschev?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kruschev. Kruschev. He was making money, therefore he was driven out. His son-in-law, his sons were being employed, neopolism, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Nepotism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nepotism. That is human nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They said he was becoming too friendly with the West, getting too many Western ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Kruschev. So they kicked him out. (knock at the door)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Answer the door.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In England, their whole difficulty with the labor.... (several people talk at once, door is open, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> going on)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> It's Govinda dāsī. Tell her to come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But the union problem they have in England, that's why the whole country now is in disruption because the labor is always on strike. They did a survey, and they found out that all the major union leaders are Communists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they're making money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When I was there I remember every month there would be a major strike in the car industry, in the shipping industry, all the major industries there was always a major strike every.... And it would completely devastate the economy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The foreign businesses no longer have confidence in England, because if they make some order maybe it will not be fulfilled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The foreign business no longer has confidence. I heard that England had sold military weapons to Israel, and when Israel was fighting the war they called England, "Immediately send replacements for the weapons." "No, I'm sorry, we are on strike, there's no..., we cannot send replacements." So in this way there is no longer confidence in England for business, international business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Now in South America it has been fashionable.... There are many, many wealthy businessmen living there. So terrorists will kidnap a businessman, and then send a letter to the company in the United States or in that country, stating that "If you do not give us such and such million dollars, we will kill him." So in this way the terrorists are getting millions of dollars by kidnapping big men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> It's happening quite often in South America now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's going on everywhere. There was a, John Paul Getty's nephew in Italy, he was taken by kidnappers, and they petitioned Getty, "Give us so many millions of dollars, otherwise we'll kill your nephew." So he refused. So after a long, long time the nephew was returned somehow or other, and one of the times when they demanded a ransom, they chopped off his right ear and put it in an envelope and sent it through the post: "This is proof that we have your nephew, now give us money." And still he refused. And then eventually the boy was returned minus his ear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And you were saying, Prabhupāda, that even when they have so much money they want more. This man is one of the richest men in the world, and for his own family member he would not pay some money to save him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who was that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Getty. He just died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Just a few days ago he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In England. One of the richest men in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Two of the richest Americans have just died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes was considered the richest man in the country, and they found him dying in a hotel room of malnutrition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He had become so afraid of death that he would wear a mask over his face to avoid germs, and he would be changing his clothes constantly, and he was living terrified of dying and losing his money. So in this way, in his last several years he became mad, just with the fear that he was going to die. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your next publication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Mine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Portuguese and Spanish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In a few days we will be sending to the printer a complete Portuguese <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and Spanish <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book. I think within one week perhaps we will, in one or two weeks, we will send both to the printer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the editorial department?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Here. That's why I'm here. For Spanish and also Portuguese. I just received information that in Caracas they were selling every day one thousand <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Wow!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Each book about two and a half dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means about three thousand dollars daily?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That's very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And they have been defeated by Mexico.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Mexico is selling more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. This month, last month in Mexico they sent in for a month, $23,000 for a month. Now the, all of South America combined this month has almost defeated Rādhā-Dāmodara. (Prabhupāda laughs) Almost on the same level now, South America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This competition must go on. (laughter) That is.... (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 10, 1976, Los Angeles</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his blessing. He wanted; I tried. That's all. Whatever is being done, it is by his desire. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava sata saṅkalpa.(?)</span> Whatever he desires, that is to be fulfilled. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore, full faith in guru, that is the prime factor of success. Not any other things, no qualifications, no education, only strong faith in guru. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau. Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> This is the secret. So whatever little success is there, that was only this qualification, that I wanted to serve him. That's all. Otherwise, there was no business of coming here at the age of seventy years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No one could imagine that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen all my room in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> We looked through the cracks. They're usually not open. Very inspiring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Rādhā-vallabha has one newspaper article when you had just arrived in, I think, Butler.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Trivikrama brought it up last..., two nights ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> When you had just arrived, I think before going to New York, and when you were being interviewed, and it said the Swami is welcoming lectures, and it was very inspiring for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Butler picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another paper was there: "Ambassador of India's culture."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that was the same article, in the <span class="Italic">Butler Eagle</span>. It shows a photograph of you looking through one of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Many times the devotees lament that we could not have been there to help you, because there was so much service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you are helping me. (pause) Who can create such fragrance except Kṛṣṇa? (devotees laugh) Fragrance is coming from here, from the dirt, muddy dirt, and fragrance is coming. Unless there is fragrance, how it came here? The color is coming, the beauty is coming, the fragrance is coming, the arrangement is coming along the stem. Where is that scientist? They are seeing every day, and "There is no God." Just see, how foolish they are. You do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> In the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) That is another bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Post-dated check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if you do in future, what is credit? It is already done by somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're just copying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> They can create fragrance: simply the bad smell of their bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "In future." They're competing with God, and without being success, still: "I am God." What kind of God you are? And foolish men have no sense; they accept such rascals as God. They do not see what is God. How beautiful flowers, how nice arrangement. You cannot manufacture even one fiber, and still you deny God. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> He's speaking, <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10],</span> "Under My supervision everything is being done." And you have got experience that unless one supervises, nothing can be done very nicely. So these things are being done under some expert supervision. This part is green and this part it is red. Two colors are being transferred, transmitted. The flavor is not here, but here. What is this arrangement? There is no brain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Superintelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still the rascals say there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> "Just chance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what a fool they are. Try to expose these fools. But people have lost their reason, brain, everything. Even if we expose, they cannot understand. Still they will stick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> What is their hope?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hope, last hope is to kill them (makes loud sound with hand or instrument).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Chopping off their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kalki-avatāra.</span> No more teacher, saintly. With sword, cut. Finish. Wholesale massacre. Being killed by God, they get salvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Even for doing nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> What kind of salvation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salvation? They realize their spiritual identity. <span class="Italic">Āpana karama, bhuñjāye śamana, kahoye. Karma-phala,</span> result of sinful activities, very, very strong. Prahlāda Mahārāja's prayer... Where is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Which one, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think it is Tenth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> The beginning of the Tenth Chapter is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, what is the first verse? Eighth verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Indriyāṇi manaḥ prāṇaḥ</span> or <span class="Italic">yadi dāsyasi me kāmān</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The Prahlāda Mahārāja's prayer? See this contents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It starts in the Ninth Chapter, his prayers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmādayaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"Prahlāda Mahārāja prayed: How is it possible for me, who have been born in a family of <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> to offer suitable prayers to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Even until now all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā, and all the saintly persons could not satisfy the Lord by streams of excellent words, although such persons are very qualified, being in the mode of goodness. Then what is to be said of me? I am not at all qualified."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go on, second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No purport, translation.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"Prahlāda Mahārāja continued: One may possess wealth, an aristocratic family, beauty, austerity, education, sensory expertise, luster, influence, physical strength, diligence, intelligence and mystic yogic power, but I think that even by all these qualifications one cannot satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one can satisfy the Lord simply by devotional service. Gajendra did this, and thus the Lord was satisfied with him."</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"If a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> has all twelve of the brahminical qualifications [as they are stated in the book called <span class="Italic">Sanat-sujāta]</span> but is not a devotee and is averse to the lotus feet of the Lord, he is certainly lower than a devotee who is a dog-eater but who has dedicated everything-mind, words, activities, wealth and life-to the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee is better than such a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> because the devotee can purify his whole family, whereas the so-called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> in a position of false prestige cannot purify even himself."</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"The Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always fully satisfied in Himself. Therefore when something is offered to Him, the offering, by the Lord's mercy, is for the benefit of the devotee, for the Lord does not need service from anyone. To give an example, if one's face is decorated, the reflection of one's face in a mirror is also seen to be decorated."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "O most powerful, insurmountable Lord, who are kind to the fallen souls, I have been put into the association of demons as a result of my activities, and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of life within this material world. When will that moment come when You will call me to the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the ultimate goal for liberation from conditional life?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Is there a purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. "Being in the material world is certainly miserable, but certainly when one is put into the association of <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or atheistic men, it is intolerably so. One may ask why the living entity is put into the material world. Indeed, sometimes foolish people deride the Lord for having put them here. Actually, everyone is put into conditional life according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja, representing all the other conditioned souls, admits that he was put into life among the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> because of the results of his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> The Lord is known as <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa-vatsala</span> because He is extremely kind to the conditioned souls. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> therefore, the Lord appears when there are discrepancies in the execution of religious principles (<span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata... tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.7]). The Lord is extremely anxious to deliver the conditioned souls, and therefore He instructs all of us to return home, back to Godhead (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]). Thus Prahlāda Mahārāja expected that the Lord, by His kindness, would call him again to the shelter of His lotus feet. In other words, everyone should be eager to return home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus being fully trained in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."</div>

If you want to go to consult a doctor, you have to go thirty miles from your residence. You require doctor, but because you have now car, you have big, big roads. So your doctor, medical consultant, is living thirty miles off. So you have to ride on cars to go to the market, to go to the office, to go to the medical man. So car is required. And as soon as car is there, the accident is there, and there is, power shortage is there, you require big, big roads, so on, so on, so on.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I showed Richard the "Hare Kṛṣṇa People" movie that Yadubara made, and Yamunā <span class="Italic">mātājī</span> made some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> for him to taste. So he's gotten some introduction already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> OK. You came here not too many years ago. Did you ever expect that it would grow into what it has over the years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We came in 1965.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Eleven years ago. And in a relatively short period of time you've managed to gather around you a great number of people. Has it surprised you or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I did not expect. When I came here I did not expect, because we have got so many strictures, so I did not expect that here the people will accept my proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Your proposal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because our proposal is "No sinful life." No more illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxicants. So I did not expect that anyone will accept this proposal. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Are those three sort of proscriptions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Four, sorry. Are they prerequisites to accepting your knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The real thing is.... You can easily understand that "I am not this body; there is a living force within the body." Is it very difficult to understand? This body is not sufficient. The real body means the living force within the body. Is it not? You are talking; what is the difference, you're not talking? Now, if the body is dead, you cannot talk anymore, finished. So what is that force within you that is causing you to talk? Do you know anything about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Have I thought about it, me, personally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Have you ever thought about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What did I think about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um, that I, I've always viewed myself as my self.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Myself, that's what..., you are not this body. You are not.... Body is not yourself. Did you ever think of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, when I say "myself," I should perhaps define it. Myself being all that I can recall being before, as well as my present, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you distinguish between a dead man or living man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um, well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The living man is important, but the dead man is not important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Not his physical body, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then within the physical body, there is something which is making him living man. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the dead man? Something is missing; therefore it is dead. Otherwise the body is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right. Okay. His ability to, to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Body is.... The same hands, legs, mouth, eyes, ears, hair, everything is there, but now they're crying, "Oh, Mr. such and such gone, oh, finished." What is that finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, his ability to share...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that ability? That is my question. Why this important man is now useless although the same hands, legs, mouth, everything is there, but it is useless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, he's no longer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the important thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> The important thing was his ability to share physically and intellectually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that means that important thing was within the body; now it is missing. That is distinction between dead man and living man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> As far as I'm concerned that's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very important thing. This nice body can work on account of presence of that important thing. Otherwise, useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are preaching about that important thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Isn't that the object of all philosophies, both personal and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the real philosophy. You must take care of the living force within the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, and aren't there many ways that you can do that, aren't there many approaches...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, let us understand the importance of that living force. Then we shall find out means how to keep it fit. People are not aware of this living force. They accept this dead body as important. That is material civilization. They are taking care of the body but not the living force which is making this body important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> And you think that is a problem with...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted. Education means to understand that, what is the important thing within this body. Otherwise, cats and dogs, they are also working with the bodily concept of life. The dog is jumping, barking. He's thinking, "I'm dog, I'm this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, as far as nurturing the body through knowledge, is the goal of what you teach to eliminate obstacles in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> That is the goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is aimed at to eliminate obstacles. Now, so far the body is concerned, there are so many obstacles. Everyone is struggling hard, that is for struggle for existence, to get out of the obstacles. Whole struggle for existence is to save ourselves from the obstacles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right. How do you determine what's an obstacle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Obstacles, the ultimate obstacle is that you don't like to die, but you can die any moment. This is greatest obstacle. Why don't you think of it? You are sitting here, you are young man. So you may die immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the greatest obstacle. You have got so many plans to do in your life, but you can die any moment. Is it not obstacle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> The presence of death or the possibility of death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um, to me, I don't think really it is, for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why not? You don't like to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I don't think.... That doesn't bother me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It bothers. Suppose you have got some plan you have to do-everyone has got some plan, ideas, some improvement-but what is the guarantee that you'll be able to execute that plan? Because you can die at any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, there is none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is not obstacle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that, is not obstacle? You are planning something, that "I shall do this..." You may not be very important man, but there are many important men. The leaders of the society, they are planning that "I shall make my nation like this way, my family like this way." Everyone is planning. But where is the guarantee that he'll be able to fulfill the plan? Death may take place any moment. So is it not obstacle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Hm. I really don't view it as an obstacle, the fact that my plans may be altered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not. You may not, but we have got personal experience that people do not want to die until he fulfills some, his brainwork plan. I have seen. One, my friend, he was dying, he was at that time fifty-four years old only, and he was begging the doctor, "My dear doctor, medical man, can you not give me four years time only, I can fulfill my plan?" He was very big businessman, so he was planning something to do, but doctor said that "You cannot survive." So he was begging the mercy of the doctor, "Doctor, can you not give me at least four years time?" As if the doctor can give him life. He was feeling this is obstacle: "I'm going to die without fulfilling my plan." I think that psychology is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But, but generally, how can...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not be afraid of, but generally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Generally, how can you determine an obstacle...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I've seen it, I've seen it, that he was begging the doctor, "Please give me four years life. Give me some medicine so that I'll live at least for four years, I'll finish my plan." I've seen it. You are the first man that you are not afraid of death (devotees laugh), but I see everyone is afraid of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see. As soon as there is immediately siren, I've seen it, also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Are you afraid of death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. My position is different, because I know I'm not going to die. My position is different. Because we are confident, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are not going to die. Death is no question for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Umhm. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we are not afraid of death. That is another thing. But generally, people, they are actually. Are you not afraid of disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I would not wish to be in great pain or agony, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is pain, as soon as you are in disease, there is great pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Uh, yes, but there are quick deaths and there are slow deaths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Everyone is afraid of this. Are you not afraid of old age and invalidity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Not particularly. I mean, it's a part of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are liberated. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda said you are liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I'm what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally, everyone, that is the problem of life. Otherwise, why there are so many medical colleges, drug shops and medicines, just to avoid disease? Otherwise, there was no need of arrangement. Everyone is afraid of disease, not to suffer from disease. That's a fact. If you say that you are not afraid of disease, that is something new. But unless we are afraid of disease, why there is this Memorial Hospital, this drug shop, this pharmacy? Why these things are required? We don't want it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Do you...? You have a doctor, though, you said, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not a doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> You have no doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is that these are the problems-birth, death, old age and disease. This is our point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> That these are the basic problems of most men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Death, fears of death and disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> You too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone, I am everyone also. I am also, I have taken up my translation work, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> So I am trying to live at least up to the time I finish my translation. That is also.... I do not wish to die before I finish. That is also.... Everyone is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But what happens if you do die before you finish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, you are talking something extraordinary. Everyone has got some ambition, and he wants to do it, and death, disease, old age, these are impediments. That is the point. No one wants to die premature death. Family man, a family man wants to see that his sons are properly educated or they are well-placed, so on, so on, so many things. And if all of a sudden death comes, he becomes sorry, that "I could not finish my business." Therefore death is impediment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> You were widely respected in India before you came to the United States?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why bring that question? First of all, let us finish this question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No, no, I'm getting to it. Ah, if you had died before you had come to the United States, would that have been a tragedy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, that would have been a big tragedy for all of us. That is premature. That's the example Prabhupāda is giving. If a man wants to educate his sons, but he dies before they can be educated, then, to him, that is a premature death. So therefore he does not want that. In fact he's afraid: "Please, I don't want to die before I see my sons educated." So that is a fear of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore death is an obstacle. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> An obstacle to the goals of his life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who has no responsibility, that is another thing. But a responsible man wants to finish the responsibility, and if death comes before that, that's an obstacle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um hm. Okay. Ah, how about smaller obstacles in life, though, than death? I mean this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the major obstacles, and subordinate to these obstacles there are hundreds and millions of obstacles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> There are millions of obstacles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the main obstacle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, right, okay. But I mean, okay, you say most people are, almost everyone, except me perhaps, is concerned about death. Ah, but how about the smaller obstacles which nevertheless can make people very depressed, neurotic? How do you recognize and live with them or eliminate them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our point is there are hundreds and millions of obstacles. If they are, I mean to say, summarized, they become birth, death, old age and disease. This is my point. There are hundred and thousands of obstacles, but if you take all of them and make a summary, then it comes four-birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He wants to know, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if these are the obstacles, how do we Kṛṣṇa conscious people deal with these obstacles or eliminate these obstacles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we are doing by Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because if we try to understand Kṛṣṇa, simply by understanding Him, I am going to get a life which will be free of all obstacles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> And how do you do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you see what we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> By living this type of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, what about the people who don't live here at the <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> people who live, if you want to call it, the outside world, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not getting the opportunity. We are giving the opportunity. You come here and live here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> This is the only way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Living in an <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not living..., to take the philosophy. Follow the policy or process; then your life is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like our householders, they have their apartments, but they're always associated with Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we are writing so many books to give them enlightenment. This is the process. It is an educational movement, how to overcome these obstacles. That is the sum and substance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Do you think there are any other ways which are equally effective?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Isn't the spiritual benefit that people in the <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> here get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you must know what is spirit. They do not know even what is spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, okay, there are many contented people in the world, there are many people who are at peace with themselves...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Contented-ass is contented. He has no problem. The best-contented living being is an ass. He has no complaint. So that is not civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> That is not what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not civilization, or life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, but being able to live with your limitations and be therefore content, ah, within those limitations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I already said, that animal lives very content within his limitation. He doesn't like to improve. But that is not human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, okay, ah, but I know many people who are relatively contented and still growing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the contentment? If you have got the problems unsolved, that is ass's contentment. Ass does not know how to check death. He does not think of it. But a human being's intelligence says whether the disease can be checked, whether the death can be checked. That is human being. The ass cannot think. If we remain contented like an ass, so that is animal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, but still people carry on, people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them carry on. Ass is also carrying on. That is another thing. But distinction between ass's life and human life, the ass cannot estimate the impediments or the obstacles of life. A human being can see, and it is his duty how to overcome it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Pardon me while I get that down. Um, yeah, okay, I guess what I'm saying then is that I know many people who do not live in <span class="Italic">āśramas,</span> who will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not advising that you live in <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> but.... Just like here is an.... You see, McGill University. So they are giving permanent order of our books. So the university authorities, they are not coming to our <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> but they'll get the benefit by reading our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right. Okay. But I know people who have not had the benefit of reading your books, and yet, as far as I know, and I've gotten to know them very well, they seem to be living lives which, for them, work. The obstacles they can cope with, and I guess what I'm saying, or advancing, is that perhaps the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many men who do not go to the university and live peacefully. But that does not mean university is useless. Similarly, many men may not come to us, that does not mean this institution is useless. It has its importance for the serious men, not for the asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, but do you think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like this university, they are serious for education, and they are ordering our books. Others may not order; they are not reading. That means they are not serious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Only the people who are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Knowledge is for the intelligent class of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But there are many types of knowledge, and there are many ranges, depths of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many types, this is also one type of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, it is not the only type, that's what I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are different aims also. If you are interested to become an expert medical man, then the knowledge is different. If you want to become an engineer, the knowledge is different. Similarly, if he wants to overcome all the obstacles, then this is the education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the final.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What about other religions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other..., you become interested in medical, you become a medical man, you become an engineer, you become other.... You take that education. But one who is interested to stop all obstacles of life, this is the only education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> This is the only one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Have you studied other religions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore I'm saying. Without studying, how can I say? I am challenging, not saying. We are challenging. We are not saying only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to overcome all obstacles of life, this is the only education. That's all. Or if you have different aims of life, there are different departments of knowledge. But if you want this knowledge, then this is the education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> According to you, this is the only spiritual knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What you write about and have studied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What would you classify, ah, other works, say, the Koran or the Bible or any other religious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well they are also aiming to this aim of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> They are in the same aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But do you think they are successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are successful if they follow the education. Just like Christ, he's speaking of kingdom of God. So if you follow Christ, there is hope that you go to kingdom of God. But if you don't follow, you simply rubberstamp, "I am Christian," then it is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But there are other...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are of the same type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Yes, but do they have any value as far as you are concerned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, they have value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, that's what I was trying to get at.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda meant that the other branches of knowledge outside of our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, yes, right, I wasn't talking about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That was mis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, I wasn't talking about a technical or secular knowledge at all. I was talking about other spiritual philosophies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Any science, any knowledge who is trying to give enlightenment about God, there is the same line as we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, but those people who study say, okay, to use an example, the Pope. Now there is a man who has dedicated his whole life, publicly, personally, spiritually, however you define it, to Christianity, specifically to the Catholic Church. Now apparently, and for all intents and purposes, his life seems to work for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is, the Catholic Church is the original Church, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> The original Christian Church, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why there are so many varieties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now hundreds and thousands of churches are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right. Other people find that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they don't like Catholic Church. They don't like. So they are missing the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Of the Catholic Church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> True, I agree. But is the point of the Catholic Church the only point that's to be made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you accept Christianity, then the Catholic process, I think-I do not know-that is only way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But is the point that the Catholic Church makes the only point to be made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Catholic. I mean to say, any church original, authoritatively, that is genuine. If you deviate from that, then you cannot claim to that school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's an example that if the Catholic Church is presenting the teachings of Jesus as it is, and then later on other churches deviate a little, then to deviate from the teachings of Jesus is bad, and to stick strictly to the teachings of Jesus is the only way, in Christianity. That's the idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Yes, but the goal is similar in Christianity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The goal cannot be similar. If you deviate, the goal is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No, no.... The.... Okay, the goal generally is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question. Goal is one, so if you deviate, then you go away from the goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, but the goal seems to me, as I have studied Christianity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> The goal of Christianity is to make a better life here on earth for the followers of Christ and after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. That is our preaching also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> That's your goal also. Okay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a student is being trained up in medical college, and when he becomes practitioner, the same thing. There is no change. There is no change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Yes, I think you are talking about specific...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this is.... Take Christian religion. So going to the church, it is practicing how to establish relationship with Christ and God. So after death, if he's perfect, he goes back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um hm, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is practice. If one is interested in going back to home, back to Godhead, then this is the only way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, let me just say something, and then, you know, like, you can take it however you want. It seems to me that there all through life, men, all through history, men have been more or less striving for this same general goal-happiness here and here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, same general goal.... You must speak.... If you say same general goal, everyone says, "This is also general goal, this is also general goal." You must specifically mention what is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, that goal is happiness here on earth, and however you define happiness, security, well-being, food on the table, however you want to, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if somebody says that "I don't require to go to church for happiness. I find happiness by drinking. Let me go to the brothel and drink," that is also happiness. You cannot say. How can you say, "I don't care to go to the church. I am getting happiness here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I'm thinking of it in a larger sense than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Happiness must be happiness. It doesn't mean that because larger accepts something happiness, that is happiness. No. Happiness must be real happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, what do you define as real happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One may like it or not like it, that is not the question. Happiness is real happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right. Okay, that's what I'm talking about, spiritual happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you simply say happiness, if you do not explain what is real happiness, then somebody will say, "I'm feeling happiness by drinking here. Why you are asking me to go to the church? You go, I don't go." That's all. Then you have to explain what is real happiness. Whether that real happiness is obtainable by going to the church or going to the brothel, liquor house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, I don't think that any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't think, but he thinks that "Here is happiness." You cannot induce him. He thinks. Just like few minutes ago you said that there is no obstacle, but we think there is obstacle. There is different thoughts. They don't care what is God, what is.... "I don't want to know what is God. I'm getting happiness," finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, but continuing, you know, continuing, people are, okay.... People I think are basically the same in many respects as far as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is wrong. That is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> That is wrong. Okay, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see. I have already explained. One is getting happiness by drinking, and one is getting happiness by going to the church. You cannot say that they are the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well I think they're the same in intent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what do you mean by that? First of all, describe what is happiness, whether drinking is happiness or going to the church is happiness. Therefore you have to define what is happiness. Then we have to select whether this happiness is obtainable in the liquor shop or in the church. You must have clear idea of happiness. And if you speak generally, then he will say, "I am getting happiness; why you are insisting me go to the church? I am getting happiness." Therefore you have to define what is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, I would say happiness is the pursuit of, to you, what makes your life work, worthwhile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not working, we are not interested in working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, when I say work, I mean what gives you an inner respect for yourself, um, yeah, I think it all boils down to self-respect, an appreciation of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this self-respect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Self-respect? Self-respect would be an appreciation and cognizance of your spiritual and physical being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is my actual being? Physical being or spiritual being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Both. I mean they are part of, to me, they are one manifestation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And after death what happens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Do I feel personally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I think everyone has different ideas. There are many different ideas about what happens after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have to know what is reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What is reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have to know what is reality. Simply ideas will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, reality I would say is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you do not know, how you will say? You say that you do not know, but how you will say, if you do not know what is reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, I know what reality is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Reality is a series of moments or a moment perceived by the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained. The drunkard is feeling by drinking his senses are very satisfied, that is reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Sure, it's his reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then why should you canvass him, "Please come to the church and accept Christianity"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Frankly, I don't know. I don't really know why he should be asked to go to church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore.... Then there is no need of church. Everyone can do whatever he thinks reality. That is no standard reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No, reality is not in itself a goal. It just is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I would say, you know, we discussed this earlier, it's a, it's trying to find what makes one's life worthwhile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trying to find, that means you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No, I think life is a pursuit, I don't think it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that pursuit if you have no aim or objective? You are going to school, the object is you become a graduate. If you do not know what is the ultimate goal, what is this pursuit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Why pursue something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are going to school, college, suppose you are going to be graduate, but if you do not know what is the ultimate end of pursuit, then what is this pursuit? Simply blind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No, it's, it's just trying to make your life work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be some goal, ultimate goal. That we must know. That is called pursuit. If you do not know what is the ultimate goal of life, then there is no meaning of pursuit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Um.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda is talking about an absolute reality, not a relative reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What is your definition of an absolute reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is final.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> A goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, and what is the absolute reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Relative means it is understood in two ways. Absolute means there are no two ways, final. Final. So what is the final aim of our life? That we must know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, we know, everyone, all of our students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> What is that absolute reality that is the absolute goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The absolute goal is to understand that within this body there is a living force which is spiritual, and that spiritual force is a servant of God. It has a relationship with God. Apart from how you perceive the world through your senses, beyond that there is a soul which has a relationship with God. That is the absolute reality. You may perceive the world in so many ways through your senses, but beyond that, within your body there is a soul which is yearning for a relationship, a loving relationship with God. And if you neglect that relationship due to your senses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...or ignorance, then you're missing the reality of life and you're living in an illusion. Due to your senses you're living, you could live, be living in illusion. The senses are not perfect instruments for understanding reality. There is another process for understanding reality. The senses are not perfect. Therefore one should not depend upon the senses to understand reality. There is a greater process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> And how is that found?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You find out this verse: <span class="Italic">sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyaṁ grāhyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What's the second word, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sukham ātyantikam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad<br class="calibre2"/>buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam<br class="calibre2"/>vetti yatra na caivāyam<br class="calibre2"/>sthitaś calati tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.21]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's combined with some other verse. "The stage of perfection is called trance, or <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> when one's mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This is characterized by one's ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks that there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position one is never shaken even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Purport. "By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle, and after this one becomes situated in trance, or <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> which means that the yogi realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Patañjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation. But they do not understand the real purpose of the Patañjali system of yoga<span class="Italic">.</span> There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patañjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure realized through transcendental senses is accepted, and this is corroborated by the Patañjali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his <span class="Italic">Yoga-sūtras: puruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.</span> This <span class="Italic">cit-śakti,</span> or internal potency, is transcendental. <span class="Italic">Puruṣārtha</span> means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This oneness with the Supreme is called <span class="Italic">kaivalyam</span> by the monist. But according to Patañjali, this <span class="Italic">kaivalyam</span> is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This clearance is actually liberation, or <span class="Italic">bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.</span> The theory of <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa</span>-also preliminary-corresponds with this principle. In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> this is called <span class="Italic">svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also confirms this situation in this verse. After <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa,</span> or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the words of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ:</span> this is the real life of the living entity. <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original, eternal position of the living entity. Patañjali also accepts this by his words <span class="Italic">kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.</span> This <span class="Italic">citi-śakti,</span> or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtras</span> as <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> This natural, transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga</span> will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>." Should I keep reading Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Should I continue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is still there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There is another page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> called <span class="Italic">samprajñāta-samādhi</span> and <span class="Italic">asamprajñāta-samādhi.</span> When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called <span class="Italic">samprajñāta-samādhi.</span> In the <span class="Italic">asamprajñāta-samādhi</span> there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yogi is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yogi is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today's so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yogi indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yogis who are attracted by the <span class="Italic">siddhis,</span> or perfections, in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If the yogis are attracted by the by-products of yoga<span class="Italic">,</span> then they cannot attain the stage of perfection as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way. The best practice of yoga in this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing <span class="Italic">haṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yoga,</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga,</span> but there is no such problem in executing <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences-such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative-but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, āgamāpāyino nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.</span> He endures all such incidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Did you write..., you wrote the purport? Okay, um, when you said the person who is involved with Kṛṣṇa consciousness makes the best use of a bad bargain, were you referring to life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> This physical life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Physical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The physical life is struggle for existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Is a struggle for existence. Why is...? Why, if a man who is an alcoholic, if that's the best that he can make of life, why is that bad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not.... He's wrongly, he's going in the wrong path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, if that's the best that he can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> He can change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he can change. Change is possible, but if he sticks, that is his selection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Ah, but suppose drinking to him is better than what he has to put up with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not actual fact. Drinking, nobody can be happy by drinking. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, okay. You said in the purport that tragedies of life-I'm paraphrasing-tragedies of life such as death of even a close relative are mere incidental occurrences. Is...? But you said earlier that death to you was anything but a mere incidental occurrence, that it was the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not irresponsible to the death. Death, although we have to meet death, we are making provision that after death we become happy. Happy, of course, for us, even in living condition or dead condition, there is happiness, but it will take time to understand. But taking superficially, death is not very pleasing, so after death, that is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bha.... Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> we do not get again a material body. This is final. The material body is the cause of pains and pleasure. So if you don't get the material body, if you remain in your spiritual body, that is real enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But then why do you fear this death of the physical body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I do not fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, you don't?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The ordinary man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well, I don't either, and I'm not in Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, because you do not know that you are risking your life without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the.... You do not, that I have already said, that an innocent person doesn't know what is going to happen, but things are going to happen. That you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> After death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you must be aware what is going to happen after death. Then if you become fearless, that is secure. But without knowing, if you are not afraid, that is risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, are you familiar with the writings of Descartes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't read anyone's books except <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, I thought you said you studied other philosophies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Study, there are so many books we study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, okay, well anyway, there was a French philosopher in the 1700's named Rene Descartes, and his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think we have discussed this philosopher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> You have discussed him? All right, one of the things he said was that.... Oh, I'm sorry, it's Pascal. Anyway, same thing practically. Ah, he said that as far as an afterlife goes, as far as proving it, it's impossible to prove it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why impossible? He does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can prove immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, but it's just a wager, it's a moot argument, the proofs are of a spiritual kind rather than a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It requires little brain; otherwise, it can be proved immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Pardon me, I didn't catch the last part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, that the spirit soul is there, that can be proved immediately provided one has brain to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> How do you prove that a spirit is dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very easy. Just like you are a young man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda said "spirit is there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, oh, I misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not that" spirit is dead." Spirit is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Oh, oh. I misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just try to, try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like when you have a very..., when you were first born, you had a very small body. Now you are older. So where is that small body? It is no longer existing. Now you are in a young man's body. So similarly, when you are sixty years old, the body that you have now will no longer exist, but you still exist. Even though your body has changed, your life goes on. In other words, life is not dependent on the body. The body changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Yes, but you still have a body at sixty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Death is another change of body. Life will go on. The example of life going on even though you are changing your body, you are experiencing within this one life. You've already experienced that your life goes on even though you have changed your body so many times. So death is simply another change of body. You have already experienced that you can exist even though you have quit one body and gotten a new body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the point is that you are going to get another body. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> How do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what kind of...? This is a fact, just like you have got already another body. Where is that child's body, where is that boy's body? That is finished. This is the proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But I'm still alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alive, you are always alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Physically alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, physically not. Spiritually, you are always alive. This point is to be understood. The death taking place only of the physical body. That you have to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, but I have never been aware of any proof...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is education. You are not aware because you are not educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Perhaps, but I have never read of anyone else actually proving that there is a spiritual afterlife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is the proof, he is giving proof. Therefore I said it requires little brain. He's giving proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I think it requires more than education; it requires faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The first question Prabhupāda asked is what is the difference between a dead man and a living man. The body is the same, but something is missing in the dead man, in the dead body. So that is the proof that the body is not living at any time, but there is a living energy, and when that living energy is inside the body, it makes the body seem alive, and if that living energy is taken out of the body, then the body is seen as it really is, a lump of matter. The body is never alive; it is the presence of the soul within the body that animates the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, animate, that's the etymology of animation, <span class="Italic">anima,</span> soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So your body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I agree with all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And that living energy is eternal, and when this body becomes an old man's body, or rather when you get an old man's body, the body you have now will be finished, but you will still be alive because you are that eternal living energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, and what I am saying is that I have, there has never been any empirical proof of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But I have already explained that these senses are not the perfect instruments for experiencing reality. Just like sometimes there may be a cloud, and therefore you cannot see the sun with your senses, but that does not mean the sun is not there. It simply means your senses are not powerful enough to see. The senses are imperfect instruments for perceiving reality. The sun is always there, but sometimes you can see it and sometimes you can't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like night, this is night, you don't see the sun. That does not mean there is no sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Don't rely on empirical sense perception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, right, you're introducing here though, the essence of all religion, and that is faith. Faith...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's not faith, it is fact. If I say that there is sun and you cannot see, if you deny, "No I don't see. There is no sun," so which is fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Well there is no sun now. There's no sun present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun is there. You cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right now, the sun, in my life, is not present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is present, that is ignorance. You just phone immediately to Bombay, "Is there sun?" He'll say, "Yes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Is the sun out in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I have faith that it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No faith, it is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> It is a fact, not to me though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then you are not very intelligent. You phone your friend that "Where is the sun?" He'll say "It is above my head."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right now, the sun is not above my head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not your head, but you phone to your friend in Bombay, he'll say "Yes, here is sun." But that does not mean you believe in the sun existing. That's not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> No, that's not what I'm talking about. You asked me whether the sun was above my head now, and I said no it is not, but that does not mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Head or not head, sun is there, but you cannot see. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda is explaining the existence of the sun is not dependent upon your perceiving it through your senses. The sun is always there, but sometimes you perceive it and sometimes you don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't perceive. That is your position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right. That is because I am physically limited by my body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the point. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But I still don't see that as an affirmation nor as a denial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore this verse is explained to you, <span class="Italic">sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyaṁ grāhyam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we have to understand through supersenses, not this blunt senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, and I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> And I think that in the Western world, I don't know about the Eastern world, in the Western world, that understanding is called faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, what Prabhupāda is explaining is.... Just like now you are seeing me through your blunt senses. By the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you awaken a different type of senses, called transcendental senses, and it is just as real as the blunt sense perception, except it is perfect sense perception, whereas your physical senses are conditioned, limited. There are transcendental senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Yes, but all the input goes into the mind, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, these are actual sense perceptions. "The soul is sentient, thou has proved."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like your body has senses, the soul also has senses, and the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and taking the spiritual <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> seeing the Deity in the temple and hearing this Vedic knowledge, that awakens the soul, and thus you can experience the sense perception of the soul, the knowledge of God through the soul, sense perception. You can see God, when you're very pure. And that's a fact, not faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are five stages of ascending to come to the right conclusion. This, this is.... Just like <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa,</span> directly, you do not see the sun on the sky, but the same example, if you phone your friend, "Where is the sun?" then he'll say, "Yes, here is the sun." So this is called <span class="Italic">parokṣa,</span> mean you get the knowledge by other sources. Your direct sources, you cannot see, but you get from other sources, you understand, "Yes, sun is there in the sky."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> And I have faith that it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must have faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I trust that it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, I was listening to him and, you know, I'm hearing a lot, okay, the brain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean to say, there are five stages, <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa, parokṣa, aparokṣa, adhokṣaja</span> and <span class="Italic">aprākṛta.</span> So our process should be to go to the <span class="Italic">aprākṛta,</span> transcendental knowledge. This is the stages. Just like.... This is explained. We can directly understand that by directly, I'm seeing there is no sun, but when I ask my friend, he says there is sun. So this is also knowledge. This is called <span class="Italic">parokṣa</span> knowledge, from other sources. Similarly, there are stages. So when the perfect stage is, that is <span class="Italic">aprākṛta,</span> no more material, all spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay. The brain, the mind, interprets the senses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, the brain, mind, they are instruments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, they interpret the senses. Right. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are instruments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Now if the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if you see with your eyes, and then you see with microscope, then you see with telescope, different processes. Yes. But you see with your spiritual eyes, that is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Now suppose the brain dies, as in the case...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brain dies.... Brain is part of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, it's a part of the body. It can fail just as the heart or the lungs or anything else. Now suppose the brain dies, the soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You get another brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You get another brain. Suppose, just like you are working with the glass, spectacle, it breaks, you get another spectacle. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> In the same body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, now Karen Ann Quinlan, you know her?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't know anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, this is a, let me explain very briefly. Here is a girl in New Jersey, near New York, whose brain has died through a traffic accident. Her body is still alive. Her body is still alive, but her brain is dead, she cannot get up, speak, move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is already explained, the brain is an instrument. The instrument is not working, but that is not death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Right, her soul is still alive, is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Her soul is still alive, and she is still functioning spiritually, even though her brain is dead. Is that what...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is possible because soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The soul is always alive, but the fact that she's being maintained means the soul's still in that body, has not left the body yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, now what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The soul is always living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, now what is.... Is the soul in a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another proof. That instead of, in spite of the brain is not working, the soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, but just let me finish this, and then we'll leave it. The.... Okay, how am I going to say this? Is her spiritual, is her spirit in a less active state from when her brain was alive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit is always active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> It's always active at the same level?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not same level, because you are understanding the spirit through the body. So body is changing. Just like the soul, when he's in the boy's body, it is talking so many nonsense things. But you don't take it seriously. But when you are grown up, if you talk such nonsense things, then you'll be taken as a nonsense, because the body has changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay, what I was leading up to was, her brain is dead, she has no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not dead, it is not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> It's not working, okay. It's not working. She's getting no sensory input. She's not aware of the physical surroundings, and yet you maintain that her soul is still alive and still very active. Now would her state, her physical state, enhance the soul's activity or detract from...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has nothing to do with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> It has nothing to do with it. Okay, would it matter to you whether they did turn off her life supporting apparatus? Would that make any difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, it wouldn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are machines that are maintaining her life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like a person in a car, the car engine may fail and the person may get out of the car or he may linger in the car. The car is just a machine. So the soul is lingering in her body. Even though it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> But it's still very active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, just like if my car breaks down, that does not mean I have broken down. I'm the passenger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Can't she be in touch with her soul in a coma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She is soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> She is soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That personality, that is the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, when the machine, when the conscious, when the body is broken like that, she cannot become self-realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> She's active on the mental platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She's covered with the body, but she's different from the body. Just like you are covered by your dress, but you are different from the dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> You are very intelligent boy. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> I don't know what good that does me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very good questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You are very merciful, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> You are very patient, I'll tell you. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thank you, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...even they don't associate temple this and that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That boy has some intelligence, it's just a, (laughs) he has to be guided a little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guidance required. <span class="Italic">Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> (end)</div>
