<div class="Purp-para"></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to stop him for taking another Nobel Prize. Where is? (laughter) I am giving him notes that life is not from matter. Matter is from life. So he is going to write thesis on this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Vedānta-sūtra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the fact. The so-called scientists, they are going on a wrong theory. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ: [Bg. </span>10.8] "I am the origin of everything." So Kṛṣṇa is life. Kṛṣṇa is not dead stone. Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the source of everything." He is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not a dead stone. Then how matter can be the cause of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Matter is caused by life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, matter grows upon life. Just like why this body has grown upon me? I am the spirit soul. This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like, this is... I have explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I am putting on this overcoat. The overcoat is made according to the size of my body, but I am thinking, "I am overcoat." This is foolishness. Just like I got my hand, therefore this overcoat is made of warm cloth. It has got a hand also. Because originally I have got hand, therefore the overcoat has got a hand. Similarly, originally I am spirit soul, I have got my spiritual body, and the material body has grown, cut according to the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about in mineralogy? Scientists have proven that, for example, mountains are growing by sedimentary activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also growing on spirit soul, Supersoul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In the mountain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything. Mountains have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> as the bones of God. These grasses are described as hairs on the body of God. These holes, there are holes, we saw that. They have been described as oceans. So in this way, this <span class="Italic">virāṭ,</span> the biggest body. As the smallest body is producing chemical, similarly the biggest body also, producing chemical. A small tree, lemon tree, how many pounds of the citric acid it is produced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, producing, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if the tree can produce so much chemicals, how much the body of God can produce chemicals, we can imagine only. They are giving the theory that "From these chemicals life begins, or evolution begins." But wherefrom that chemical developed? That they do not know. That explanation is here, Kṛṣṇa: "I am the source."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> or the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book,</span> you state that even clouds have souls. But then again they dissipate, in the rain they dissolve. Does that mean they die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like your body dissolves. Does it mean you die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So that means the life span of a cloud is very minute or very short. Is that so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are many living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, my understanding of the evolution and the transmigration is that evolution is uni-directional, only in one direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Whereas the transmigration can be both, in both directions. They can go up or can go down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Both ways. When you say "trans," "trans" does not mean stereotyped. For lower animals, that is one side, and for human being, both sides. Because after all, the body is made according to your desire. The lower animals, they have got one kind of desire, but the human being, he has got thousands and millions of desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So the platform of transmigration from the human platform, so it works, either it can go down or it can go up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, transmigration (is) going on. They are coming automatically, animals, to the upper level of human form. But when you come to human form, if you don't cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you remain as cats and dog, then you become again cat and dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the evolution stops when the spirit soul reaches the eternal abode in the spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when he is no more entangled by a material body. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The scientists have no information that there is evolution after human platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their rascaldom. Therefore I say they are rascals. They have no knowledge; still, they proclaim they are scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They think that evolution is continuing. They think that the human species will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, evolution... That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ [Bg. 9.25].</span> Progress is going on. That progress, the ultimate progress is <span class="Italic">yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6].</span> That where you're going, you do not return, that is the supreme progress. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ.</span> That is the highest perfection. You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Everything is there. <span class="Italic">Mām upetya kaunteya punar janma na vidyate. Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam, nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> They have no idea what is the highest perfection of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are saying that the material body started from elements, the chemical elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we admit also. That we also admit. But on what basis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And when the spirit soul, when the living entity reaches the human platform, then again goes back to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do the rascals believe in the living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, they don't say living entity. Bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Something akin to Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The Buddhists also say that the body is like a house. You put the house together, you put the body together with chemicals. And when the bodies die, just like you take the house apart, all the wood, and then there is no more house... no more soul, no more life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is called <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa.</span> And with the chemicals you can build another house. Buddhists they do not give any information of the soul. That is Buddhism. What...? Oh, wet? (the ground?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, it's dry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> There's another very interesting factor that scientists, they state that matter is, or that there is, they dispute the fact that there's one soul within the body. There's a special kind of worm, it's an earthworm, that if you cut it in half, both parts will live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So they wonder how is it possible that if there is soul, that there could be two souls within one body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not. Souls takes the opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, it takes the opportunity of the other body, the fertile...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The spirit soul must necessarily have a body, either spiritual or material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got already spiritual body. Material body is his covering. It is unnatural. Real body is spiritual. Just like your coat, this is unnatural. But your real body is natural. Otherwise how transmigration is possible? I am accepting different unnatural bodies. Unnatural means to my constitution. My real constitutional body is servant of Kṛṣṇa. So, so long I do not come to that position, I remain servant of nature and I get so many bodies. According to the nature's direction I am getting body, I am giving it up, again I am desiring something, I am getting another body. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is a rascal. He is thinking, "I am this body." <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati, bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">].</span> This is a <span class="Italic">yantra</span>, machine. And we are traveling many species of life, all riding on this car, given by nature. <span class="Italic">Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā. Māyā</span> has given this vehicle, anywhere wandering, up and down, sometimes demigod, sometimes dog. This is going on. And in this wandering process, if he gets in touch with a devotee, then his real spiritual life begins. Otherwise he has to go on, rotating.</div>
<div class="Verse"><span class="Italic">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva<br class="calibre2"/></span>guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mahāprabhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By mercy of spiritual master, the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, he gets the seed of devotional service, and if he cultivates, then his life becomes successful. Otherwise he has to rotate, sometimes up, sometimes down. Sometimes this grass, sometimes lion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But ultimately if we come to Kṛṣṇa, there's no return. But nevertheless, Jagāi, and..., the two gatekeepers, they returned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is return, that is voluntary. Return there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So we can come to the spiritual world and return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Fall down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As soon as we try, "Oh, this material world is very nice," "Yes," Kṛṣṇa says, "yes, you go." Just like nobody is interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Do you think everyone is interested? So. They want to enjoy this material world. Otherwise what is the meaning of free will? Every living entity has got a little free will. And Kṛṣṇa is so kind, He gives him opportunity, "All right, you enjoy like this." Just like some of our students, Kṛṣṇa conscious, sometimes go away, again come back. It is free will, not stereotyped. Just like one goes to the prisonhouse, not that government welcomes, "Come on. We have got prisonhouse. Come here, come here." He goes out of his free will; again comes out, again goes. Like that. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare, nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> The police is there. Just like the police car was there. We have nothing to do with it. But if you do anything criminal, immediately you will be arrested, under police custody. The <span class="Italic">māyā</span> may be there, but <span class="Italic">māyā</span> captures him who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Therefore, <span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:</span> "Anyone who surrenders unto Me, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> does not interfere anymore."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So our desire to enjoy, we achieve these bodies; and our desire to achieve Kṛṣṇa brings us to our natural position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But then again there's this constant struggle with our lower nature? We are constantly fighting our desires even though we want to serve Kṛṣṇa? This continues?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, like, many devotees, they experience the difficulty that although they sincerely want to love God and serve Him, yet their body is almost like another dictator within them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means he is strongly under the grip of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Even though the desire exists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like a thief, he knows that "If I steal, I will be arrested. I will be put into jail." And he has seen that one thief, he has stolen, he is arrested. Still he commits theft. He knows everything. Why does he commit theft?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda gives the example of the elephant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Takes shower again and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Hasti-snāna.</span> Therefore, knowledge giving, that is the beginning of spiritual life. Kṛṣṇa gives Arjuna, knowledge giving, that "You are not this body." This is the beginning of knowledge. What is that knowledge, all over the world? Where is that university? This preliminary knowledge which Kṛṣṇa begins, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, where is that university? Svarūpa Dāmodara, where is that chemical laboratory or university?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There is none in the universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is the position of your education. There is no knowledge, and you are simply advertising, "Advancement of knowledge, university, PhD's, Nobel Prize holder." But they are all rascals. Fools' paradise. It is called, fools' paradise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If the scientists know that we are not this body, then definitely the whole outlook will be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we want to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They don't want to admit their failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolishness. If you are a fool and if you want to pose yourself as intelligent, that is another foolishness. You cannot make progress. Stubborn dogs. If you are seeking after knowledge, you must take the right knowledge. That is intelligence. And if you want to remain in ignorance and advertise yourself that "I am man of knowledge," how much cheater you are! You are cheating yourself and cheating others. That is going on. We want to stop this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just like many of our devotees, we experienced when we tried to preach to our parents, because they are much older, to admit that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the right path in life, means to also admit that they have wasted their entire life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real knowledge is to be given to the younger section. Older section, it is not possible. They will have to forget first of all, what they have learned. That they cannot. Therefore it is impossible. Therefore knowledge begins from the school children, not from the man who is going to die. (laughing) That is not... Impractical. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said <span class="Italic">kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān: [SB </span>7.6.1] "Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be taught from the very childhood." Not that at the time of death. That is not possible. Therefore our students, they are all young generation, they capture. These rascals, they cannot. Old fools, they cannot. There was a practical examination. One father and one daughter, both appeared for BA examination in India. The daughter passed and the father failed. It was in the newspaper. In old age they cannot take any lessons. They forget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> Because of sense gratification or mind...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, they say all... Yes. The bodily functions, intelligence...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Blunt, intelligence becomes blunt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, blunt. When the knife is sharp, it can cut, but if it is become blunt, then you cannot cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Or worn by age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have all been described as <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ: [Bg. </span>7.15] "Their real knowledge is taken away by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" Therefore we don't give any credit to all these rascals. Although we are very small, but we don't give any credit. We frankly say, "These are rascals, fools."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> After the 20th...During the Industrial Revolution in the western world....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Industrial Revolution means revolution of the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> That is Industrial Revolution. Increasing the number of <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> These scientists, they are also <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Because they have no real knowledge. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> means one who has got real knowledge. <span class="Italic">Brahma-jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.</span> And this industrial development means technologists; they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> But they have taken the position of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> in the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They are never as... They are always working. How they can take the position of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa? Brāhmaṇa's</span> position is to teach <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> knowledge, <span class="Italic">brahma-jñāna.</span> That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Prior to the growth of technology...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, there was technology. But not in such large scale. Village technology. There was a blacksmith. You want a knife. You take one piece of steel, and he will do it, phut phut phut phut, and he'll put in the fire, and everything do. And now you are manufacturing these cutleries, cutleries, in larger scale. So they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Similarly any factory, it is a combination of <span class="Italic">śūdras. Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:</span> "In this age, all are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span>" Only we are trying to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Otherwise all <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> So therefore there is no adjustment. Just like if you have got only legs, no arms, no mouth, so what is this body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Corpse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Corpse, yes. You require everything, full body. You require head, you require arms, you require belly, you require legs. But if you have got simply the belly and legs, then it is a dead body. It cannot work properly. The brain is lost; therefore they are mad after so much advancement of civilization. They are exactly like cats and dogs. As soon as you enter some country, dog, watchdog: "Wowf! Wowf! Why you have come? What is your position?" ("Where is your visa?"?) This is dog's business. This is dog's business. (laughter) And they have set up immigration department. But it is a dog's business, watchdog. I say it is watchdog's business. A first-class gentleman is being searched out pocket, whether you have got revolver. Cannot be trusted, all these educated rogues and thieves. So what is this advancement of civilization? It is civilization? No sober man, no intelligent man, all cats and dogs, thieves, rogues. Is that civilization? It is not civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The question I have, Prabhupāda is that before scientific advancement, many people would listen to, like, scriptural knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> That I have already said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But now they listen more to scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means <span class="Italic">śūdra. Śūdras</span> are interested to hear from <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> For example in the Bible they quote that the world is flat. So therefore when they found out the world is round, they say, "Oh, scripture is false."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Scientists, they have proven the truth that the world is round. Therefore scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That must be, therefore the scriptures must be transcendental. Nonsense scripture, and people become nonsense. So except Vedic literature, all nonsense scripture. They are not scripture. Manufactured. This Bible was manufactured by the saint, this saint, that, according to their imagination. It was not spoken by Lord Jesus Christ. What was spoken by Jesus Christ, that they ignore: "Thou shalt not kill." They kill. Nobody is following Christian principle; neither Bible is perfect. But that, if we say, we will be shot. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That is what they do now in the Vietnam. For God they are killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> One of the reasons that the Vietnamese war was beginning was because Communists, being atheists, it was a fight between the theists and the atheists. This was an excuse given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that is quite all right. We also prepare to kill atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But preach first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They don't preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, killing is also preaching. If I kill your ignorance, that is also killing. That is also killing. Not... Killing does not mean that everyone has to take the sword.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> A new method of warfare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is always there. By argument, by knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's a little wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you are not present with us, how is it possible to receive instructions, for example, on questions that may arise?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, the questions... Answers are there in my books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Other than that, for example, that we would ask you in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Do you direct us also through the heart? Besides the Paramātmā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If your heart is pure. Everything depends on purity. Whether there. What is this? Sacrificial arena? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> For children, I think. No? For cooking, yeah. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (About tennis players) How people are kept into ignorance. Life is so valuable, and they are wasting time in that way. Life is valuable, how life should be utilized, what is the object of life-they do not know anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Without knowing that the soul is eternal, everybody would be acting like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is... Bodily concept of life means animal life. The animal does not know. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">. Go-kharaḥ. Go</span> means cows, and <span class="Italic">kharaḥ</span> means ass. One who is in the, under bodily concept of life, he is no better than animals. So when the animal talks of knowledge, an intelligent man laughs. That is our position. The animals, they are talking of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> At least, the animals live by certain codes. They do not kill unless necessary. They only eat when necessary, whereas man, he kills unnecessarily, eats unnecessarily. So forgetting God, we are even lower than animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore we suffer also, more than the animals. (pause) So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a bogus religious sentimental movement. It is a scientific movement. So now it is up to you to prove this. Then you will be actually Kṛṣṇa conscious. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they were saying that everything in the universe is just happening by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are writing book by chance. Then what is the value of your book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The book is also by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone can write chance, so what is your credit? Anything nonsense can be written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Monod is his name. He got Nobel Prize in 1965 from... He is Frenchman, physiologist. And his, chance and necessity about life, he said everything started by chance. So he is saying that by chance these chemicals combined together, forming these molecules, the basic molecules...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But wherefrom the molecules came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> According to him it is simply by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chance. So everything is chance. So what is the necessity of your writing book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then necessity arises, so these molecules re-orient, change as a fashion because of necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If everything is by chance, where is the necessity? What is the meaning? Let the chance take place. Why necessity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He is hoping for another Nobel Prize by his chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All fools' paradise. That's all. Why do they send their children to school? Why not let them grow by chance? Is there any excuse if I say, "By chance I have violated this rule?" Is that the cause of excuse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's because of my ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is chance. That is chance. Because I am ignorant, therefore there is chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It would be just as stupid as saying a beautiful instrument like a car was made by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That is the most regrettable condition, that these rascals are getting recognition; talking all foolish, and they are getting recognition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's so strange. When I read that book. He defines the difference between the living and the non-living by a term called teleonomy. I tried to find out in the dictionary and I couldn't find any word like that. But I understood that what he meant was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hyerpolosvel. (Prabhupāda's mythical scientific word) (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> He invents his own word jugglery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He was trying to present the difference between organic beings and the non-organic beings. So he goes in such a round about fashion just to differentiate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Petitio principii. This logic is called petitio principii. He has to prove something, but he is taking his premises from that something. (end)</div>
