<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...what thought there is in bringing the temple and the farm closer together as one entity rather than two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherever we have got farm, we construct a temple also. Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The... Just like we have so many farming communities. Prabhupāda has mentioned that wherever our farm is... Actually we're not farmers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda is trying to create a class of intelligent men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas. Brāhmaṇa</span> is the head...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...of the human society. But actually it's one body, one entity already, simply that with different activities that we have to perform. The example is given, <span class="Italic">mukhe bāhūru pāda-ja:</span> That there is the head; there's the arms; there's the belly, the abdomen; and then there is the legs. And all of them are part of the same body. So you might say that the legs are removed from the head, or that the head is removed from the stomach, but actually it's all one body and it works together. But the head gives direction to the whole body, how to act properly, so that the benefit is there to be derived. So Śrīla Prabhupāda is creating a class of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> or heads of human society, who can give direction to the whole sphere of human activities so that they can become successful in human life. So in reality, we're not trying to create farmers, we're trying to create <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> But our farming communities are, so to speak, an example, an ideal example how human society can live: some people in the capacity of preachers, some people in the capacity of farmers, how so many activities can go on-various occupations-but all of them can be God-centered. So in reality, these people, they're farmers, they're out there on their tractor, they can jump off their tractor at any moment and preach the highest philosophy, because actually they're <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> They (are the) intelligent class of men. So it's one entity. The basic principle is that modern society is neglecting to train up-especially young men, you can see that in spite of so many universities throughout the world-these young men are being trained up how to become women-hunters and debauches. Going to the bars, going to the gambling houses, and they are supposed to be educated people. So real education is how to train up one to have ideal character, to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our men's productive. There must be food production, otherwise how the society will live. That is also a requirement. Good direction required, good government required, good production required, and good worker required. You can explain that there is no understanding of spiritual life. That they are missing the opportunity of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a spiritual culture, and basically speaking the human society begins from <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or accepting the principle of God. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> begins with this acceptance of the principle of God, that human beings, their activities, have to be regulated. Just like in human society there is marriage. This is according to scripture. Every scripture regulates there must be marriage. This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> It regulates certain activities that should be done, certain activities that should not be done. And basically speaking this is the beginning of human civilization; otherwise, they're simply living in a civilization of gross sense gratification which is in reality no different or no better than the society of animals. So from <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> human society begins and generally... You can see practically that <span class="Italic">dharma</span> generally focuses... People are taking that <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is for the basis of economic development. This is proven practically because in pioneer times in America for example, people they were simple going to churches and synagogues, and temples and all kinds of things, what have you. And economic development was going on very nicely, in fact, economic development could not have gone on unless there was this principle of religion. People were very, practically speaking... In a pioneer situation people are very barbaric, struggle for existence-you know, you're in the country, there is no road, there's no cities-everyone is very, simply interested to maintain themselves. But by churches and things of this nature, people saw the need for a civilized give-and-take way of living-economic development. Then gradually, the ideas developed further and further, but in modern days we can see that people are having economic developments and there's no need for God, they think at least. In other words, people are no longer attending churches, synagogues, things of this nature, because they are making sufficient money without the need of religion. Therefore, the basic principle is being missed that human life is not simply meant for economic development. Human life-we analyze, we can say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Human life is meant for making a solution of all material problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they do not know. That point is missing that there is another life which is eternal, blissful, life of knowledge. But they have no idea that we can eternally live without birth, death, old age, and disease. There is no information, neither education, but there is a life very... If you get eternal life, then the tribulations of material life no longer are there: birth, death, old age, and disease. But they have no idea or information because there is no intelligent man to understand that there is another life which is eternal, and life of bliss and knowledge. There is no information. That is the defect of the modern civilization, they are living like animals. No intelligence. So actually human life is meant for purifying our existential condition so that we may not be subjected to birth, death, old age, and disease. That they are missing. They do not know, neither there is any education, nor university. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to educate people on that line. It is not a sentimental religious system, it is an educational system. How one can transfer himself to eternal blissful life. Satsvarūpa is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him come in. When you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> A few hours ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, everything's all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Explain to them about eternal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eternal life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eternal life is described by Kṛṣṇa in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Verse"><span class="Italic">na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin<br class="calibre2"/></span>nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇo<br class="calibre2"/>na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.20]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Eternal means without a beginning and without an end. So this body, this human form of life, or tree form of life, or animal form of life, aquatic form of life, it has a beginning and it has an end. But the person, the soul, has no beginning or end. This is described by Kṛṣṇa that: <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe, kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> We've experienced in our practical lifetime that we were very tiny, youth, we had a small body, child's body: <span class="Italic">kaumāraṁ yauvanam.</span> Then youthful body, then we're having old man, old woman's body, like this. So practically speaking, this body is constantly changing. Although Kṛṣṇa gives this example because He is trying to explain a very fine point of understanding, namely transmigration of the soul: that in reality the body that we have is changing at every moment, at every instant. But we can not see that because our consciousness is not so sharp to pick up when there's change of body. But Kṛṣṇa explains, "You can see that you had a small body, now you have a youthful body, now you have an old man's body." Actually there is a continuum of change at every moment. So this is the changing material body, and the mind likewise is changing, but the soul, the living entity, is not changing. And this is experienced practically by the fact that in spite of so many changes of body that we had we've still the same person. Just like we can remember when we were young children playing in the park or at the streets, and then older, older, older; going to school; older, family life; older, now retired; now like this (indistinct). So like this the body is changing in so many ways but still I'm the same person. This can be practically experienced. Everyone has this understanding: different bodies but you're still the same person. So this spiritual identity should be the real concern, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This should be the real concern of the human society, not this temporary changing body. The whole human society is presently geared how to satisfy the demands of this temporary body. So we can see practically that this is fruitless. Ultimately we have to give up this body; ultimately we have to give up our connection with society, with family, with everything. So everything should have its proper place naturally, but the real focus of human life should be on the soul. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not only the soul, but the relationship of the soul with God. So practically speaking, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a spiritual movement. We're trying to come to the platform, as Prabhupāda has been speaking in class in the mornings about <span class="Italic">sat-dharma:</span> eternal religion or eternal activity of the soul. <span class="Italic">Sat</span> means eternal. Here in this material world everything is temporary. By accident you may be born in America or in India or in Japan or in a human form or in a cat form, but it's temporary. But the soul is eternal and there is also a place: <span class="Italic">paras tasmāt tu bhāvaḥ anyaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> Another place beyond this material world which is called the spiritual world. And that place is <span class="Italic">sanātana,</span> that place is eternal, and Kṛṣṇa also is eternal. So, <span class="Italic">sat, sat-dharma</span> or eternal occupation of the soul, eternal religion is that the living entity should be in this place, this eternal place where there's no change of body. That you have to take a body and then give it up, and then according to your work, take another body and then give it up, revolve in the cycle of birth and death unnecessarily. Go to the <span class="Italic">sanātana</span> atmosphere, and there the <span class="Italic">sanātana</span> Lord is there, and there the soul is in its natural environment, and the exchange of love that takes place in this spiritual world, this is <span class="Italic">Sat-dharma.</span> So this temporary world of birth and death, this is <span class="Italic">asat.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> It's <span class="Italic">asat:</span> it's a temporary place. We're taking it to be real just like in a dream we take that the dream is all in all. But by chanting this <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> we will awaken from this maddening materialistic way of life which is simply binding us up more and more to this false conception of attachment for this body. Practically we know that we have to give up this body, but still because everyone in the material world... Prabhupāda explained this morning, it's just like a mad-man. People are attached... just like if you are attached to your clothes and you're thinking that if my clothes are finished, I am finished. So this is a mad proposition. You can always get another set of clothes. Similarly we are different from this body. So to be overly attached to this body or even attached at all is a form of madness. That's a fact. We analyze this soberly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You mentioned an exchange of love in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Could you explain that more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone is exchanging love in this world, we see that practically, that husband and wife are exchanging love, children and parents are exchanging love, friend and friend are exchanging love. There are so many different relationships in which we exchange love. Even animals like a dog; a cat/dog is exchanging love. It's been analyzed, experiments have been done that even a plant is more productive when he knows that the person who is taking care of the plant is a friend. They speak about the green thumb. So even plants respond. They are sensitive. In a sense they are also exchanging love in a simple way. So this loving propensity is natural. The difficulty is that due to ignorance, we're exchanging love on the bodily platform, which is <span class="Italic">asat,</span> temporary. And therefore everyone is frustrated. Everyone is frustrated. It's a false platform of love. So the real platform of love is when we come to the soul platform. Kṛṣṇa speaks about this in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">That when you come to the soul platform, it's also called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta</span> stage or platform of the soul, then <span class="Italic">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām:</span> that <span class="Italic">bhakti, bhakti</span> means transcendental love and service to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means yes, exchange of love between God and the individual soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This becomes awaking of the spiritual platform. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness process is gradually to purify one, because that natural loving propensity is there. Our contention, and practically we are experiencing it, is that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is natural way of life. It's not artificial imposition. Rather in this present materialistic way of life, so many artificial standards and impositions have been put upon us. We can see that because culture is always changing. One year this is right to do, the next year that's right. Everything is simply mental concoction. But this Kṛṣṇa consciousness process is eternal, it's never changed. We have history from the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> For millions and millions of years people have been engaged in the very same process that we're following: of chanting the holy names, worshiping the Deity in the temple, taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> association with saintly persons. The very same process, it hasn't changed. And the very same sentiment of love of God is being awakened naturally. So our contention is that the love is simply misdirected. It simply has to be redirected towards Kṛṣṇa, and the spiritual master, he does this. He takes our energy, our love, our intelligence, our everything and directs it towards Kṛṣṇa. And as a result, you become purified. A very natural process. Just like we have a propensity to love so rather than waste our love on the temporary forms of the material world, because they're all perishable. <span class="Italic">Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv ātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api</span> [SB 2.1.4]<span class="Italic">. </span>First of all we love the body, <span class="Italic">deha.</span> And <span class="Italic">apatya,</span> we love the family members, the sons, <span class="Italic">kalatra,</span> we love our wife, <span class="Italic">ādiṣu</span> we like our community, nation, so many things. But all of these things, they're temporary. They won't last, they can't endure. So all of our love practically is being wasted. It's stolen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is an example. In a water tank you throw one stone. It becomes a circle. And the circle expands, expands, expands unless the circle comes to the shore. Similarly our loving affair begins from personal self to family, from family to society, community, nation, international. But still, it is imperfect unless the circle reaches to the lotus feet of God. Then it is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce [Cc. Madhya 22.42].</span> Here, any loving affairs, that is more or less lusty. A man or woman love each other with some desire, not without desire. That desire is sense gratification. But actually that is lust not love. Pure love can be exchanged in relationship with God. Here there are temporary... A boy, a girl or a man, a woman in relationship of love but it breaks as soon as the lusty desire is not fulfilled. So here there is no question of love. It is all lusty desire. Real love can be achieved when it is exchanged with Kṛṣṇa or God. <span class="Italic">Premā pum-artho mahān,</span> that is the recommendation given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That is the highest (indistinct) when we come on the loving platform with God, then we are satisfied. Big, big political leaders in our country like Mahatma Gandhi, he loved his country so much. But the result was that he was killed by his own men, by his country men. But this is not possible when the love is exchanged between God. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">, </span>a little love for God can save you from the greatest danger of life. That is real love. So if you love Kṛṣṇa, then you can love with everyone. Just like we are spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is out of love for Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise we would have sat down at home and love Kṛṣṇa. Why you are trying to spread this love exchange to others? Because I know or we know that here in this material world, the so-called love exchange is frustrating, and people are being frustrated. So let him love Kṛṣṇa, then we'll be successful. This is our mission. Everyone has got loving propensity. So this child has now love for his mother, for the mother has got... But as soon as the child will grow, the love is finished, he will love somebody else. When he becomes young man, his love is transferred to somebody else. So here the so-called love is not permanent, but when you love Kṛṣṇa it is permanent exchange of loving humor or mellow. So that is required. S<span class="Italic">ai</span> this called <span class="Italic">sai-eva. Sai(?)</span> means permanent it will never end. You'll relish loving mellows eternal.</div>
<div class="Verse">āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām<br class="calibre2"/>adarśanān marma-hatāṁ karotu vā<br class="calibre2"/>yathā tathā vā vidadhātu lampaṭo<br class="calibre2"/>mat-prāṇa-nāthas tu sa eva nāparaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Antya</i> 20.47]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Explain this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The eighth verse of Caitanya Mahāprabhu <span class="Italic">Śikṣāṣṭaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śikṣāṣṭaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I do not know anyone but Kṛṣṇa as my Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This is Lord Caitanya. He wrote only eight verses about all this literature. Then there is files and volumes and volumes about love of God. So in this <span class="Italic">Śikṣāṣṭakam,</span> eight verses, the last verse is translated as, He prays: "I do not know anyone but Kṛṣṇa as my Lord, and He will always remain as such, even if He handles me roughly in His embrace or makes me brokenhearted by not being present before me. He is completely free to do anything and everything, and He will remain my worshipable Lord unconditionally." So this is just the opposite, this is pure love, just the opposite of the, what Śrīla Prabhupāda is explaining that in this material world love is based on some desire that actually becomes a kind of business that "I love you if you will respond in this way." What to speak of someone saying that "I love you, even if you act as a debauch. You don't have to be faithful, that's... You can do as you like in your own way, but my declaration is that I simply want to serve You and You'll always be my worshipable object." So love should be like that, otherwise it is simply business that I will give you the product if you give me the money. But the lover is the living being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You shall not expect anything in return. That is real love. Just like this mother is loving child, expecting anything-no, not expecting any return. But she still she gives service. So that is as a little sample of pure love. But here also some... When the child is grown up, if the child is not obedient, the mother practically withdraws love. But in the spiritual world, unconditionally love is there. As it is explained, <span class="Italic">āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām. Marma-hatām:</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Antya</i> 20.47] whatever you do, I don't mind that but still I love you. That is pure love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> As a mother loves the child in pure love, does that help her to also find the pure love in the spiritual world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Just like mother Yaśodā is loving Kṛṣṇa. Nanda Mahārāja is loving Kṛṣṇa. That is pure love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, this loving affair with the mother and the son is a perverted reflection of that pure love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think he's asking a question also that sometimes comes up, that if one loves in this material love, for example one loves a child, or loves humanity, does this help to develop love of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But if you love God. It helps to love the human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I see, it's the other way!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if you supply food to the stomach, it helps the eye sight, but if you supply food to the eyes then you become blind. (everybody laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is <span class="Italic">Veda</span> important for, like we have our children here. As we come to this movement we're like children, it's important how we are molded, we are molded into the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as for example a child, it's important how the mother molds her activities, the child's activities; mold the child's life so that nice child grows up, act towards Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's asking a question, Śrīla Prabhupāda: isn't it important to mold the activities of ourselves and also the children in coming to this movement; to mold them that so that we can become Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is (why) our <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> is there. How these children are becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, (indistinct), how they are learning Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are doing the same thing, offering obeisances to the Deities, taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> In the same way as his father is doing. So automatically he's being trained up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Good association, that is required. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvidaḥ.</span> We are keeping this house for association of devotees so that automatically they become Kṛṣṇa conscious by association. The most unfortunate position is that there is no education about future life, or the perfection of life. The education is the animal education: the animal (is) eating, we are eating. If we are eating on table, or nice place, nice chair, then we think we are advanced. But the business is the eating. Similarly sleeping. The dog is sleeping on the street, we are sleeping in good apartment, skyscraper building. They are thinking this is advancement of civilization. But actually the business is sleeping. Similarly sex life. The dog is having sex life on the street, we are having in a very nice apartment. The business is sex. In this way our modern activities are animal activities but in a polished way. But that does not make any difference between the animal propensity and so-called civilized life. Civilized life is there when we understand what is God, our relationship with God. That is civilized life, but that is lacking. There is no such education. The education is only the same animal life in a polished way, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, could it be said that in a society where stress is placed on developing this understanding of God, people would naturally become disinclined for these so-called modern activities of sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the best qualification. If he becomes disinterested with these so-called modern civilized activities, that is the perfection of life. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra caiṣa [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">. Bhakti</span> means the more you become God conscious, you become disinterested with these material activities. And that is needed, because material activities means you are wasting our time. What is the value of animal life? It is risky. If we become like animal, then we'll become animal next birth. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> At the time of death, the mind's position will give me another body. That is nature's law. That you do not know. There is no education how the body is being transferred, how the soul is transferred to different bodies. And there are 8,400,000 different forms of body, and at the time of death, according to our mentality, we have to accept by nature's law a type of body which may not be human body. That we do not know. There is no education. The people are kept in darkness about the laws of nature. That is a very risky civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, some might say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a... Without any knowledge if we infect some disease, it will manifest in due course of time, and you have to suffer. Similarly without any knowledge we are infecting the modes of material nature and according to that modes of material nature, you have to accept a type of body which may not be very comfortable. Of course there is no comfort when there is death. We don't want death, but there is compulsory death. There is no comfort at all. But still the short duration of life, if we have little comfort... But again if we have this comfortable life, then what is the benefit of this comfort? That material laws of nature, we do not know, neither any education about (this). This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is giving that education. Therefore it is not a sentimental so-called religious movement, it is a scientific movement of real education. To solve the problems of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think human society has been educated to even understand the problem what to speak of a cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Problem there is, but he's a fool. Who wants to die? Why this fire brigade is running here and there? To save life. He doesn't want to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will say though that everyone has to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will say that is... Whatever they... Foolishly whatever they may say, then let them say. Actually he doesn't like to die. Otherwise let there be fire, why you called fire brigade? Let me die peacefully in the fire. (laughter) Nonsense he's suffering, but still he says there is no suffering. That is nonsense. That is ignorance. He's suffering every moment, but he does not know why he's suffering. That is ignorance. Just like an animal, you are taking into the slaughterhouse. He's suffering, he's screaming, but he does not know why you have taken to slaughterhouse (indistinct). And that is animal life. And when there will be question of why I am suffering? I did not want this fire, why there is fire? That is perfection (indistinct). Is there any solution? Then there is human life. And if he remains like animal, and simply try to make some remedial measures... He's suffering undoubtedly, but because he does not take it seriously, therefore he's animal. Animal does not take seriously why he's suffering. That is the distinction between human life and animal life. Suffering is there, but the animal does not take it seriously. But human life must take it seriously otherwise he's an animal. There are so many sufferings. This is <span class="Italic">adhibhau... adhidaivika. Adhidaivika:</span> by-you say accident-by nature, by superior power. Some miserable condition is enforced upon us. Suppose if there is an earthquake, that is not in your hand, but it may cause some havoc. This is <span class="Italic">adhidaivika.</span> Similar, <span class="Italic">adhibhautika:</span> Suffering caused by other living entities. And <span class="Italic">adhyātmika,</span> suffering caused by this body and mind. So suffering is always there, but we are suffering, we have been accustomed to suffer. But when the question is that why I am suffering, whether there is any remedy? That is human life. Otherwise, the animal life. That is the distinction between animal and human life. If there is fire, and there are animals only, dogs and cats, they cannot call fire brigade. They'll die, because they do not know how to take measures. But human being immediately calls fire brigade just to try to save himself. But the suffering is there, either he's animal or human being. But the distinction is the human being tries to counteract it, the animal cannot. If you simply become subject to this suffering without any remedial measure, then you are animal. And you are suffering and you try for the remedial measure, that is human life. This is plain thing. You cannot say there is no suffering. Suffering is there both for the animal and for the man. The man tries for the remedial measure, the animal cannot. Hm, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some of the modern-day cults in America, different philosophies, they say that all of the suffering is experienced within the mind. So they try by meditation to ignore the suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or... That's all right. When there is fire you meditate, why do you call fire brigade? If you are so great meditator, then you go on meditating, why you call for fire brigade? Nonsense, all rascals. (laughter) Simply rascals. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> They have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Rascals, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sometimes they say it's just a dream and they say if you are bothering me, and you are just my dream; I don't have to worry about it, I'll have another dream and you'll go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No but dream is... It may be, but when there is fire, you call it dream, but why do you call fire brigade? When you are diseased why you go to physician? Dream it. (laughter) The major problem is birth, death, and old age, and disease. You do not want that. You must seek the measures. That is human life. Whether birth, death, old age, disease can be stopped? If there is any such life that there is no more birth, death, that is human life. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>. </span>That is the Vedānta philosophy: "Now the human life is meant for enquiring about these things." If you don't enquire, then you remain animal. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to save the human society from this animal life. To bring him to the real human life. Animal life means there is suffering-go on suffering. Human life means there is suffering-how to get, how to counteract. That is human life. Suffering-so long you have got this body, there must be suffering.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> Ṛṣabhadeva is warning that <span class="Italic">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma: [SB </span>5.5.4] these rascals being mad after sense gratification, they are doing everything and anything irresponsibly. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ</span> means mad. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Things which you should not have done, but he's doing it. Why? <span class="Italic">Yad indriya-prītaya:</span> Simply for sense gratification. Therefore, he advises, <span class="Italic">na sādhu ayam:</span> this is not good. So why it is not good? <span class="Italic">Yata:</span> he has already got a body, material body for which he's suffering, and he's again creating the circumstance by which he'll again get a material body and will suffer. Therefore, one should act very responsibly. Not like madmen. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then Ṛṣabhadeva instructs, <span class="Italic">nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">. </span>This body, although I have got this body, and the dog has got the body, or the hog has got the body, but these bodies are not meant for being spoiled like the dogs and hogs. The hog is also whole day working to find out where is stool. So if you also work whole day and night for our sense gratification, then where is the difference between the hog's life and my life. The human life, human brain should be sober to understand what is the problem of life, why I'm subjected to so many tribulations, how to remedy, how to find out the remedy and that requires <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> In order to create that brain, it requires a little <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Therefore we are recommending no illicit sex, no meat eating, no intoxication, no gambling. Because we are already mad by material existence, and again we are... If you are forced to become more and more mad by intoxication, by meat eating, by this... Then where is your life? Your life is finished. Because to understand these problems of life requires a little brain. So to create that brain, this little <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> is required. He's already puzzled, and if you make him more and more puzzled by supplying him intoxication and this gross eating of meat, then he remains in the grossest platform of ignorance. That is not human activity. The brain must be little clear to understand what is the value of life, why I am suffering, if is there any remedial measure, how can I take it. That is brain. And if the brain is used only to find out where is sense gratification, where is sex, where is food, where is shelter, where is money? Then, that is, that business is being done by the hogs and dogs. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to save people from this dogs' and hogs' life and to come to the real platform of understanding the value of life. They do not know it. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know what is the aim of life. Simply by false hopes they are trying to adjust things with material effects. That will never do that. <span class="Italic">Durāśayā. Durāśayā</span> means it is useless hope. It cannot be. Just like we practically see that the, here in New York City, American people are very rich and intelligent, but they cannot stop this fire which is unwanted. They cannot stop it. That is not possible. Because they are living very high, 300 feet high or more than that, you are not safe still. You are still in the same danger. Because you are living in big, big skyscraper building, it does not mean that you will not die. Death is there also, birth, death, old age, disease, the real problems of life. It does not mean that because we have advanced in so-called material civilization, you have avoided birth, death. Even big, big scientists who gave us so many big, big inventions, but still they died. They could not invent something which will protect them from death, that at the time of death, give me this pill so that I will not die and I'll go on giving you more scientific advance. That is not possible. What is your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some people think that by meditating they can somehow, another ignore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meditating means this subject matter: that I don't want death, why death is forced upon me? That is real meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then the problems of life are more than simply those which we perceive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise, what is the meditation? Think about something seriously, that is meditation. But if you have no important serious thinking, simply some imagination, how it will help you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Excuse me, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This evening they are having one convention here, the Democratic National Convention. One of the two big political parties in the city, at one place called Madison Square Garden. And all the television and newspaper people in the whole country will be there. They're beginning at 8 o'clock this evening. So we want to send all the devotees in the temple on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party there, because we feel that not only will the atmosphere become purified but also all the television cameras and all the newspaper people will interview our devotees and take their pictures, and they will be on television all over the country, simply because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good cause.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Yes, most of them gave orders to our... Even unlike...

And we lowered the price to about 45 rupees which was, which was right where they can afford to pay for the volumes (indistinct) take them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the usual price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> $7.95 which would be like too many, eighty rupees or something like that. It would be very expensive for India for one volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have reduced the price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> To forty-five rupees. Gopāla Kṛṣṇa made it very, very reasonable for them that they can partake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. They are taking the book. That is wanted. We don't want much profit.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got that store?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Well, we're doing well wholesaling now, Prabhupāda. We sell to stores, department stores across the United States. We had to give up the store because we couldn't have, you know, timewise.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> More volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wholesale business is better than retail business. My father was a wholesale, cloth seller, cloth merchant. So, he liked wholesale business, not retail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> The wholesale is much better. It's more financial...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A little profit, but aggregate is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> The volume is more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, volume is more. In those days, he was making cloth business, he was making profit one anna or two paise per piece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Very small profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The Marwari business man, they want to sell, for suppose, one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of worth goods, if there is customer to pay him immediately one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> ten rupees, he'll sell, immediately sell. He thinks "I've got that ten rupees," that's all. Again person. That is their way of doing it. They are not calculating that I have invested one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees, I must get at least ten percent profit. No. Not at loss. A little profit. "Never mind, give me cash." That is Marwari business. And he, when he goes to purchase from his supplier, he sees that this man is purchasing at the time one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> two <span class="Italic">lakh.</span> So he gives him all credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Works on the credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So later on, he establishes his credit (and) without any payment, he gets supplies. And they keep their credit. On the day of payment, they must pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Yes, exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the Marwaris, they become very big businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Very powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This Birlas, they have become so big, they have so much credit in the market that by telephone they will ask any gold merchant, that you purchase one thousand <span class="Italic">tolās</span> of gold for me. He'll immediately purchase, because he has a credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Sure, many years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And next moment he phones another gold merchant, "What is the price," he says. Say one anna less... I'll sell one hundred <span class="Italic">tolās.</span> So he'll purchase without any investment and sells immediately and makes one hundred <span class="Italic">tolās,</span> one anna profit, some (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By telephone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Very quick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way, they become very, very big. They know how to use this art, these Marwaris. If you are going in India, you'll see Marwaris are very quickly, they will come. They know how to do business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Kallman:</span> Volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Volume. Volume of the... Of course, volume of business can be done which is easily seller.</div>
