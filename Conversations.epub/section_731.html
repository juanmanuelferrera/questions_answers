<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I must first of all imbibe the spirit of staying here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I must first of all imbibe the spirit. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have already. Otherwise how you are coming daily?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't know. I have got some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't pay you any fee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I feel some sort of attachment to you. That is why I come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't pay you any fees, but why you come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That I don't know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you charge when you go outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I charge, by night, hundred rupees, and day, sixty, fifty, sixty rupees, not much. I don't charge much here. Bombay people charge double than me. You mean you want to charge me? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Hare Kṛṣṇa. No, I mean to say, you are a professional man, you charge, but why do you come here free unless you have in mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't understand why I am attracted to you specially. I don't understand. I very much thinking, I have been thinking about it. There must be some <span class="Italic">pūrva-janma.</span> We may be relatives. I don't know. No <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> has been able to attract me as much as you have. Not even temples have attracted me, to tell the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> There is no <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> except Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Dr. Karttika Chandra Bose, he was a very big man. I was, under him, manager of Bose's laboratory. So from the very beginning my father was paying him two rupees fees. But when he became very big, still my father was paying two rupees. He was friend. So he refused to take. "No, no, no, you must be paid something." So he used to accept that two rupees. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Two rupees in those days were lot of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Two rupees, nowadays forty rupees at least. Twenty times. Just like <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> You can... <span class="Italic">Ghee</span> or gold. Gold standard. So in our childhood, I have seen our mother used to purchase gold for ornaments-twenty rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Eighteen, twenty rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Now it is six hundred. Six?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Seven hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Thirty-five times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When I was married, gold was at nineteen rupees and fifty paisa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In 1930.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nineteen rupees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nineteen rupees and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Per <span class="Italic">tola</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Per <span class="Italic">tola.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In 1930. 1930, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Sovereign cost eighteen rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sovereign was fourteen rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our marriage in 1918...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was more because the First World War. Then it slumped down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It dropped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the lowest was in 1930. Then it rose. Then in 1935 it was thirty rupees and in 1940 it was thirty-eight, and 1950 it was fifty rupees. And 1956 we bought at the rate of fifty-six rupees. I still remember that because we have been buying gold every year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> 1959 or '60 the price was ninety-six <span class="Italic">rupees</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then suddenly it rose. Now, because Americans are buying gold, the gold standard has been left out. They have taken, cornered the gold of the whole world. But I have heard that the Russians have got some gold mountains on the surface. They can take out gold very easily from there. Here you have to dig up deep down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in South Africa there is gold. In the city there are so many gold mines in South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. South Africa is today supplying more than half of the world gold. Our mines are getting exhausted in Kolar(?) and all this, Mysore State. America, they have not been able to search out gold anywhere. Perhaps in South America they may be having some gold mines, but they have not made any survey. But the Russians, they say there are very huge mountains, gold on the surface.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Sumeru is made of gold, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Where is that located? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In your mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Where is the sun located now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> 93,000,000...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Sun. Sun. Where is located now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Oh, it's out of my sight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Sumeru we cannot see. It's not on the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can, but you have no eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) I call him also <span class="Italic">mahārāja.</span> He's a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bandhu.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nanda-kumāra:</span> In South America one man went up the Amazon River and he found a place where he could pick gold nuggets up out of the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gold nuggets are there in the rivers, so many, in Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gold nuggets. Because gold never get, I mean, oxidized. It is always in (unclear). So nuggets, they are available in big rivers even in Africa. Because when they come through the mountain, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is one river in India also, Suvarna-rekha, between Orissa and Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The sand is of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There you can find gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The city of Johannesburg is built on a gold reef, a reef of gold. There's so much gold there, and to dig it up they will have to break the city streets. They have deliberately built the city on top of the gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That South Africa is in the belt of Brazil more or less. And Brazil is very difficult place to search about this because they are all jungle, no? Brazil and south of Brazil. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Russians do not utilize the gold...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They think gold has got no value so far as value... Because it is a stamping metal. Otherwise what use it can be made of? So far as the society is concerned, iron is more important than gold, to tell the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them exchange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> From the utility point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them exchange. We give them iron. (laughter) Let me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They don't want to. They may use it at some future date.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Karl Marx, Hegel, Engels, all these fellows were more materialist, all those three philosophers. And the philosophy of Karl Marx is the abstract materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Now one book has been published in Russia, <span class="Italic">An Appreciation of Nehru.</span> All the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was a Marxist, you see. He went in 1912 to Moscow before the revolution to meet all those fellows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This book is stories of different Russian scientists and politicians, philosophers, giving their appreciation of how they knew Nehru and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to pacify Indira Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Flattering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So they've just presented this book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharai saṁstuta puruṣa paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How they smuggled away the secret of atom smashing from America, these Russians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They smuggled away the secret of atom bomb from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Germans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, the Russians smuggled away. Germans came to America, taking that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They understood from the Germans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, sir, but it is said that the German scientist ran away to America because they were afraid of Hitler. If Hitler gets the secret of atom, he would bomb out the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Hitler knew it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. They were not able to be successful to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He knew it, everything, but he did not like to do it. He said. He said. He was gentleman. But these people are not gentlemen. He knew it perfectly well. He said that "I can smash the whole world, but I do not use that weapon." The Germans already discovered. But out of humanity they did not use it. And all the, your American, other countries, they have stolen from German ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think, sir, German scientists ran away during the wartime to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Some of them went to Russia, some of them-(aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa-to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The German scientists, they went to America. But the plans for these things were left in Germany and the Russians came. The Russians got the plans, the Americans got the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I see. So the Russians, I mean, scientists produced from the plan the bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That's why the Americans got it first, because they had the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that man was caught from America giving away secret to the Russians. He was electrocuted, no? The science does not belong to a single race or a nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, more scientists were there in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say Germany could produce more scientists because they had all our, our <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and all our secret ancient books with them, the Sanskrit. They had read them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And one Śaṅkarācārya-I don't know which-who was the professor in one of the colleges of Madras, he went and met Professor Einstein and talked about... And then he gave out some, one <span class="Italic">śloka</span> of two lines which actually depicted how atoms could be smashed. That is in our sciences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> This is fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, it's a fact. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...ago, there was one Mr. Badhuri in Benares. He was a great astrologer. So he told me that from Benares the Germans have taken three books: one is <span class="Italic">Akāśa-patola,</span> one is <span class="Italic">Kapota-vahi</span> and his <span class="Italic">Khapoda-vahi. Khapoda-vahi,</span> this airplane. <span class="Italic">Kha</span> means <span class="Italic">akasa.</span> And there is another science, <span class="Italic">kapota-vahi,</span> to carry man by the pigeons. That is not yet displayed. <span class="Italic">Kapota-vahi.</span> And there is another, <span class="Italic">Akasa-patola.</span> Any, any, even your chairs you sit down; by <span class="Italic">mantra</span> it will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> that, I mean, Bhima threw away those elephants and rowing in the sky. And when Parīkṣit thought "How could it be?" then that elephants came down in the story. That means they were rowing about just like sputniks of today, perhaps. I don't know how they might have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, three books they have taken. They paid some eight <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees. That Mr. Badhuri told me. (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That means this civilization must have felt the pangs of the modern sciences and then they must have lost it. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not lost. It is there. You don't take it. That's it. What is there? One who can read... Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> They couldn't chant those <span class="Italic">mantras</span> though, could they? If they tried... Even if they tried, they wouldn't be able to chant the <span class="Italic">mantras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Nobody taught them. You are chanting. How you are chanting? Nobody taught them. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapataka:</span> Why the Germans are good Sanskrit scholars? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they had very good tendency for learning Sanskrit to know so many things. That was their research. They knew it that in Sanskrit language there are so many wonderful things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, sir, they say that in American universities also, many universities have started teaching Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In every school, every college, every university, there is Sanskrit. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...was the real man who, when he started studying <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> he realized that in Sanskrit language there is a huge literature of great importance. He spread the things in Germany. No, he was staying in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By international scholars' meeting these diacritic marks were discovered for studying Sanskrit. The diacritic marks which we use, that is international agreement of Sanskrit scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. Yes. Those marks. A, and a and u and ai and these dots. Yes, that is international. Nobody can claim. That is long back, sir. I think Max Muller's time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There were so many scholars, even in Paris, Germany, and Italy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Professor Roe and Webb, they were professor in Presidency College when we were school children. They admitted Sanskrit is the mother of all languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In fact, Persian is the first letter of Sanskrit which looks like that. When you study Persian, so many words-Sanskrit directly taken Persian. In the Russian language, I mean, so many words are there of Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whole world you'll find Sanskrit. The first word, mother and father, that is Sanskrit, <span class="Italic">matri</span> and <span class="Italic">pitri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Ha, everywhere. Everywhere starts like that, all the languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñā,</span> to know, from that, knowledge, <span class="Italic">jñā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...mother is <span class="Italic">"mere"</span> and father is <span class="Italic">"pere."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...is <span class="Italic">madri? Ba, pha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In Spanish, father is <span class="Italic">"padre."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Latin and Sanskrit are more or less common. They have got those <span class="Italic">sapta-vibhaktīs</span> in Latin also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this "Christ" has come from <span class="Italic">Kristo, Kṛṣṇa.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The cow from... <span class="Italic">Gao</span> from cow, and cow from <span class="Italic">gao.</span> No? It is absolutely not..., so very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are Kṛṣṇian, and they are Christian. There is similarity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nomenclature. Christ was really a <span class="Italic">bhāgavata,</span> I mean, in a true sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who accepts God, he is <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Christ, sir, really taught absolutely <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span> The way... All his sayings, the <span class="Italic">New Testament</span> and his Sermon on Mount, all is absolutely <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> I have studied it very, in great detail and compared the two myself. So Christ was the greatest Hindu, to tell the truth. But as those people in the Middle East were heathens and absolutely <span class="Italic">junglis,</span> they crucified him. Had he been here he would have been a big saint and <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recent history is that he did not die. He came to Kashmir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Came to Kashmir. There is a tomb in Kashmir. I read some literature about it. His resurrection... They say that they smuggled him out of that cave. It is possible. When he was on the cross, he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even by yoga system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He must have gone in a trance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He lived by trance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was a great devotee. There is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By trance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When he... On the cross they say he uttered, "Father, don't forsake me." That is the time he went into trance most probably. Eh? He must have gone in trance when he uttered the last words, "Father, don't forsake me." And then when he was brought down in the lap of his mother and they took him in the cave, no? Under the guard of those Italian soldiers. Then there was a big hurricane or something like that and they all ran away. And after that he was smuggled away from that place. Christ has rebuilt his father's temple in true sense, the way he spread the Christianity. The churches have degenerated in his teaching, unfortunately. It is the church. That happens with every, in every, I mean, these things, teachings. Race, this race is very bold, indeed, that God choicest race, these Jews, somehow or other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jews?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Really, it is God's choicest race. (laughter) They have produced wonderful people right from Christ up to Professor Einstein, very bold people, very bold indeed. They are truthful to their convictions. They would die for their convictions but they will not, I mean, budge an inch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But they're impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Very brave. Very brave race.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Today still, those people really very brave. Very brave. It is the choicest race from God. It's a fact.</div>
