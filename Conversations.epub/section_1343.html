<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The construction is going on. And this man Mr. Lord, from England, he's getting more active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> England?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's about fifty-year-old gentleman who was the manager of a big club in London. So he had been associating with the devotees in London, and they suggested he come to India and help manage our restaurant and guesthouse. So he was the aide-de-camp of the Viceroy of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Remember, I told you about him, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So he knows a little Hindi. He has a very distinguished...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which viceroy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which viceroy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The last viceroy, Mountbatten. And he's very diplomatic in dealing with people. And when he meets with the Indians, they immediately respect him, just like in the old days. So I think he'll be a very good personality to have in the restaurant and guesthouse. People will be happy to meet him. He's tall, he has a nice British accent, and he's following our regulative principles. He's a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I met him at Bhaktivedanta Manor, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we were there. He came a couple of times, very nice gentleman. He's working without any salary. Simply he asked for a room, and he wants to devote his life. Real gentleman. He's more British than any Britisher I've ever met.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, he's about, I think, sixty years old now. And when he was a young man of twenty he was the aide-de-camp of the viceroy. And I think he was also the secretary to the governor of Punjab when it was under the British.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He met with Gandhi and all of these other leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Then, just after I left... Before that, I spoke to Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, and he was arranging for Mahāṁśa Swami and Mr. Polareddy to meet the President of India to invite him to be the chief guest because Mr. Polareddy of Hyderabad knows the present President. And then, so far as the publicity for the opening, we felt that we should actually fix up the chief guest first, because if some big person like the President comes, that will be an important part of the wording of the invitation and the other publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So finishing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Construction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, the building was not finished. I think that... I mean the inside of the temple and the theater and the restaurant and lobby of the guesthouse and many of the guestrooms will be ready, but the marble work on the domes was very behind schedule. So when I was there only about ten or fifteen percent of the marble on the three big domes was up, and the... Of course, the three domes at the entrance were almost ready. So the three main domes could be finished by the time of the opening, but there will be marble work that has to go on after the opening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will never be finished. When the date is being fixed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, we fixed it for January lst and begin the ceremonies on December 29th, which is Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī's Disappearance Day. And... The ceremonies begin a few days before the actual installation of the Deities. So those ceremonies, or <span class="Italic">yajñas,</span> those will begin on Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta's Disappearance Day, which is December 29th, in about six or seven weeks. And then, a few days later, on January lst, which is the English New Year's Day and Sunday, that will be the actual installation ceremony, and thousands of people will be coming. And we also discussed that there should be very opulent <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution, and different arrangements for receiving the people and <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">darśana</span> and festival activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still work is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. Actually on the date that we were planning to open on Dussehra, nothing was actually ready-even the things that were, we were sure would be ready. But I feel even if some things are not ready this time, most of the things will be. But there has to be some final date, otherwise it will never end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, before Yaśodānandana Swami left, he had written the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> that the new date was going to be January lst, and I spoke to Yaśodānandana Swami's assistant, Smara-hari, and he was not sure whether the b<span class="Italic">rāhmaṇas</span> had confirmed this. So he was going to write them today and ask them to confirm that January lst was all right. But he received a letter from Yaśodānandana Swami saying that Yaśodānandana Swami would be coming December 26th. So he's definitely planning to be there in time. And at the time that we postponed the last opening, the br<span class="Italic">āhmaṇas</span> said that whenever we want to have the opening, they are always ready to come. So it seems that they should be able to come on December 28th or 29th to begin the ceremonies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> must be fixed first of all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. So he said he would write today, and this evening I'll confirm it that he wrote and sent that letter, and then, within a week, we should actually get the confirmation. Otherwise they are very eager to do this and the only thing would be the date. So this afternoon we're planning to execute the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust and also the amendment to your will. So Viśvambhara Prabhu and I are supposed to go to Mathurā now to meet the registrar and some other people. So is it all right if I go now? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The medicine can be given for ten or twelve days and everything will go exactly according to some plan. This was my point from the beginning. It's not a very difficult thing. The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> probably can adjust very easily to stop stool from passing. Naturally, if you stop the medicine, maybe the stool will stop, but that doesn't actually solve the problem. That doesn't cure the disease. The disease is not that you're passing stool. That's a side effect of, perhaps, the medicine or maybe something you're eating. The medicine is required for getting better, but now, if the medicine causes you to pass stool, if that's actually the reason, then it has to be adjusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Just a couple of days ago, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were constipated, and you were thinking that it was necessary to take an enema.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But stool-passing this many times is not right either. Passing stool five, six times, that is not right. It's obvious that it's a result of something. It's either the medicine or the diet. Prabhupāda says it's the medicine, just like last time when he took that <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja,</span> and he was right. It was the medicine. [break] ...the best thing to do. There may be some good effect by taking the medicine in addition to the causing you to pass stool. So if by giving you some other small medicine at the same time, you can still take this medicine and you don't pass stool, then that's the best thing. This only a <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> knows. I don't know this. I have no idea. Maybe we should take the help of that... This doesn't seem like a very difficult thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Passing stool is something that any <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> should be able to treat, and maybe for this small thing we should call that assistant who was here yesterday. That's why that <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> from Calcutta arranged for there to be an assistant here, in case... In other words he came and diagnosed the disease, and he made a very complicated thing, medicine that an expert had to make. And for the fact that there might be some side effect, that you may not sleep properly or you might be passing stool, something of this kind, he found out one assistant for the purpose of helping in these cases. So why not carry through with that and take the help of this assistant, see what he says? This is a common ailment that people have, diarrhea or passing stool too often, loose bowels. That's not a very major problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's not necessarily the only solution, to stop. I just explained, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that that is not the only way. Another way may be that they add some other kind of medicine which stops the passing of stool. The medicine you're getting is supposed to be doing good to your kidney and liver. That it causes you to pass stool, that is not good, but at the same time, it may be doing good for the kidney and liver. If you stop taking it, then how will you heal the kidney and liver? Simply by not passing stool, that's not going to heal the kidney and liver. What we want is that you should not pass stool too much and at the same time you can still have your kidney and liver healed. Naturally, if you stop taking medicine, the stool may stop passing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is not experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I don't know ...He's not as... The point is, for such a thing that you have now, passing stool, I don't think that requires a highly learned <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>. That's a common ailment, that someone passes stool too easily. That's not a very difficult ailment to take care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So consult him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. I think this is the time to do that. This is a side effect of taking the medicine. Just giving up taking medicine may solve one problem, but it's not going to solve the main problem. This is to say that we're putting some hope on this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> from Calcutta. If eventually he is shown that his medicine didn't work, then I won't..., I wouldn't say anything. But I'm going on the argument that his medicine is doing some good. So I don't want to see it stopped. So you have no objection if we consult the other <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> do you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. I think this is the purpose for which he was chosen, at such a time like this that he should be consulted. I'll tell Bhakti-caru to consult him. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Finished with urine, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhakti-caru, Prabhupāda is talking to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda wants him to come every day, once a day, and check him out. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hundred cc's, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your urine was 100 cc's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, urine is all right. Urine, it is all right. I am lying here. He can come conveniently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhakti-caru, Prabhupāda says he's lying here, so the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> can come whenever it's convenient, 'cause he's always here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Right. That's what I told him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you should pay for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Appreciate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Appreciate. There's no problem for that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda is asking him how did he get to know Shastriji. So he said that it's I who took him there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How will we stop the stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Bhakti-caru, what is he saying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying that for controlling the stool he's going to just give juice of ginger roots and honey mixed together, and just that. He's not going to give any other medicine for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Gentle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That will stop the stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying yes. He doesn't want to change this medicine. He says that none of these medicines has any ingredient that might cause stool or might make him pass stool. (Hindi) He's saying that passing stool is due to the old stool that was in the stomach. That is coming out. They are not laxatives, as such. Now I remember, he was telling also, that Shastriji, that Śrīla Prabhupāda's intestine has become shrunk, dried up. Now they are slowly, slowly, they have got to become loose and looser, and this might be one thing like the intestine is loosening, and that is causing the bowels to move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if that is true, then why stop the stools?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, I mean since it's causing inconvenience... He's saying that these two agents are natural digesters, both ginger juice and honey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Natural digestives? So what does that have to do with stopping the stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Anyway, since he said, we can just try it. (Hindi) He's not actually causing it to stop. He said that it will... Now, last few times, Śrīla Prabhupāda has passed very light stool and liquidish. So ginger root and honey will make it sort of thicker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's asking whether, while passing stool, there's a feeling that stomach has been cleared, kind of a constipated feeling, in spite of... Śrīla Prabhupāda said that it was happening like that before, but last few times it was liquidish. It was watery stool, so there is no question of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi with <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> assistant and Prabhupāda)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhakti-caru, what's going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He was wondering about one medicine that has some roots and herbs mixed together and boil it for a long time and just give the extract of that. He was wondering whether that medicine, how I have that medicine... There are different items in it. That <span class="Italic">vaidyajī</span> already made, mixed it together. So he was wondering about that medicine, how it is, how do I keep it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi) So he told me yesterday also that there should be continuous prayers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that "I want to see you, your, this very much." (?) Still, we can pay him. I'll do. And this... Send him car. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We'll do that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja assistant:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you do... Account for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I know. We'll do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (inaudible-conversation about paying the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>'s assistant's fare to and from his home) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...notarized copies of everything. This registrar is not the real registrar. He's only a clerk. The registrar is on leave. So because this man is not so experienced, it takes a little extra time to do everything with him. So Girirāja and I have had a little bit of experience, so we had to teach him some things. Now everybody understands clearly. Everything is now completed. Your signatures were quite good, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your signatures were not bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This thing? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your signatures were fairly good. Some of them were very good. They remarked that the signature was strong... [break] I tried to make it as quick as possible. Now I have the receipts, and I will keep them locked in the almirah just like we did last time. And after about one week we'll be able to get the original documents after they've been registered. In the meantime, on Monday we're going to open up a bank account in the name of Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust in Punjab National Bank, New Delhi. Girirāja, who is the secretary of the Trust, and Bhavānanda Mahārāja, who are the treasurers, will open the account. So the interest from the fixed deposits will go directly into that account. Is that nice? That was your idea. And the bank will be happy that we're keeping the money in their bank. All of your plans are perfect, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And our perfection is simply to carry them out without changing in any way. You have such complete plans that we don't have to do anything new. We have to work our whole lifetime simply to carry out what you've planned. Even then we won't be able to complete everything. We'll have to trust to those who come after us to finish everything. So I'll just finish everything now with them, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and lock everything away, and then I'll come back. I don't want to leave Girirāja alone. It's nice to do everything together, two. I'll come right back afterwards. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Trust deed somebody may read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. I can bring it just now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. [break] San Diego, we have got a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Oh, yes. We have... They just moved to a nicer location, nicer building. They have maybe seventy devotees. It's quite large temple near the ocean in San Diego. They have... Every year at Govardhana-pūjā they have a very nice festival in the park. They have chanting and discourse and distribute <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Then in the spring again they have a very nice festival. You were there one time. You spoke. Your Divine Grace spoke at one festival in the park in San Diego. They also go to preach just over the border in Mexico, and many Mexican boys join our San Diego temple, Mexican boys who've come to America. They join our temple in San Diego. The Deity there is very beautiful and very nicely dressed also in San Diego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Their new temple is very nicely decorated, with arches and everything. Rādhā-Giridhārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The president is Guṇa-grāhī Prabhu. He's been a devotee for a long time. The management is also very nicely going on. [break] You sent Bhavānanda there many years ago when they were in Brooklyn and ordered him to make the devotees happy. And ever since then, they've been peaceful... (indistinct) Even before that. I remember when I first came to New York, when the storefront was there. I came on Sunday, and there were so many different preparations. Haṁsadūta Mahārāja was cooking. And so many different preparations. And after taking that feast I decided that I would not leave-"This is too nice." So they're going on, still very opulent, sumptuous <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>. And people are deciding that "Oh, this is very nice. Let us not leave. Let us go on taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>." And in the restaurant very respectable people come. (pause)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, what we have to do is carry on with this medicine, medical treatment, and let the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> come. Then, when he comes from Calcutta, he'll review everything that's happened and he'll see what your condition is like. And if he feels that the liver and kidney have been cleared up a little bit, then he'll begin to give medicine for giving you strength. And we will make him stay here until you get sufficient strength. And if you do get sufficient strength, which means his medicine is working, then he can take you to Māyāpura. And after some days, if he gives you medicine for strength and you don't get any strength, then there's no reason to leave Vṛndāvana. He may go back, but we will stay here. I think that should be our course of action. We certainly... I've looked just now with Upendra, and pretty much, you've increased by about double what you drink and you've increased by about double the amount of urine. But that's not going to give you strength very much. And the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has also said that he's not giving any medicine for giving strength at this time. Mostly he's giving medicine which should help the kidney and liver. I can't see inside your body to know if your kidney and liver are better. That he has to say. And if he says that it is getting better, then he can give the medicine for giving strength. And that's something that we can notice. Once he gives the medicine for strength, we'll be able to see if you're actually getting strength. After five or six days, if you're not getting any strength, then we'll know that the medicine is not effective. If it is effective, then we can go with him. You'll have more strength and we can go to Māyāpura. He can take us there and we'll carry on. And if for some reason it's not effective, then we have to trust simply in <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-nāma.</span> That we're doing anyway, but that's... We'll have to do exclusively at that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Get on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Does that sound right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. There's no alternative. There's no question of going to any more <span class="Italic">kavirājas</span>. This is the last one. He's the best we've found, and if his medicine doesn't work, then let us simply depend on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> That was fifty and clear, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Fifty and clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhavānanda, you are not feeling well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No, now I'm feeling better, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're all praying to take some disease from you. We're all praying to take over your disease onto us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not desirable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not desirable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) If you all become diseased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but you single-handedly can spread this movement better than all of us together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the problem. You are all become stationed to me.(?) Who will work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> At least this disease of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very infectious. Everyone catches it from you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They can't find any medicine to stop it. It just keeps going on more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They call it epidemic. [break] ...dream last night that you were eating all kinds of nice fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that sound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's one of the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> shaking out the dust in the rugs. In my office we have some rugs, so he takes them outside and shakes them. He's a nice <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> young boy from the Gurukula, from Mexico. Is it time to go on, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break] ...today. So I would meet him last night, and if he was to come this evening I wouldn't think that there would be any harm, that he could come this evening, I think it's not bad in that it sort of sometimes has an effect to encourage the patient if the doctor or <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> comes. It's reassuring. So I think it's nice that he comes. There should be someone with a little bit of knowledge who we can consult each day. He may not be as expert as the Calcutta <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> Still, he is more expert than we are. And he was appointed by the Calcutta <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> to come and check up on you and see how you are doing, see if there were any side effects. The real question is that your kidney and liver should be getting better. There's no doubt that you're getting weaker now. That I can see. I've never seen you this weak. But according to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very weak. I sit up..., oh, everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Finished. No, I could see that when you were sitting up, everything was becoming dislocated, everything. You can't sit up very much, neither you should sit up, Śrīla Prabhupāda, very much. But I would recommend you to sit up when you have to drink only. This bathing we could do at other times. This drinking, unless you sit up, you won't drink. I've seen that. You don't drink hardly anything. Unless you're willing to let us... See the trouble is that when you lay down and drink, you're used to drinking just a little bit. So if you'll allow us to give you the same amount that you drink when you sit up, then there's no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, just like when you sit up... It's natural, when someone sits up, it's easier to drink. Laying down, it's more difficult. But still, you require the nourishment. You shouldn't decrease your drinking because you can't sit up. It just means you have to be willing to drink the same amount, but drink it while you're laying down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Which will take some longer time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's a little more difficult, but it's not that you can't drink. It's just that it takes longer. So if that's all right with you, then we won't even request you to sit up when it's time to give you something to drink. Would that be all right? Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Can I give you some barley milk, Śrīla Prabhupāda, now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now acceptable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. How many cc's is that, Bhakti-caru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> It's about forty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Forty. So give Prabhupāda two more of those. Actually, usually you drink about 200 cc's of barley milk, and you've just drank about 50.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> You can wait a few minutes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and then, when you're feeling able to, you can take a little more. There's no rushing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's not going to... Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the trouble to take more now? It's a botheration? But that's... At least you should take the same amount you were taking when you were sitting up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's difficult. This means you will stop practically getting any nourishment at all now. So then we should call the Calcutta <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>. Prabhupāda's not being able to maintain his program. So we'll call the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> from Calcutta, Śrīla Prabhupāda, because now you are not able to keep to the program which he fixed up. And this other <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he can't do anything this difficult. Usually by this time you've drank about 400 cc's of liquid or more. Today you haven't even drank 100 cc's yet. So in this way you will go back to about two or three weeks ago, when you were planning to depart. So that's a little premature, because we agreed that we will first go through with this program which the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has given. So now it seems like it's too difficult to do that, so we should call him so that he can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use of calling him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The use of calling is that he... According to him... This is what I understood. The main problem you're feeling is that you have no strength. This is the sum and substance. There's no strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how he can give strength?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How can he give strength? Just like <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja</span> is for giving strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Makara-dhvaja</span> was not giving strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that was not <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja.</span> That <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> said that was not <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> And he also said that in your condition now you can't take <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot take anything. I feel comfort only lying down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> You can take something lying down, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Just a little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. Then should we give you some more after half an hour? Then you have to take it more frequently then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> (whispering) But he won't do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. This is comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but this is not the road to recovery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we have to do something. We have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that means... That means force me and give me trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that we won't do. But I'm suggesting that if we call the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> in Calcutta, he can suggest some medicine which will give you strength. I mean he has not given you any medicines which he claims will give you strength yet. At least we should give him an opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think it's a good idea to call <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> from Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We're all in agreement that the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> should be called from Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he'll do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Well, that's up to him, to decide what to do. We don't know what he will do, but he has medicines which can give you strength. He wanted to wait some time before administering. But now what would be the loss if he administered them to you now? If they're going to work five days from now, they'll work now. Let us try. There's no loss. And if you get strength, then all gain. The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> said that the one great quality that you have in this sickness is your incredible willpower. If you lose your willpower, desire to remain here, then nothing will work. But he said that if you continue with this strong desire to remain, then it will be easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That strong desire has now disappeared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? One thing is that this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>'s medicine has never had any adverse effects. Everybody else's medicine has had some adverse effects except for his. And in fact, the thing which he said his medicine would do has been done. He said that his medicine would cause you to pass more urine, and that actually has happened. He did not say that the medicine he gave you would make you stronger at this time. So nothing has gone wrong by taking his medicine, and in fact, what he said would happen has happened. He said that after giving that, he would begin to give medicine for giving strength. So what is the harm if we call him and let him give the medicine which he says will give you strength? If it gives you strength, then welcome. And if it doesn't give you strength, then we're not any worse off than we are now. You are feeling hopeless; therefore it doesn't matter to you. But as we are hopeful still, therefore it matters very much to us. He is our last hope. We have to admit, if his medicine does not work, then we simply have to depend solely on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Also this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>, he wants to render you some service. It's his desire that he be allowed to render some service to Your Divine Grace. He wants that opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he requested us that if such a time as this which now is happening were to come, we should immediately call him, that he would drop everything and come. So why should we not give him that chance to come, if we are still hopeful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can. But I am...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We know that you are hopeless, Śrīla Prabhupāda, but as your disciples, it is our duty to remain hopeful, at least to the point where we should try this last <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> We also accept that if this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is not successful, then finish with all <span class="Italic">kavirājas</span> and medicines. (pause) Would you like to have some <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break] The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is here now. <span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span> is here.</div>
