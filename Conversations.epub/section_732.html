<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is recommended. First of all <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> recommends that if you want this thing you worship this deity, this deity. In this way, at last it is said that you can get anything if you worship Kṛṣṇa. That is said. <span class="Italic">Akāmaḥ sarvo kāma v mokṣa kāma udara dhī tivreṇa bhakti-yogena.</span> That is for the purpose that if he wants to take advantage, material benefit from Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> will be there, gradually they will forget this material benefit.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> It appears that we came to Kṛṣṇa consciousness even though we were in a very low stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the process, but if somebody comes to Kṛṣṇa with some material motive, he also becomes... [break] ...civilization and other civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, let us first describe what is civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Let us, I mean, think about what is first civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Civilization means advance from animal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the difference between other civilizations and Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? So what is that difference, that I am asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are advanced from animal life to a higher life, spiritual life. That is Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is I am asking. Civilization means not animal. Man, human being, must not be animal. This is the basic principle of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Primary all are animals. They have to advance from animal life to further up. That is the civilization as you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I say. So not to remain animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, not to have status quo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still it is going on. The <span class="Italic">junglis,</span> they are not called civilized. They are as good as animals. In India we say <span class="Italic">jungli he, jungli.</span> And others say uncivilized. So Aryan, Aryan means the most civilized group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But presently, sir, the Aryan race are spread the world over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Right from... Aryans are spread the world over right from South America to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were, they were belonging to the Aryan family. The Europeans, they were also Aryan family, and Indians, the Arabians, Persians, they were all Aryan family. And the Americans they also migrated from Europe. They are also Aryans. But that is familywise. But actually Aryan means one who is advanced in civilization. That is Aryan. Therefore when Kṛṣṇa chastised Arjuna, He addressed him, "non-Aryan." "You are not talking like Aryan." <span class="Italic">Anārya juṣṭam.</span> "You are talking like non-Aryan." (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So Aryan means advanced. The first-class civilized men are the Aryans. So that standard of Aryan civilization is to understand God, Viṣṇu, and go back to. This is perfectional. <span class="Italic">Yato vā imani (indistinct) bhūtāni jayante.</span> To understand it. And again return back to Him. The modern civilization, they are completely unaware of God, neither they know it that going back to home, back to Godhead, is perfection of civilization. This is the defect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say, sir, that the Aryan civilization, cradle of Aryan civilization near the North Pole, is somewhere in Russia. From there they started transmigrating. People went to Europe, from there to America, then south down to Iran, and then to India and all that. When they have such extreme cold they were able to civilize themselves to that extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? We don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Eskimos are not able to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Civilization means they must live in a nice place like India. That is civilization. The America in those days, they were neglecting. Nobody was living there. Gradually they advanced. Otherwise these tracts of land were rejected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These tracts of land, North America, that was rejected by the Aryans. They knew it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say the Mexico was known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mexico, they are less civilized. They are not Aryans. They are not Aryans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is <span class="Italic">patala bhumī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Patala bhumī</span> means just opposite the eastern hemisphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Just opposite the?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eastern hemisphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they had, sir, a very big Inca civilization in southern part of the American, I mean, continent, South America, that had been ransacked by these fellows, Spaniards. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> ...that Rāvaṇa's brother, Mahirāvaṇa, was in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brazil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Brazil?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. From the description it appears.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They could have gone via the Berings, on other side of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By Suranga.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bering, Bering, just near on the eastern end of Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Underground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is just next, I mean, Alaska and Bering, opposite each other. They could have gone by that place to American continent in past.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's what the scientists say. They are saying that they migrated by the northern way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. That is the only way. Otherwise seas are very big waves. The small crafts could not travel on that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...proposition is not migrating. That is due to increase of population. The civilization means the culture. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> [break] ...really spread toward the east in Indonesia and Indochina, all those places, which were again overtaken by Islam later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Islam is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> History, it has spread. Even Bali Islands today are practicing Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Aryan means change in consciousness to God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This means all over the world there can be an Aryan culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Today the world is dominated by Aryans, all over practically. Except in Central Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today the whole world is dominated by demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Today. The Aryans have become demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That... Anyone can become demon. A demon can become Aryan, and Aryan can become demon by culture. That is one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> can be generated to Rāvaṇa state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the Aryan culture.</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya hi yad lakṣanaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>proktaṁ varṇābhivyañjakam<br class="calibre2"/>yady anyātrāpi dṛṣyeta<br class="calibre2"/>tat tenaiva vinirdiṣet<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 7.11.35]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">That who is Aryan? These are the symptoms of Aryan. If the symptoms are found in Mexico, they are Aryan. That is verdict of Nārada. <span class="Italic">Yady anyātrāpi dṛṣyeta tat tenaiva vinirdiṣet</span> [SB 7.11.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are doing that. They are coming from <span class="Italic">mleccha</span> family, but they have practiced to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> they are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This is Aryan culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they are Aryans originally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This you are calculating from the skin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no skin. From the blood group. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Blood or skin, the same thing. The same thing. The same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All the Aryans have got B blood group in majority of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Skin comes from the blood. You know better than..., medical practitioner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Skin is nourished by blood. It comes from something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not the way. When there is symptoms... The symptom is... First symptom is that he must know that he is not body, and he must know what is God. Then it is Aryan civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātma-niṣṭha</span> and <span class="Italic">īśvara-niṣṭha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. And <span class="Italic">yasyātmā-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke, sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuṇape</span> is a dead body. <span class="Italic">Kuṇape tri-dhātuke.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is dead. What is this body? It is already dead. Just like motorcar. It is dead lump of matter. So long the driver is, it is moving. Similarly, the body is dead. So without understanding of spiritual identification, simply decorating this body means <span class="Italic">aprāṇasya hi dehasya mandanam loka-rañjanam.</span> This is going on, <span class="Italic">loka-rañjanam,</span> just to captivate some foolish person that they are advanced in civilization. What is that civilization? But we can understand, this civilization and the dog, there is no difference. There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now there will be no difference because there is just like dogs, the society, no marriages and all those... We talked yesterday. There are facts. That is going on everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Na te vidu svārtha-gati hi viṣṇu durāśay ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Bahir-artha,</span> bodily concept, this is <span class="Italic">bahiḥ.</span> And <span class="Italic">antar</span> is the soul. So they are <span class="Italic">bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> These rascals are <span class="Italic">bahir-artha-māninaḥ,</span> simply studying this body externally, <span class="Italic">bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> Very nice words, selected words, are used in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, sir, this body and the soul are complimentary. If there is no body, soul cannot reside anywhere. And if there is no soul, body will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is another side of bodily conception. Soul is without... <span class="Italic">Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> "The soul has nothing to do with this material world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. You are absolutely right, sir. But if there is no soul in the body, what will happen to the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If there is no soul in the body, then body is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. That we are pointing out, that without soul, this body has no meaning. It is a lump of matter. But you are saying that without this lump of matter, the soul cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. I don't say that. But so far as the body is living, soul has got to be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If there is no soul inside, what will happen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Body requires the soul for movement, but soul does not require the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Soul creates a body to fulfill...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Soul creates in this sense: by his <span class="Italic">karma</span> he has to accept, accept a certain type of body. But originally he doesn't require this material world. <span class="Italic">Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> And that is self-realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The production of the body in the cosmos is the <span class="Italic">līlā</span> of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> It is compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Why compulsory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if a man is beaten with shoes, that is not his <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is force, that "You must be beaten with shoes." That is not <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> Nobody says, "Let me play this <span class="Italic">līlā</span> and you beat me with shoes." (laughter) No sane man will do that. When a man is punished, that is by force, superior force. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is force, <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> nature's. You cannot say that "I don't care for the <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span>" <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Prakṛtir me aṣṭadhā.</span> It is God's <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The matter, material nature, is forced upon him. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is accepting different bodies according to the contamination of material nature. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya.</span> That he does not know. <span class="Italic">Ahāṅkara-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not know that there is a superior <span class="Italic">karta, daiva netreṇa. Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa jantu deha upapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So he is forced to accept a certain kind of body by the material nature. That he does not know. This is non-Aryan. Like dog. He does not know that why he has got this dog's body. He simply has learned how to bark, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) I have my doubts. How can we know that he is not knowing or knowing? It is our conjecture that he is not knowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says. You conjecture, but we don't conjecture. We simply repeat what is said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. </span>Śāstra-cakṣuṣāt. "Your eyes should be the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> not conjecture." <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya.</span> He has become a dog on account of his infection with certain type of material qualities. That is our eyes. We don't conjecture anything. It is naturally may be inquired that "Why one living entity has got this body of a dog and why one living entity has got the body of King Indra?" The <span class="Italic">śāstra-cakṣuṣāt: kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya. Śāstra</span> says, Kṛṣṇa says. So it is, reason is, that he has infected the certain type of material modes of nature; therefore he has got. It is very easy. As you, medical man, you know how the disease has come, you have infected the disease. It is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ ganga</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāraṇam. Kāraṇam,</span> yes. I am layman. I cannot say why I have got this fever. You can... By analysis, you can say. So therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra-cakṣuṣāt. Śāstra</span> says, "You analyze his blood, and if these symptoms are there, therefore this disease is there." That is <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> not conjecture. You don't diagnose by simply imagining. No. That is not scientific treatment. You analyze blood, stool and this, and find out what is the germ. Then you analyze. And in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> the symptoms are there, analytical, that "This kind of disease, the symptoms will be this, this, this, this." That is <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> not conjecture. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇa guṇa-saṅgo 'sya,</span> very nicely explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, that "This rascal has infected this body on account of his particular connection with the modes of material nature." In the <span class="Italic">smṛti-śāstra</span> it is stated how one gets tuberculosis, how one gets this disease, that disease, different <span class="Italic">pāpa.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...culture should be designed to cure the material disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Aryan culture. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Aryan culture. But they do not know what is <span class="Italic">punar janma,</span> how we can stop this birth and death, nothing of the sort. Simply dogs and cats, that's all, jumping, very busy. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That's all. Immediately the verdict: "Oh, he does not know anything. He's as good." So? Everything is going nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. I just came from Bangalore last night. They are having a very big program there and a lot of publicity from the newspapers with pictures and nice articles, big articles on the front page of the newspapers there. And tomorrow the governor is coming as the chief guest for the program. He was... He had that Sunday-that is tomorrow-he was fixed on going to Sai Baba's conference, but when we went to see him he was very pleased because he had gone to our Vṛndāvana temple just ten days back, so he was very much enthused with our activities and he liked the temple very much. So he was very pleased and he said, "Yes, I will cancel Sai Baba's program and come to your program."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the governor of Karnataka?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. He was the chief minister of Rajastan previously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, some governor went to our temple, I heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Akṣayānanda wrote to me. Governor of Karnataka State.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is a good response, that after seeing our temple he decided to attend our conference. That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> The boys are selling more than fifteen hundred rupees' worth of books, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bangalore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. And the most popular book there now is that <span class="Italic">Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.</span> Everyone, everyone is buying. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They wanted us to print <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of copies of that book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can get it printed in India now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And in that book we have mentioned that Darwin's theory is completely bogus. In Europe and America also we are getting good response, very.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Also another party of five devotees, they have started on the bullock cart <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> going village to village. But it's very austere. They were... I told them, "You go for two months, come back after two months." But they returned in six days. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Because first of all, they did not know how to ride the bulls, so the bulls gave a lot of trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no professional driver?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Well, now we are going to hire one driver to take care of the bulls. And secondly, even the axle of the cart was a little defective. Otherwise the program was a great success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is success. People were coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. And one person came to the temple in Hyderabad and met me. He said that "After your devotees had a program in our village, the farmers in the evening they were coming and doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> instead of just..." Previously they were not doing anything, but now they are coming after farming. In the evening they are collecting and they are doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how quickly there will be response. Therefore I was insisting, "Go village to village, town to town." Caitanya Mahāprabhu's prediction, <span class="Italic">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Grāma,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it will never be foiled. Let us now begin village to village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> People in the villages, they are innocent, but they have been infected with so many vices. They are all drinking toddy every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll... If they chant, they will forget it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. And the government is pushing toddy sales because they make money on it. They make tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They want money, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> So they want to encourage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And now they're bringing prohibition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Where? Only in Madras there is now.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the government is now thinking of seriously, to stop. If the government simply prohibits these four things-meat-eating, and drinking, gambling, and illicit sex-the whole country will change immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> A couple of months back there was an article in the papers that the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh is going to ban all gambling activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> So I wrote back a letter to the chief minister requesting him that he has made a very good step and he should try and restrict all the four sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did he reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> No, he never replied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This animal civilization, <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ,</span> is going as civilization-drinking, meat-eating, gambling. This is less than animal civili... Animals do not play gambling, at least. They have illicit sex, but no gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> They cannot have intoxication either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh, yes, drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That sugar, they say that the ants they are very intoxicants; therefore they like sugar. Sugar is intoxication. Wine is made from sugar. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. Molasses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Molasses. Ferment molasses with sulphuric acid and then distill. It is wine, liquor. People are producing unnecessary quantity of sugarcane; therefore the drinking habit is increasing. Because from sugar the molasses is the by-product, so they have to use. They are finding out what is next industry, and the next industry is liquor, wine. So when they produce more wine, then they must sell, and the people must drink. This is going on, one after another. And in Hawaii, Mauritius and in so many other places we see they have produced unnecessary quantity of sugarcane. And then molasses... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. And then wine, and they must be sold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So this is sinful activity, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All sinful activity. <span class="Italic">Ugra-karma.</span> And if you drink wine, then you must require meat. Otherwise your liver function will be bad. There must be lump of meat. And as soon as wine and meat combine, then you require illicit sex. It is one after another. This is scientific. So we stop immediately: "Stop these four principles." Then one will be free from sinful life. Then he'll understand what is God. Otherwise not possible. A sinful man cannot understand what is God. Why the whole world is godless? On account of the sinful life, they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So the means of production have to be changed into pious type of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you stop sinful activities, the production will automatically stop. If there is no market for wine, then it will stop automatically. So you stop drinking, and the market for liquor will stop. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So we can return. [break] ...has not come today? He is entangled with his grandson.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> What is that?</div>

Again sex, again sex, again sex. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...now we have about sixteen to eighteen thousand kg's of rice stocked up. We just harvested all the rice. We got a fairly good yield, not exceptionally good because it was our first attempt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your invested money is realized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. If we sell that, we can get at least double.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "If we sell" means you sell it. First of all take whatever you invested, money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, that is what I was thinking. Sell what we invested and distribute the rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> daily. So they are coming for <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Few people are coming, but there are not so many devotees there to have a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Organize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...big program. Yes. And all the devotees who are there are very new, all new recruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how we are going to organize?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Well, Haṁsadūta said as soon as the land is transferred he would send ten devotees for the farm. So then I think it will start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to import devotees. You cannot create devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> We have got about eight devotees there who are new, but they are not experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Train them, train them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To give a manager right way, Haṁsadūta said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He can give a manager for the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. If we get a manager, then we can manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you do not get a manager, then what is the use of taking the land? If you cannot manage, then what is the use of taking? Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They will come. So why you are not giving that <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>? Every day there must be huge <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Whatever you grow, you use it for <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...thing produced, that should be used as <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And they will chant. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. If that program is not done, then what is the use of taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> We have plenty of rice now, and also the <span class="Italic">dahl</span> will be harvested in about fifteen, twenty days. And the village people, this is their normal food, rice and <span class="Italic">dahl.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> So we can distribute to all the villagers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Distribute rice and <span class="Italic">dahl</span> and little vegetables, and they will come, take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Also this bullock cart party can recruit many persons from villagers to come and stay at the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is first business, that they should join this movement and eat <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...food, they have begun spinning their own cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Most of the land at the farm is black cotton soil, very favorable for growing cotton. So a piece of that we can take, ten acres or so for growing cotton, and spin our own cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is required. Why purchasing cloth, twenty-two rupees per pair? No? What is the charge nowadays?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> It's about three, four rupees per meter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> For two <span class="Italic">dhotīs</span> you'd need fifteen rupees.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> The structure is over, Prabhupāda. Now the ornamental work is started since last fifteen days. They said they could finish it by March, but I don't know if we'll be able to push it before that. Since last one month the collections have also increased. So if the collections go on in the same speed as we are going now, it may be finished by March. But otherwise definitely by August it will be complete. [break] ...fifteenth of this month Indira Gandhi was in Hyderabad. I got a letter from Praghoṣa that there were <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of people there to see her, and we have printed up coupons which we go shop to shop and tell everyone that "You buy one brick for the temple. So eleven rupees is the cost of one brick. So in your name one brick must be put." So we have these coupons, and they distributed six thousand rupees' worth of coupons in that program. Six hundred coupons they distributed in that meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Sell well." You know he is "sell well" man. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Sell a brick for the temple. Well, one person got the book, and he came the next day and he wanted to become a member. He was convinced. And Acyutānanda says that this is for the atheistic people who cannot understand God, so here we are proving scientifically that God exists and how Kṛṣṇa is the supreme scientist. So materialists, there are so many materialistic people, they always like these kind of books, so they are buying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The next book will also be a big hit, I think, that these scientists are preparing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Daily there are at least 2,000 to 2,2500 people coming to the program. There would be more if there was more space, but it's an enclosed hall, so we can't fit in more people. It's packed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a lot bigger than it was three months ago?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh, yes. We have very big publicity. And we get letters from different parts of Karnataka inviting us for programs in their villages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you do that. [break] Some big man came to see me for cooperating with others like Chinmayananda and Vinoda Bhave. </div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, cooperation on the basis of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. If they are actually serious preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then there is cooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Recently Chinmayananda had a big program in Hyderabad for twelve days. He spoke on the twelfth chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but he never mentioned the name of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> And last year when he had come, he said in his first lecture that "We will accept those verses now which are suitable, and those which are not suitable, we will reject them." He wants to reject Kṛṣṇa's authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we reject them. At once we reject it. Yes. These Māyāvādīs, they know that if they accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, then their Māyāvādī philosophy is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> And those of the Vivekananda or Ramakrishna <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> there is only one senior devotee that they have now, he is the president of the Hyderabad branch. His name is Ranganath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Ranganath, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> And one day one of our regular devotees, he went to see him and said, "What about in America there are so many people, they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?" So he says, "In America also there are many fools." So he is blaspheming like this, how can we cooperate with such people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we cannot cooperate. But if there is meeting we can prove them that they are fools. (laughter) That's all. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> That is required. Actually, that is the potency of your teaching is so powerful. I have seen that every time someone makes this poor excuses in front of people... Just like yesterday I was in the train, and one guy was saying exactly the same thing, that "I believe in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in my own way." So I opened up <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and I showed to four people, "Look here, just see what Kṛṣṇa is saying here." And all of them agreed. They said, "Yes, yes. You are right and he is wrong." All of them. He said that "I believe in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in my own way." I said, "Are you the controller of the sun and the moon and the stars and the planets?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh yes, we all... Just two, three days back we went to see that Śaṅkarācārya of Kamakochi(?), and the old Śaṅkarācārya, he was very nice. He said, "Oh, you are doing very nice work," and he liked us very much. But then the young Śaṅkarācārya, he didn't say anything, but he had one <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> near him who started, who first questioned us that "Do you know Sanskrit?" So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why did you not, "Do you know English?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> So first of all Acyutānanda... I wasn't there, but Acyutānanda and Yaśodānanda said, "No, we don't know much San... A little bit. We don't..." So he quoted, "<span class="Italic">Sarva dharmān...</span> Do you know that verse?" So they said, "Yes." So he said, "Explain what is the meaning of that verse." He started the whole conversation. We didn't want to get into any philosophical argument. So they started explaining what is the meaning, one must surrender to Kṛṣṇa. And then it went on, who is Kṛṣṇa. And then finally Acyutānanda and Yaśodānanda were quoting so many <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> that they were completely baffled, and the whole crowd that was there, they were appreciating, and we were defeating them. By every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> we were defeating them, and they were completely baffled. Ultimately he said-he could not fight back-so he said, "Swamiji, you are right," and he wanted to close the whole conversation because the people were gaining our side. They were being convinced by our <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They were completely shocked that they knew so many Sanskrit <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> from so many different scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Western learned circle, they are admitting that the greatest contribution of Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is these authentic translation of Vedic literature. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

You all do <span class="Italic">bhajan...</span>" They call us <span class="Italic">bhajan mandali.</span> Then when we started preaching to them, showing them the philosophy, the books and all the activities that we are doing all over the world, they were really, they were shocked. They said, "Oh, we never knew you were doing so much." And they said there is no other organization which is comprising of all the different kinds of activities, all kinds of welfare and spiritual activities that we are doing. If we just had many preaching parties and go all over and show people what all the activities that we are doing, people will accept us. They will know more about our movement.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] What did he speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He spoke on different verses, one by one, of the twelfth chapter. But no conclusion. Every lecture there was no conclusion. So he leaves the people in a blank. There is no conclusion to any of his lectures. And his philosophy is "<span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> means black. Black means unknown. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is unknown. Kṛṣṇa is unknown. We cannot know Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what about others' version who knows Kṛṣṇa? Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu or all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas?</span> (end)</div>
