<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> In fact, the word "London" is coming from the Latin word londonium. Londonium was a small fishing fort that the Roman's founded on the Thames.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You are not sufficiently covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I'm all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are not all right. (pause) [break] Indian civilization is that they constructed big, big buildings, but for God, Kṛṣṇa, temple. And for the people, they were satisfied in small villages. So far the temples are concerned, South Indian temple, wonderful temple. (aside:) Not so near. Mostly Viṣṇu temple. We shall go this side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Tokyo there is a park, this sound was there. (sound of birds chirping) Cement, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And fish combined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, seahorse. Did such an animal exist, seahorse? Or is this man's imagination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, seahorse we have heard, there is. Sea elephant, seahorse, there are. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...fighting and all kinds of games. Four boys died that year trying to... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and Roman climate the same? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Rome is a little warmer, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Now the whole city is a little more humid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It's sunny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Sunnier than London. Very close to London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Not cold like London ever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is snow. [break] ...and Darjeeling. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Anthropomorphic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anthropomorphic. That means man worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They deify a man. He's a man but the people make him as a god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say that about Kṛṣṇa, that Kṛṣṇa was a man, and then later His followers deified Him. That man wrote that in that pamphlet, Dr. Bannerjee, in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he has said like that? <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā manuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> So why they do not deify others? Only Kṛṣṇa. There were many big, big men. All the Pāṇḍavas were very big men. Kṛṣṇa was contemporate to the Pāṇḍavas. Why Kṛṣṇa was picked up, and not the Pāṇḍavas? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The Pāṇḍavas were the devotees of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This Anthropomorphism cannot be applied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Their activities were not so great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, nobody's activities can be greater than God's activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There was that lady who came to see you yesterday who asked that "Lord Jesus performed so many miracles. So what miracles did Kṛṣṇa perform?" So your reply was so many miracles, killing Putana and so on. But that was five thousand years ago. Kṛṣṇa's not here today. And people will ask, "Well we cannot see these miracles. So how can we accept Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Well they can't see Jesus's miracles either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) They can see the miracles of Jesus Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They will accept anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All such questions. No sober questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Kṛṣṇa's miracles are in the hearts of devotees today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Kṛṣṇa's miracle is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone can see. Who has given such information? All practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There are so many scriptures all over the world, but just in the second chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa gives more knowledge than all of the other scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. It is the greatest miracle. These trees, not fruit trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...is that "Okay, you present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as being the evidence for Kṛṣṇa, but so many people interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So where is the proof that it is miraculous if so many people debate it?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they will debate? If they debate like rascal, that is another thing. If they debate like sane man, then there cannot be any difference of opinion. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> So what is your debate on this point, that living entities, they flourish by food grains? So what is your debate on this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, they may agree that the teachings are good, but they can't accept it as proof that Kṛṣṇa was God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, then you have to give me definition of God. What is God? If you know God, then you can say that "Kṛṣṇa is not God." Otherwise, how you can say He is not God? I give you a piece of gold: If you say, "It is not gold," then you show me what is gold. Otherwise, you are talking nonsense. If you do not know the things as it is, how you can say, "It is not this"? If you know the positive, then you can say the negative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, there are many people who say that they have actually experienced God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that God? Tell me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, it's like the Guru Maharaji people. They say they've seen Guru Maharaji lifting Govardhana Hill and displaying universal form and so many miracles. They say they have seen Guru Maharaji doing all the miracles that Kṛṣṇa claims to have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa, when Kṛṣṇa is present, when He lifted the Govardhana Hill, everyone saw. Where is your rascal Guru Mahārāja doing that, everyone can see? When Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, He lifted the Govardhana Hill. All the inhabitants saw it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...arising from Kṛṣṇa's pastimes proves that atheists cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Because they are atheists, they don't want to accept Him as God. Therefore they will not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atheist do not accept God anywhere. So atheist is different thing. Atheist is atheist. <span class="Italic">Āsuriṁ. Āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> Atheist has no knowledge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> ...control the whole of Rome. They own nearly all the businesses. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...a few enjoying very much. In the whole city, a lot of parks, a lot of amphitheaters and that is how they went to ruin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Luxury leads to poverty. American luxury or European luxury leading to these hippies' poverty. Voluntarily they are accepting poverty. Opposite. Sometimes this side, sometimes that side. Pendulum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> What is that? (loud noise from birds)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cranes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Cranes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The zoo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Those are pelicans, with the big bag underneath. And there are some South American animals, llamas. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...fight with tiger and elephants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Lions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> They would use a trident and a net and they would try to throw the net over the lion and fight the lion like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And kill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> And kill, yes. They would arm themselves with a helmet and some protection here for their arms and sometimes for their chest, and then they would attack with the trident. [break] Earlier Claudius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> For enjoyment they would even put two gladiators fighting each other, two men killing each other, and they would all watch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. That was in India also, that Kaṁsa's wrestling with Kṛṣṇa. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Was that to the death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It comes automatically to death. Although it is not meant. Nobody will agree that "I am defeated." Therefore death. There must be death. What is this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> This is a mock mountain-top for the goats and for other wild animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, this is artificial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There's one. There's a goat. (end)</div>
