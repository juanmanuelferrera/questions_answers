<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...when you talk to them of going to the spiritual world they say they would believe if there was someone present that has come back to tell them of the spiritual world. But otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he will believe that someone has come? The first, next question will be, how you will believe. I will present a man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They don't believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of bringing that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> We tell them that you have come, (Prabhupāda laughs) but they'll not accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have come and that I shall think over. First of all let me know how you will believe. Suppose if I say, "I have come from spiritual world," will he believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That's what I'm saying. No, they don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the method of his believing I must know. Then I present the man. What is the method of believing? Otherwise I can say, "I have come from spiritual world. You believe me." Will he believe it? Will he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, I would, but I do not think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you may, you are my disciple. You may believe. But will he believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No, he will not believe, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let me know first of all how he will believe. Then according to his belief, I shall bring man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> By seeing some miracles, they will believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Someone with three heads possibly, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is sometimes a child is born with three heads. Sometimes it is. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">idaṁ te na atapaskāya.</span> Those who have no life of penance and austerities, don't talk with them. It will be a waste of time. You know that there is verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> In Eighteenth Chapter. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ te na atapaskāya, māṁ ca yaḥ abhyasūyati:</span> "Persons who are envious of Me and those who have not undergone austerity and penances, don't talk with them." But we take the risk. We go even to these rascals. Because for Kṛṣṇa's sake, "Never mind, it will take some time. Let me try this rascal." Therefore the easiest process is that every rascal will agree to take nice food and dance. So induce them to come to us, dance, and take nice food. Let them come on this ground. And by hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa, gradually they will be all right. This is the policy. So far argument, logic, philosophy is concerned, they are beyond... Because they are animal. They cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You have it's just like when someone has jaundice and he sees everything as yellow and you cannot convince him if something is white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He must become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore, the treatment is, some way or other, induce them to come and chant and dance with us and take prasādam. This program should be accelerated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Spiritual life starts with the tongue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is... <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Like, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the solicitor there last night. When I first made contact with him, he took two days to think about it whether he would act for us or not. And now, through association, he's becoming more purified, stopped eating meat, stopped smoking cigarettes, and now he likes us very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is being purified himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span>. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to take little patience. That is preaching work. Don't be impatient. Let us do our duty on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. Even the result is not very appreciable, still we have to do it. This is preaching. Just like Nityānanda Prabhu. He was hurt by Jagāi-Mādhāi. Still, He determined, "No, these two boys must be delivered." This is the example. "Never mind, they have injured Me; still, I shall deliver them." And He did it. They became Vaiṣṇava. So our preaching determination should be like that, not that we are failure in some cases, and therefore give it up. No. This is our business. We must go on doing this. Failure or success, it doesn't matter. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said to preach. He never said, "If you are failure, don't preach." Never said that. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha, tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa: [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128] "Whomever you meet, you just give him the instruction of Kṛṣṇa." He never says that "If somebody does not hear you, don't do it." No. Kṛṣṇa said that "Don't talk with the fools and rascals and those who are not undergone some penances."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Kṛṣṇa said. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so kind. He said, "To everyone say."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> So we are following Lord Caitanya's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like I came to western country with no hope. I knew that my Godbrother, Bon Mahārāja, came, he failed. Then Gosvāmī Mahārāja was there, so many swamis and yogis came here, nobody could turn them. So I came here just with a purpose, "Let me try." But I was not hopeful at all. But Kṛṣṇa's grace, it is now successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> A great success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore let us try. And success, no success, depend on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Already I have noticed a difference with the new temple which has opened in Melbourne, with the group of adults that are coming around to become interested now because we have a permanent place here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the whole, we have got very nice house. (Prabhupāda gets out of car and is greeted by devotees) Thank you. (end)</div>
