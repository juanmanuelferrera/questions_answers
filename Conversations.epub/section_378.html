<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...technological college. Similarly, this is another college, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> For the public in general?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. Anyone. Just like engineering college is open for anyone. He must be ready to take up the training. Similarly, this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college, he must be ready, the student, must be ready to take up the training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Would it be for a particular age group?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, any education, from childhood. Yes. Education means from childhood. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha [SB </span>7.6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The... How... We are getting so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they should teach. Teaching should be done by the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> Just like in missionary school, the fathers teaches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> How would it be different than <span class="Italic">gurukula?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> How would it differ from <span class="Italic">gurukula?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> is only for the small children. Preliminary, primary. And when the children are grown up, they should be sent to the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> school or college for further developed training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They should... Should they be taught also some... Should there also be teaching in some particular skill or <span class="Italic">varṇa?</span> Such as say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Say, for example, someone was a, a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> by inclination, or a...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, inclination can be changed also. If one has got little ad... But we should take little advantage of the inclination. Not that... That is to be decided by the... Inclination or no inclination, we can... That will be done. That is not very difficult. This is a most important item. Because people have been spoiled all over the world by being misguided by the so-called leaders. Therefore <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college is required. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But Prabhupāda, I'm still not quite clear. In other words, we'd teach, for example, like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> How much would be expected of the students as far as...? Would they live with us and follow the four principles? Like that? Or just come for classes or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Come to classes you won't get. Because nobody has got any taste for such thing. A boarding school or boarding college would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Boarding school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And there should... Should there be any material subject matters taught like in <span class="Italic">gurukula?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like material subject matter, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> or the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriya,</span> as they are described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> what are the symptoms of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> what is the symptoms of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> should be taught how to fight also. There will be military training. There will be training how to kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> should be trained how to give protection to the cows, how to till the field and grow food. Practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Not business also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> The <span class="Italic">vaiśyas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Business, this rascal business, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Business means if you have got extra grains or extra foodstuff, you can sell where there is necessity, there is want. That is business. We are not going to open mills and factories and... No. We are not going to do that. That is <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> business. The real business is that you produce enough food grains, as much as possible, and you eat and distribute. That's all. This is business. He does not require any so high technical education. Anyone can till the ground and grow food. Is it difficult? This is the business. The first thing is that everyone, man and animal, especially the cows, they must be properly fed so become very stout and strong. Cows will supply milk, and man will work hard, without being suffered by dysentery. He must work hard. Any capacity. Work as a teacher or work as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> work as a ploughman. Or work as general assistant. He must work. Everyone should be employed. And his employment will be provided from any of these groups, according to his capacity. Either as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> or as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> or as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> or as a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> What kind of training is there for a <span class="Italic">śūdra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdra</span> is general assistant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh, just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Order-carrier. He has no intelligence. He doesn't require intelligence. "Do this." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> What would he learn at the school, though?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> What would his business be at that <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is also training, to become obedient. Because people are not obedient. What are these hippies? They are not obedient. So obedience also require training. If you have no intelligence, if you cannot do anything independently, just be obedient to the other, higher three classes. That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He must agree to abide by the orders of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriyas, vaiśya.</span> That's all. So that nobody will be unemployed. Everyone should be trained up to sleep six to eight hours and attend meeting, chant, and <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> And balance-he must work hard. Not that sleeping unlimitedly. There is no limit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> What class does the arts and crafts come under?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? <span class="Italic">Śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Little arts and crafts can be trained up to the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> They, at the present moment, they have given too much stress on the arts and crafts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the whole people, population, is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a... That is the difficulty. All people are being drawn by giving them, I mean to say, attraction for high salary, and they are taking so-called technical education, and all of them working in the factory. Nobody's working on the field. They are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> ...artist is accepted as a philosopher in life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In our society [break] ...accepted [break] ...as a philosopher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yeah, the artist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Artist is also business of the <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, but in our... I'm saying, in modern society in America, they are considered... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonsense philosophy. They do not know what is the meaning of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, in your western countries the rascals, they are writing philosophy on sex life, which is known by the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is writing so many things. So they are rascals. [break] ...human being. You see. What is this philosophy? Sex life? Even dog knows how to have sex life. And he's writing philosophy. So this kind of philosophy can be appreciated by the rascals and... [break] We do not appreciate that. They are not philosopher. Philosopher means who is searching out the Absolute Truth. That is philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is philosophy. <span class="Italic">Darśana. Darśana</span> means search out what is the ultimate. <span class="Italic">Jñānī ca bharatarṣabha</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 7.16]<span class="Italic">. Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna, ārto 'rthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha, arto 'rthārthī jijñāsur jñānī ca bharatarṣabha.</span> These are philosophers. Even the <span class="Italic">ārtaḥ,</span> even a distressed person, he is praying to the Supreme Authority, "My God, I am very much hungry. Kindly give me my daily bread." He's also philosopher, because he's searching out the Absolute Truth. He's philosopher. Not this Freud rascal, elaborating how to have sex life. So this kind of philosopher, they... What is called? In Bengali: <span class="Italic">vane haye śṛgāla rājā.</span>(?) "In the jungle a jackal becomes a king." So because western people, they have no... They're all less than <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> So a Freud has become a philosopher. <span class="Italic">Vane haye śṛgāla rājā.</span> "In the jungle, the jackal has become a king." That's all. What is knowledge there? It is that... The whole western world is going on for industry, for making money, eat, drink, be merry, wine and women. That's... They're all less than <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> This is the first time attempt is being made to make them human beings. Don't mind. I am using very strong words. That is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It's true. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, they are little animals with four hand, two legs, two hand, hand animals. That's all. Yes. Rejected them. Vedic civilization rejected them, <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas.</span> But they can be reformed. The process is the same. Not that because they are rejected, they cannot be reclaimed. They can be reclaimed also. Just like you are being done. Although you are coming from the <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas,</span> by training, you are becoming more than a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So there is no bar for them. Unfortunately, these rascals do not agree to accept. As soon as you say, "No more illicit sex," oh, they become angry. As soon as I say, "There is no meat-eating," they become angry. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na śamayati</span> (?). The rascals, fools, if you give them good lessons, education, they will be angry. <span class="Italic">Prakopayati na śamayati. Payaḥ pānaṁ bhujaṅgānām</span> (?). The snake, if you give him nice milk and banana, the result will be he will increase his poison. <span class="Italic">Payaḥ pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam.</span> But Kṛṣṇa's grace, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's grace, they are being now trained up. Now you be trained up and revise the whole edition of the western civilization, especially in America. Then a new chapter will come in. This is the program. Therefore <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> school required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So Prabhupāda, in this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college, is it true that there will be no need, for example, for teaching material history and mathematics and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no need. History, we simply read <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> history of the great men, Pāṇḍavas, how they were fighting for the good cause, how they were reigning. That history. Not this rascal history. If you study that history millions of years, what is that history and what you'll learn from that history? You learn history of the really great men, how they worked, how they ruled. That is a... You study history of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Study the history of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. That is required. Not that simply chronological record, all nonsense, and big, big books, and making research. Why should you waste your time in that way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Yes. And so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? History must be for great person. This is history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So in our <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college the students that come to our college, they follow the four principles... They follow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four principles essential. Essential. But only the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> or the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas...</span> Just like <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they have to learn how to kill. So practically, they should go to the forest and kill some animal. And if he likes, he can eat also. If he likes, he can eat also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> What he kills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But not from the slaughterhouse. Those who are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they can, they're allowed sometimes to eat meat. It is understood Bhīma, Bhīma also eating sometimes meat. Bhīma. Amongst the Pāṇḍavas, only Bhīma. Not others. So if the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they want to eat meat, they can be allowed on particular occasions. But they must go to the forest and kill the animal. Not that for meat-eating regular slaughterhouses should be maintained. This is all nonsense, degradation. If you want to eat meat, you go to the forest. And the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they also sometimes eat meat. Or the <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But never the cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Cow... The <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they can take a goat and sacrifice before the deity, goddess Kālī, and then eat. Nobody should be given unrestricted freedom to eat meat. Or wine. If one is adamant to drink wine, then there is <span class="Italic">Caṇḍī-pūjā, Durgā-pūjā.</span> That means restriction. That means restriction. Under certain condition. Similarly, sex life-marriage. That is also sex life, but under condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is this school for women also, or just for men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For men. Women should automatically learn how to cook, how to cleanse home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> So they don't attend <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama</span> college especially meant for the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> Those who are not fit for education, they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> That's all. Or those who are reluctant to take education<span class="Italic">-śūdra</span> means. That's all. They should assist the higher class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Would the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> learn Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Not necessarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Not necessarily. Just more philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I am translating all the books, similarly, any book of knowledge can be translated into different languages. Not that one has to learn Sanskrit. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Not necessary. So in this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college there would be two divisions, <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśr...</span> Learning a materia...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all <span class="Italic">varṇa.</span> And <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> then, when the <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> is perfectly in order, then <span class="Italic">āśrama. Āśrama</span> is specially meant for spiritual advancement, and <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> is general division. It must be there in the human society, or they're on the animals. If <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> is not there, then this is a society of animal. And when the <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> is working perfectly, then we give them <span class="Italic">āśrama. Varṇāśrama.</span> That is later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> First they should be taught a skill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all, the whole society must be divided into four <span class="Italic">varṇas.</span> Otherwise, there will be chaotic condition. That is what is the position now. What is he, what he has to do, one does not know. And there are so many unemployment. But if you organize the society into <span class="Italic">varṇas,</span> there will be no question of unemployment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But from the very beginning there should be taught <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> From the very beginning we should teach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But our, our position is that we are above <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> But for management or ideal society, we are introducing this. We, so far we are concerned, Kṛṣṇa conscious men, we are above <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> But to show the people that we are not escaping, we can take part in any order of life. That is our position. Just like if I brush somebody's shoes, that does not mean I am shoemaker. My position is the same. But to show how to do it... Just like a servant is doing. The master is, "Oh, you cannot do. Just see." Just like I show you sometimes how to mop. So I am not a mopper, but I am showing how to mop. So our position is like that. We do not belong to any <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> But we have to show these rascals. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He, he was perfect Vaiṣṇava, but when he was king, he was fighting like anything. Not that, "Oh, I am now become Vaiṣṇava. I cannot kill." What is this? He killed like anything. When the <span class="Italic">Yakṣas</span> attacked his kingdom, he was killing like anything then the <span class="Italic">Yakṣa-rāja</span> came and asked him to pardon this. He immediately accepted. So he wanted to give him some benediction, that "You are so great that simply on my request, you have stopped killing these rascals, <span class="Italic">Yakṣas.</span> So you can take some benediction from me." He said, "That's all right. Thank you. You give me the benediction that I may be a pure lover of Kṛṣṇa. That's all." This benediction he asked. Although he was so powerful and, the <span class="Italic">Yakṣa-rāja,</span> he could give him the wealth of the whole universe. But he made that, "Thank you very much. You give me this benediction that I may remain a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa." This is Vaiṣṇava. He is doing everything, but his aim is to please Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, even if we take to <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> we do not belong to any... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mayā sṛṣṭam.</span> "I have inaugurated." But Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do with <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> Similarly, if we act as <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> still, we have nothing to do with the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, can you say something about the training for a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are <span class="Italic">satyaṁ śamaḥ damaḥ.</span> He must be truthful, he must control the senses, control the mind... <span class="Italic">śamo damaḥ,...</span> He must be tolerant. He should not be agitated in trifle matters. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ śamo damaḥ śaucam.</span> He must be always clean. Three times he must take bath at least. All the clothing, all, everything is clean. This is brahminical training. And then he must know all what is what, knowledge, and practical application, and firm faith in Kṛṣṇa. This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So what kind of practical work could we engage them in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll be teaching. They'll be all teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh, they'll be teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Droṇācārya. He was <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but he was teaching military art to the Pāṇḍavas. General teacher class will be the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> It doesn't matter what he's teaching. But teaching, perfectly teaching, how to become a military man. Arjuna's fighting was due to Droṇācārya. He learned it from Droṇācārya. He was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> But because he took the position of a teacher, he thought very perfectly. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> should be expert in every kind of knowledge. If requires, he'll become teacher. This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> can teach how to fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> means intelligent, brain. So in intelligent brain one can learn anything and teach anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This is all very new.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This is very new. It seems there'll be many difficulties. So we should try to start this school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the difficulty? If I teach you how to cook, is it very difficult?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, we have to... No, we have to learn, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then similarly, like that. Like that. I am doing that. I am teaching how to mop the floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Then it becomes easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I must know everything because I am a teacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So, for example, if I become a teacher at <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> say, the first teacher at the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college, then I have to also become expert at how to fight, how to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not all of you, but some of you must be, must learn the art of fighting also. But in a practical you are not going to fight. If required, you can fight. I say that we are above all these <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> but we must train others or ourself also for material activities, everything, under these divisions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> For example, in New Vrindaban we have <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> that are very expert at tilling the soil and taking care of cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> And they could travel around and teach others how to do that as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's right. He is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but he's teaching how to take care of the cows and ploughing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It's not that one teacher has to teach everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh, I see. So a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> teacher should become expert in a particular subject and then teach that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh. It's very exciting, Prabhupāda, because all the, at the present time in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the thing is that actually, at the present moment, they are <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> or less than <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> They are not human beings. The whole population of the world. It doesn't matter whether it is western or eastern. That is the position. So unless they are trained up, so the society's already in chaos, and it will go on still more in chaos, chaos. It will be hell. How people will live? And these rascals are being elected as government men, and they're only making budget how to tax. So one side, there is no rain; one side, there is no rice, especially in India; and one side, heavy tax. So they'll be all confused. They have already become confused. So in the confusion state it will be very difficult to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. Therefore preliminary help should be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Preliminary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That they should not be in chaos and confusion. Otherwise, how the brain will work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Yes. No one can give rapt attention without peace of mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Our main aim is how to give them Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But if they are already disturbed in every respect, then how they'll take it? Therefore we are taking these subjects, to help him to come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And this is the method<span class="Italic">-varṇāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So just to clarify, Prabhupāda, I want to make sure I have it very clear, that if someone comes to our <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college, even though this may be preliminary help, in general-you've made some exceptions-but in general, when they come to our college, they have to follow the four regulative principles, also learn something about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and then, side by side, they learn a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four regulative principles compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if some of the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they want, so that is our prescription: "Go to the forest and kill some animal and eat that." That's all. You can kill one boar. Some disturbing elements, you can kill. You can kill some tiger. Like that. Learn to kill. No nonviolence. Learn to kill. Here also, as soon as you'll find, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> a thief, a rogue, unwanted element in the society, kill him. That's all. Finish. Kill him. <span class="Italic">Bās.</span> Finished. So other will see, "Oh, the ruler is very strong." And others will... One killing will be lesson for many hundreds and thousands. No mercy. "Kill him." That's all. That was the system. In Kashmir about hundred years ago. If somebody has stolen, cut his hand. <span class="Italic">Bās.</span> He cannot steal any more. So one cutting hand means finish. In that part of the world, no more stealing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> How would the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> kill the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> How would they kill? With guns or bow and arrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, as it is suitable. It is not that because the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> were killing by bows and arrows formerly, you have to continue that. That is another foolishness. If you have got... If you can kill easily by guns, take that gun. Just like formerly, <span class="Italic">parivrāja,</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu walked on the street. There was no aeroplane or... Or he did not use it. Does it mean that I shall have to follow that? I must take the jet engine. If it is available. If somebody criticizes, "Oh, Caitanya Mahāprabhu walked on leg and you are travelling in the jet plane?" Shall I have to take that ideal? These are rascaldom. When you have to work, you have to work with the greatest facility. That's all. Now I have got the facility of the talking in microphone, and... So why should I not take it? It will be recorded. It will be heard by so many others. I am speaking to four, five men. It can be heard by a big crowd of four hundred men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> So we should perpetuate this technical skill of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are not going to... But if somebody's interested doing, so we take it, make the best use of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we do not want money. But they are having money by so many ways. So we take their money and construct a temple. We can sit down here and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. We don't require that temple. But these rascals are accumulating money for wine and women. Take their money, some way or other, and builds a temple. And invite them, "Come and see." Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> This is our policy. We are not constructing big, big buildings and temples for our convenience. For their convenience. This is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> So there should always be programs in the temples for their welfare, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> ...that we live there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But we are taking it, "Now we have got very nice house, room. Let us sleep and eat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Then there'll be wide criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... This is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should remain always <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> within. Outwardly, for others' convenience, you may do something. Similarly, we are accepting this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> We are not <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama;</span> we are above <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> But to give others facility to come to the stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this program must be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, generally in colleges in the West, they charge some fee for going to the college. What is our position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't charge any fee. There is no question of money. Because the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they'll teach free. They require money because they have to give fat salary to these rascals. But we haven't got to. And even we have to feed them, we produce our own grain. So where is the question of taking money? So therefore it is required, somebody must produce food. Then there is no necessity of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> students will produce the food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Should our children who are at <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> when they grow up, should they go to that <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. They should go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We'll start it right away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama</span> college means for grown-up students. College means for grown-up students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Is there a minimum age for beginning such a college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ten to twelve years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They can start at ten to twelve?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. From five to ten years, <span class="Italic">gurukula.</span> And after ten years, they should go to the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> New Vrindaban would be an ideal place in America for such a school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Organize that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I shall go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> This Mahārāja is also going to New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> He can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do that. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, you, and combined together, do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got so many duties to do. Don't waste time, a single moment. And don't eat more and don't sleep more. Then you'll be able to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> And this is the most auspicious work for now, is this remedial measure of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> This is the most auspicious work for now, is this remedial measure to stop the chaos in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> That's most auspicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Most auspicious. Because if the people are in chaos, how they'll be able to accept the great philosophy? It requires cool brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> For example, in my program...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Budhaḥ. Budhaḥ. Eh? Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> My program now is I have ten <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> in buses, and everything and we're distributing books. But if the people are in chaos, how they will be able to accept the knowledge in the books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not all of them are in chaos. There are some of them. Some of them. Not that all of them. Hare Kṛṣṇa [break] ...in separate department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passer-by:</span> Rādhe, Rādhe!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just see. Due to the past training, even an ordinary man, he's chanting, "Rādhe, Rādhe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> When we had our boat, the boatmen every morning were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> ...worshiping...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because, due to past culture, even the lowest class of men, he's also great philosopher than these rascals in western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So all the other programs should be continued, and this program should be added.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Would the...? The persons who would take part in such program, they would have to be devotees in the first place. Is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotees is... I have already explained. We are all devotees. Past condition, we are all devotees. We are not, we do not belong to this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> I have already told you. Suppose I am mopping. So that does not mean I am mopper. But I am teaching how to mop. This is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> So the students, also, they must all be devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Devotees are... That is our life and soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And the idea is that after they've finished their schooling, they would take part in ISKCON, preaching in some way as <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This preaching is also required, to make the groundwork. Because nobody's taking care. Just like some of the devotees, great devotees, they took the profession of becoming thief. They, in South India, it was done so. They took the profession of becoming thief. So a devotee is a thief? But he took. They took it. Because nobody was paying. So they organized a plundering party. "Plunder all these big men." Just like the politicians do. There is history. Yes. So even up to the point to become a thief, devotees took it. Yes. And the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> even up to the point of becoming prostitute-for Kṛṣṇa. So for Kṛṣṇa's sake we have to accept any nonsense type of business. Or on the highest grade. Anything. But for Kṛṣṇa we have to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So, Prabhupāda, in our temples, we have so many devotees. Should the devotees...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should be engaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Should they be trained in a particular...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Those who are not able to preach or to do other things, they must go to the plough department, agriculture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Those who cannot preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Those who are less educated, not very much expert in preaching, they must be acting as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> or as <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Not he's <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Always remember that. But he has to act to fulfill the, fill up the gap. Proxy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So we should encourage people, young people, young students to come to our college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll automatically come if you are ideal. Because they are being forced to poverty. So when there is a question of poverty, they'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Room and board and training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This poverty. Why there is poverty? Because they are not producing food. Everyone wants so-called comfortable life. So-called education. Sitting idle in the table and chair, and talking all gossips, nonsense, and sleeping. They have been trained up in this way, <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So they should be trained to rise early and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, if you keep healthy, then you will naturally rise healthy, er rise early in the morning. But if you... Because you have lost all, what is called? Stamina?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore sleeping is my only business. Sleeping means for the weak. And for the strong, perspiration. This is the sign. When a man sleeps too much, he's weak in his health. And the strong man will perspire. These are very... <span class="Italic">Balera ghāma,</span> and the <span class="Italic">durbalera ghuma. Ghāma</span> and <span class="Italic">ghuma. Ghuma</span> means sleeping, and <span class="Italic">ghāma</span> means perspiration. [break] ...principle. And human beings means trained up under principle. That is the difference between animal. The animals, they cannot take up any training. But the human being, this human form of body is meant for taking training. So if they are not properly trained up, they remain animals and the whole society in chaos and confusion. That's all. [break] ...moment, the human society's so degraded that even we are walking, this is also risky. This is also... Gradually, it is becoming. Just like in our New York... That Berkeley? Berkeley? No. Brooklyn. It is difficult to walk due to the Negroes. They immediately: "Whatever you have got, give me." There are so many incidents. In such city as New York there is always danger like that. If somebody kills you, nobody will take care of you. The human society has become... And in India still, they are not so degraded. You see. Even at night you can safely walk on the street. But in Europe, America, you cannot with confidence walk alone in the big, big streets. So human being has become so degraded. Less than animals. They can attack you. Just like in the forest any ferocious animal can attack you at any minute. The whole big, big cities have become like that. [break] ...example that they have started that United Nations. What they have done actually? United Nations. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have they done anything progressive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? Big, big advertising, "United Nations." All nations, you... Because all the cats and dogs united. What they can do? If the all the world's cats and dogs meet together to make a formula, will they be able? (laughter) So actually, this is the proof. They're all cats and dogs. What do they know how to unite, how to live in peace. They do not know even. Because they're animal, cats and dogs. This is the proof. Just study this institution. What they have done? Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So study this institution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Thirty years now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Thirty years they are struggling for United Nations, big, big expenditure, so many humbug, <span class="Italic">bharam udvahato vimūḍhān,</span> humbug program, and no result. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "I am thinking, I am, only for these rascals. They're making humbug program, but there is no action. And for temporary, so-called happiness, without God consciousness. I am simply thinking of them. Otherwise, personally, I have no problem." This was spoken by Prahlāda Mahārāja to Nṛsiṁhadeva. <span class="Italic">Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB </span>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...business has become like Prahlāda Mahārāja. We can chant anywhere. That's all right. Kṛṣṇa will provide everything. We have no business to do. But we have to take them because we are sympathizer, that so many people are being killed by this modern civilization. They had the opportunity to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, but by the set-up of this rascal civilization, they are being killed spiritually. Therefore we have to take it. [break] ...devotee, personally, he has no problem, but he pushes himself in this degraded society to teach them how to live, how to become gentlemen. Therefore... Otherwise, we have no business. But if we don't give them the opportunity, they'll not be able to come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] ...it will be good for you because Kṛṣṇa will see, "Oh, here is My devotee. He's doing so much for me." Your service will be recognized by Kṛṣṇa. Don't think that because you are teaching a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> how to work like this, you have become a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> You are not <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> any circumstances. Even though you teach to a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> how to work like a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> [break] ...stand. Don't misunderstand. Clearly understand what is the purpose. Is there doubt? Or it is clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> One good example in New Vrindaban, they're actually doing that. They're training <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they're training...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. That was the very beginning...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> <span class="Italic">...vaiśyas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I started the New Vrindaban scheme on this formula.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Kīrtanānanda Swami has carried it out just as you have desired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> So in a sense, New Vrindaban is already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. The starting is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> They even have a court system now. They started it when I was there last time. They have so many members that sometimes someone may commit some offense or something. They even have a judicial type of system where he comes before a board of members, older members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All fights should be decided by the board. That's nice. And it will be accepted even by the court.
