<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> ...plant more trees, orchards for fruits and flowers, flower garden. So there will be plenty of flowers for the altar in Hyderabad every day and for the programs here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...walking road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. This road also, we want to extend it all the way to the end of the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The same road. That's where the dioramas will be. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...having lunch with the cowherd boys on this rocky place and then people can come and sit here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Later on. First of all grow vegetable. Let us eat first of all. Immediately grow vegetables sufficient. And this is good idea, we shall do that, but first of all let us organize the vegetables, fruits. What are these trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> These are <span class="Italic">nimbu</span> [lemon] trees which Badrukas have planted and were neglected. They have become very stunted. We dug them out, and we put some cow dung just last, two, three months back. We're going to bring them up, but they will not be very good now. They've already been stunted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They have been neglected in the beginning, so they have become stunted. So it will help a little by manuring, and some places it has to be grafted and cut off. Some of the trees are good. We get... How many <span class="Italic">nimbus</span> did we get this year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make <span class="Italic">nimbu-ācāra</span> [lemon pickle].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh yes, we made... Acyutagaja isn't here. One devotee here, he knows how to make it. He made very nice <span class="Italic">nimbu-ācāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply salt and lemon juice. Cut some pieces into half and soak it in lemon juice and put sufficient salt. In due course it will be very nice, thick. Very digestible. [break] Not yet utilized. So you have to do that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> ...a trench and a hedge, which has been planted here so that people and animals... Animals is the main problem. They come and they eat up the plants which we grow. So by having this trench we avoid animals from getting in and a hedge also. There'll be a lot of... One big problem that the Badrukas faced was that there was tremendous pilferage. These village people, they live on this land. They used to cut all the wood here for fire, they used to take whatever grows here, maize, and they used to steal in the night everything. Many times...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So ask them to chant and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They will be rectified. Make them friends, family members. Just we organize, everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yesterday this truck came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, I told Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is full of dust, and we have to believe this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, a rascal scientist, "Full of dust."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagad-guru:</span> Their brains are full of dust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have never gone to the moon planet. Simply bluff. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> ...this a reflection of the sun or is it his own light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Own light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> It comes also from the living entities on the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are fire, just like there is fire in the sun, but it is covered with ice. Therefore it is cooling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You mean ice is covering the fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, surrounding, cold atmosphere. Something like... But it is fiery. And how they say that sun reflects some dust? Eh? How people believe it? [break] ...to be given in charge some plot of land to develop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> One problem that could arise by giving them a fixed place, especially giving these labor people, if we give them a fixed place, then tomorrow they may... If they break the principles we may want to remove them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you should change every month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. Because the new phrases by the government is that "Tillers become owners." Whoever tills the land, he becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this society is the society tillers, no individual person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Society means some combination of some men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> These are very fantastic stones here. Especially this one stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who explains how the stone came like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Yes, I think it's wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> They will say from the formation of the mud. Mud accumulated over the years and became stone. Or vice versa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> This one stone is so big. It is just holding on a little stone, it is just in the air, like somebody's underneath and holding it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cow dung can be collected. At least they can be used as cow dung. Here, you should.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> In the small villages the women and children they make the <span class="Italic">paddy</span> for burning in cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> This whole rocky area which we see here used to be like a natural dam, and the land on that side which is now our field used to be a big tank so the soil there is very good. It's like silt. But then, afterwards, somebody had cut through this natural dam and there's a canal that flows through here and goes into that tank over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The canal is in our land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, it passes through our land. Plenty of water, and it goes and flows into that land, into that tank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So but you cannot use that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> That tank is not practical to use, to pump so far. But we can dam this again and make a reservoir and let the excess flow. But they won't let us stop all the water because it will ruin their fields but we can stop a part of the water for our field. We can get a good source reservoir of water over here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tejas is getting breakfast ready, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yeah, he has to cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You can see the canal from here. You can see (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just down there at the base of that rock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Water from the canal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is coming? You can go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I think the ground becomes muddy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Go and check, Jagadānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> It's not very good soil but there is... Right around this rocky area there is this... Research people from the central government, they have brought out a grass called Dinanath, lord of the poor, and they say that you can put this grass in the monsoon time, put the seeds in, just plow it and put the seeds and it's a very sturdy grass. It will grow for the whole year. And the cows can graze there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So this whole area could be with that grass and the cows can graze.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Many temples for <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and around the temple let them live. Yes. All <span class="Italic">viṣṇumūrti,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> How many families should live around...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As many possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Those who are attracted to that particular Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will be attracted. If you follow this program they will be attracted, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Especially people in this area, they are attracted to Bālajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> They call "Govinda, Govinda," always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? They are already devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> They spend their whole year's savings to go to Tirupati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now let them spend here for the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> And live here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will be glad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Then the Tirupati managers will become envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> How shall the worship be in the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the small temples. What shall they worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you introduce <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. And whatever they eat must be offered. That's all.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, every temple is... You can make a main temple there. They'll be remembering Viṣṇu's name always. "Here is Padmanābha temple; here is Mādhava temple; here is Govinda temple," that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> When the cows goes on grazing, they'll go...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> The tree's coming inside our land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No, tree goes in. Other land is here. It goes all the way to that rock over there, Prabhupāda, that rock over there. We are almost at one corner of the land. And the land goes very far to that side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who possesses that land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> This is all our land. This is the village people's land here. And then it goes from behind this tree, it goes all the way to the water. There's a little portion that juts out from here. It goes all the way to the water.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll come to da...? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> We went to the villages there to announce about our program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Hampi. We were in Hampi, Karnataka State, and big rocks like this were there and the people over the years constructed literally hundreds of small temples, some big. Some they cut directly into the rocks and then put in the <span class="Italic">mūrti</span> there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> There is one Nṛsiṁha temple over here which is very unusual. It is inside of... There is a big rock, and it is right inside the rock and if someone wants to have <span class="Italic">darśana,</span> he has to crawl inside to see it.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You show the example. They will see. [break] ...like it, eh? These boys?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Oh, yes, very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you like it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Boy (1):</span> Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You? Young</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Boy (2):</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Not only the small boys. Some of the bigger boys, they also like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is very nice. They'll live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They surveyed this whole hundred acres around here, and they said anywhere in this hundred acres, you'll get water. You can dig and you'll get water. This hundred acres has good underground water supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> And the land is very good, this soil here, this black soil, very good for cotton. It is called black cotton soil.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Not as much as paddy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Not as much as paddy. And sugar cane can grow very well on this also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Immediately grow sugar cane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the upper portion of the sugar cane will be fodder for the cows. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...take great care in what they feed their cows. Even though the grasses may be good they grow alfalfa. They make a special feed for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, they take care because they want to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So the whole taking care is for their own stomach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for cutting the throat, that's all. There is a Bengali word, <span class="Italic">toma ya bhalo asa mussulmanera muragī pusa:(?)</span> "Your love is like tending the roast by the Mohammedans." What is called? Roast? They keep...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "Like a Mohammedan loves his chicken."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So long it is taken very much care, and then, when it is fatty, cut throat. In this material world the love is like that, for one's own interest, not for the lover's interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not love, lust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes, it is lust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there are many of these great trees but the government takes it over. They take dead grass and make liquor out of that. No one is allowed to cut them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> We can get permission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can use for our own purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Can we drink date <span class="Italic">rasa?</span> We are allowed to drink date <span class="Italic">rasa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Date <span class="Italic">rasa?</span> Oh, yes. Why not? Very good.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nīra.(?)</span> This is not date like Māyāpura. This is a different kind of tree. They make toddy out of this.</div>
