<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> No, American boys and girls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> Swami Muktananda. He is very sick in the hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He has a brain hemorrhage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, he is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all right. [break] ...do not come to our temple? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> Well, in the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion</span> you say that they don't chant with an aim to serve the Lord. Rather, they want to become one with Him. So they know that in the temple we are serving Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Besides that, when they come, usually someone calls them a rascal. (laughs) So they don't like to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, don't say. [break] This is the first time I come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Golden Gate Park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Golden Gate. What happened about that house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> We are still trying to negotiate, Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...university. It is almost like, not so big. You were in, anyone? Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, Sorbonne. I've been there, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not so big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> But this is huge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...consider <span class="Italic">nim</span> sacred. [break] ...psychology. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...singing and dancing are great stimulants to self-realization. And he says but he doesn't know why, but he said that perhaps if we study the glands more carefully, we will find out why singing and dancing stimulates identity. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...parvato muākam aprasavat:</span> "Himalaya will give birth children." So many people gathered, "Must be very gigantic." But they saw only rats are coming. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...is from this school, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Where is Yadubara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Right here, Yadubara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Poor Yadubara. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I am one of the rats. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...also? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Viśakha? No. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> ...four years, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and I was full of anxiety all the time. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, more pictures of rats and pigeons than human beings. In the modern textbooks of psychology you find more pictures of rats and pigeons than human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Because they feel that they can study the behavior of rats and pigeons very easily, much more easily than a human being. They can manipulate them. And then they extrapolate from their data on the rats and pigeons as to what human behavior is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, but they say that except man, there is no soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> But now they say that no one has a soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> No, the modern psychological definition is that man is a flesh and blood organism and that you can know man by studying his bodily processes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you give life to the flesh and blood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> That is a problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Oh, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> In California they have passed a law that homosexuality is legal. So the psychologists say that they see the dogs and the hogs and monkeys having homosex relationships, so on that grounds, they say, it should be legal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got homosex? Dogs, hogs, I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yeah, dogs, they say. We were preaching in this one convention that the dogs are also fighting. So therefore fighting and murder should be legal too because the dogs do that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Their argument was because the dogs have homosex, therefore the man should have...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Should have homosex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Yes, if an animal does it, then a human being should have the same right to do it also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Then they can pass stool in the street also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the difference between man and animal? They do not find any difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they find difference in having soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, that is the Christian. But these modern psychologists, they don't even think that the human being has soul. That he's the same as the animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Actually psyche means soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Psyche means mental activities, thinking, feeling, and willing. [break] ...keeping building department different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...their opinion about birth, death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They think that birth is the beginning of the body and that when death comes everything is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why again body comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> What body is that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you take fruits from the tree. Again fruits come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> That is the genes. Before a body dies, it produces some sperm or something and this by-product, and in this by-product there is the life principle, and it is transmitted just like a seed. So the body produces some seeds, and in the genes, in the genetic code, there is a program, and by chance a new being comes into existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This has become a very popular subject, psychology. About 80% of the students take a class in this. And they took a survey, and the reason most students take this class is to find out more about who they are themself. So it is the closest thing in the west to self-realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They've found out that "I am no better than the animal"? That's the conclusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> One school. Then there's another school. They say, "How can you base a theory of human nature on animals?" They do not like this. They are revolting against making man an animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> gives the best psychology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> How to control the mind to uplift the self.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] So why the dogs cannot construct such building? [break] ...psychology? Why they haven't got the same psychology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Well, the scientists would say that "We have the same psychology. We have a material psychology, the dog has a material psychology, but we're just a little more advanced, that's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similarly, there may be others who are still advanced. Therefore the most advanced is God. This should be the psychology. As we see there is difference between dogs and hogs and man, so go on. Search out. So when you find out the most intelligent person, then he is God. [break] <span class="Italic">...parataraṁ nānyat.</span> That is statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> "No more intelligent. Here, ultimate. I am God." So from psychological point of view how they can deny God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> No one is teaching that in this big university. Therefore the students are very discouraged, depressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. Paramaḥ, paramaḥ</span> means the Supreme. Our definition of God is that supreme in every respect. What man can do, the dog cannot do. What the dog can do, the cat cannot do. What the cat can do, the rat cannot do. So we see so many differences. Therefore there must be others who are more intelligent than man. That is demigod. And there must be others most intelligent than the demigods. In this way when you come to the final, that is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Go on finding out more, more, more. When you come to the final, that is God or Kṛṣṇa. So we take instruction from Him. Therefore we are better than the so-called university professors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> In this tower they had to put glass so the students wouldn't jump out. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ohh! Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> In 1963 they had... I think they put these things up, but so many people were committing suicide by jumping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they were committing suicide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Because everyone was very depressed. This is supposed to be enlightenment, a place of knowledge. But everyone was very depressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Being taught that they are the body. I went to a Catholic university and they taught me in psychology, and it was a priest. And they were teaching this, that I am a bodily process. And he never challenged the textbook. So when one thinks he's the body and if he's intelligent, a very depressing thought. Even in the Catholic universities they use these textbooks that teach this materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ: [SB </span>7.5.31] "Blind man is leading other blind men."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul desires to enter the material world, is that an illusory desire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Desire means he wants to enjoy, but he is not enjoyer. When he comes to enjoy, he becomes servant. That is illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> So when the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul descends into the material world, it is like a hallucination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We get experience daily. In the daytime we have forgotten the night dream, and night dream we forget in this daytime existence. So which is correct? Therefore it is hallucination. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...one psychologist who believes man is his body but he talks very much about transcendence. Even the materialists now, they realize that the present condition is very miserable and this false ego is the cause of all problems, so they are seeking some form of transcendence. And many psychologists are talking about transcendence nowadays as the solution to life's problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they define about transcendence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Well, actually they give all the characteristics of transcendence that are found in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> but without saying that man is a spirit soul and without talking about Kṛṣṇa. They believe man should overcome duality, should be beyond attachment, should work for a higher goal in life, things like this, all the characteristics that Kṛṣṇa gives but without Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> It appears that they have taken these things from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they must. What is this department? [break] ...cial science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> How to live in peace. How to live, peaceful society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And fall down from the tower? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> That is part of the study, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's called alienation, why people are alienated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it is very peaceful, fall down and finish. That's all. Suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> The reason they say that people are committing suicide is there is not enough meaning in life, and there's not enough meaning in life because the capitalists are exploiting all the people and making people work very, very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have meaning, life. You have no meaning, but they have meaning. Some section have meaning. They are accusing capitalist. So they have meaning. Why you say there is no meaning? You have no meaning. You have no money-you have no meaning. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> That is their feeling, that if everyone had equal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore you cannot say life has no meaning. You have no meaning, but others may have. You cannot say, generalization, that life has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We can say your life has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are unfortunate. You have no meaning. We have meaning. We are going back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Another reason they feel very depressed is that they feel powerless, that they have no power to control their destiny, that all the big social forces, all the big social powers, they're controlling their lives, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are so much proud of having all the knowledge? Then you admit that you are a rascal. You have no... You are dependent, and you are trying to be independent. That is not being possible, therefore you are rascal. Your education has no meaning because you are dependent and you are trying to be independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Most professors nowadays, they will admit that they have no absolute knowledge, that everything they know is relative and that there might be something much better than what they are teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There might... There is. But you rascal, you do not take it. That is your fault. There is, not "There might be." Here is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">etat jñānam:</span> "This is knowledge, and all other things, they are not knowledge." <span class="Italic">Etat jñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Anything other than this is ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> Your teachings, the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, had not come here before. So these people are misled. So just recently you have presented. So in a sense it is not their fault because they have had not the chance to hear <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. They have got many <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but they were not able to understand. But now by your grace, maybe we'll see the reaction in a few years. Maybe all this will change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they say like that or you are saying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> Well, some people have said. Not widely yet. The work must go on. There's much to go. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Bacteriology, study of germs. So Śrīla Prabhupāda, the reason one person gets a disease from a germ and another person doesn't get a disease, it is <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is infection. If you are weak, you are infected. That is the science. One who is not weak, he does not become infected. Just like in your country there are so many liquor shop, but you are not interested. So it is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> We have a little strength through your divine grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are so many slaughterhouses, but we are not infected. So it is the strength that saves one man from infection. [break] ...learned scholars, they are astonished that I have hypnotized. Otherwise how it is possible? What that Judah's, "charis"...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They say that we're becoming brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Why you cannot do? It is brainwash, yes, all dirty things you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Are being cleansed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> Brainwashed and also heartwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mār...</span> That is our process, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> cleansing the mirror of heart. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is our process, cleansing. <span class="Italic">Tato rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayas [SB </span>1.2.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> In modern psychology, Śrīla Prabhupāda, only until very recently, they did not even want to talk about consciousness. There was no mention of consciousness because it was not a scientific thing that they could observe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientific... It is the most crude thing. Everyone knows. Even the animal, even the ant, they have got consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Well, it embarrassed them that they know everyone has consciousness but there was no way they could measure it or, according to gross science, get some factual information about it. So it embarrassed them so much, they tried to avoid the subject, hush it up, not speak about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their disease. When they cannot make any solution, they avoid it. [break] ...touch the real point, that why there is death. Nobody will touch because they cannot make any solution. Why do they not have a department?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Nowadays they're actually realizing their error and they're studying death more, trying to prepare people for death more. But the only thing they can tell them is, "Accept it." The only thing they can do is say, "You are going to die. So just accept it with a cheerful attitude."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I do not wish to die. Why shall I be cheerful? You rascal, you say, "Become cheerful." (laughter) "Cheerfully, you become hanged." (laughter) The lawyer will say, "Never mind. You have lost the case. Now you cheerfully be hanged." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> That is actually... The whole goal of modern psychology is to make people adjust to the fact that they must stay in this material world and that if you have some desire to leave the material world, they will tell you you are crazy. "No, no. Now you must adjust more again to the material condition."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They teach you to accept the frustrations of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why frustration? You are big, big scientist. You cannot solve?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> They cannot solve because they have the same problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same logic, "Cheerfully be hanged." That's all. As soon as there is some difficult subject, they give up. And they speculate on some nonsense thing. That's all. This is their education. Education means <span class="Italic">atyantika-duḥkha-nivṛtti,</span> the ultimate solution of all unhappiness. That is education, not that after coming to some extent, "No, you can die happily." And what is <span class="Italic">duhkha,</span> unhappiness? That is presented by Kṛṣṇa: <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi duḥkha-doṣānu... [Bg. 13.9].</span> These are your unhappiness. Try to solve it. And that they are carefully avoiding. They cannot stop death, neither birth, nor old age, nor disease. And during the short period of life, birth and death, they are making big, big buildings, and next time he is becoming one rat within the buildings. (laughter) Nature. You cannot avoid the nature's law. As you cannot avoid death, similarly, nature will give you another body. Become a tree in this university. Stand up for five thousand years. You wanted to be naked. Now nobody will object. You stand here naked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They do that also. They have a fad now. It's called streakers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore their punishment is to become tree, to cat, dog, like that. That they cannot explain, why there is cat life, dog life, human life, rich(?) life. That they cannot do. All big questions, they have avoided. And they remain perpetually a rascal. That is their education. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha,</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mūḍha, narādhama:</span> "Lowest of the mankind." Human life was meant for real education. They remain the same rascal and dies very happily. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> In the pictures of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> sometimes yourself and Bhaktisiddhānta has their left hand touching the ground. Is there any meaning to that?</div>
