<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Our sugarcane field is down there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> (a child? cow?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kirtana?</span> (laughter) That's all right. Have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is ours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Where the trees are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Way over the hill and back down there is all ours. In this field we have the calves. And in this field here we have the big cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not now utilized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Not... No. We are just growing hay. Grass for hay. We can sell the hay in the winter for a good price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not possible to walk. [break] ...it is born?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> This one? Last week. His name is... Her name is Lakṣmī. There is more over here. [break] Bull calves. We are getting more bulls than females.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how utilize the bulls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> To plow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plow, transport. You have to engage more men for plowing. Two bulls will be required for each plow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> We can go this way maybe? See the sugarcane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> This is not taking this yet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> We just cut it two days ago, and then it rained. We have to wait for it to dry before you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will not be spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes, if it stays here too long, it will spoil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it rains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We will take it to the garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it will be soil? It will be fertilizer soil? Or no. When it is decomposed? [break] Drinking water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Milk. (laughter) That is meant for calves? Those milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> The barn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Oh, that's the door. It fell off. These are orange trees here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. How long it will take to grow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Well, some down here already have a few oranges, but it will take a few years before they give a lot. They are very sweet kind. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So small still. They are growing. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> ...sugarcane here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...grow very high. [break] ...trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Pine trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You can use those for making the cabins, cottages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...natural arrangement. Jungles-you cut the tree, make your home, and balance you make fuel. And the ground, plow and grow your food. That's all, natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India still, in the villages they do not know, other than this wood fuel, anything else. They are misusing these trees by cutting, manufacturing paper, heaps of paper, in each house throwing daily. They do not read, but they are supplied heaps of paper and cutting these trees. Simply waste. Now wood and paper shortage all over the world. It takes so much time to grow, and one day they cut hundreds of trees like this and put into the paper mill. And heaps of paper is given every house, and he throws away. Then you bring garbage tank. In this way, waste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> There are some beehives down here behind this building. I have twelve, and every year we can get hundreds of pounds of honey. Honey is very nice because it does not spoil, just like ghee. It can keep for many, many months, or a long time. We can go up here to see the cows if you like. Right now they are milking them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if we go, it will be disturbed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Oh, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is one sugarcane each? No. Two, three?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes, at least three. People here in the country, they have lots of land, and they can grow the sugarcane very easily, but they will rather go to the store to buy the sugar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they want to live in the city. That is the... Here if they grow, then they will be engaged here. They cannot go to the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They grow cash crops, make money, and then go spend it in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> The principal livelihood of our neighbors is to grow cows for slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is all over Western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> They don't have to work. They simply put some cows in their field, and when the price is high, they sell them. In this way they live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> What is the attitude of the neighbors to us here? They like us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Pretty friendly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There's a papaya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They grow nicely here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Er, we're trying. I don't know yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Would you like to be fanned, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Just keep the flies away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very friendly to the small calves, this child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes. That's my boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> His name is Vimala.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He chases them all over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. That is the difference between animal and man. A child can control so many calves. Kṛṣṇa was doing that. One stick in the hand of a child can control fifty cows. The child is controller of many cows; a man is controller of many children. In this way, controller, controller, controller, over, over, over... When there is final controller, that is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the definition of Kṛṣṇa: "the final controller."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Here is the cows here. We can see them from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Inside the barn they are milking two at a time. And upstairs we keep all the hay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You keep figures on how much each milk per cow every day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> You hear it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then how the milk will be utilized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> We make sweet rice and <span class="Italic">burfi,</span> we take the cream to make butter and ghee, and all extra milk is made into curd. So it is all used. Thirty gallons a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One gallon means 6 pounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Eight and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight and a half pounds. In Vrindaban they get 1,000 pounds daily, New Vrindaban. What is that cottage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> That what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Cottage there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> That's a little house for the pump, water pump.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This fencing was done before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Before. This farm was once owned by a person who grew race horses for racing and gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Racing is also gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> How much did you pay for it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> The farm? 170,000. This field here is millet. It's a grass for the cows to eat. They give lots of milk because they eat this grass. Very nutritious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not producing for man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any grains for man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> No, we're not growing any grains for man right now. We have fruit trees in the yard. Pears, peaches, plums, figs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some growing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Not very much. They are very young. We just planted them. In a few years we will get lots of fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here the land is mixed with some stones? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> I think they put this here, this gravel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no mango tree here? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> No what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brāhmaṇada:</span> Mango trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> We have some growing at the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vegetables you are growing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes. We have a garden across the street. All these big trees are pecan trees. We have twenty. All this land across the road here that is cleared is ours, all the way up to the trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (reading sign?) "Cow protection and God consciousness. Visitors welcome." That's nice. So, which way we shall go now? Cow protection, they are surprised: "What is this nonsense, cow protection?" Huh? Do they say? "Cow is for eating, and you are protecting?" There are falls?(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Falls?(?) No. This is our small garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fruits and flowers. No, only fruits. What you are doing, flowers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> This is okra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, okra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> And sweet potatoes. And we have eggplants, tomatoes, and peppers here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They give daily some fruits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes. And then we grow potatoes too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, where? Which side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Well, the spring crop was already harvested. We have to plant the fall potatoes in a few weeks. We'll put them over there by the fence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is nice farm. This is squash?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> That's a cantaloupe plant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, cantaloupe. You can grow cantaloupe here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And also watermelon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There is one big watermelon on the vine up there. Perhaps it's ready to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are getting similar land, 600 acres, in Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> We can go this way, here. This is all our machinery here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So already some machine idle. You had to spend so much, but they are lying idle. That is not good. That is the defect of machine. If you cannot ply it, then it is dead loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> If you cannot what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is dead loss if you cannot work with the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But when you go to purchase you have to pay lots of money. Now they will be rusty with water and gradually useless. How much money you have invested?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Thousands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. This is the defect of machine. If you cannot utilize it, then it is dead loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Where are the tractors kept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> One's at the house, and one's in the field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they have to be utilized or rejected, these machines?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes, they all have a purpose. We use them from time to time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But now they are kept open and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Well, we are building a shed to keep them out of the rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the meantime it will be finished. By the time you finish your shed, it is finished. <span class="Italic">Śāstre śāstre dal phariyaga.</span>(?) "Some women were dressing to go to a fair, and when they were dressed, the fair was finished." (laughter) Utilize them. Otherwise, while they are in working order, sell them. Don't keep in that way, neglected way. Either utilize it or sell it at any cost. Otherwise they are useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Srila Prabhupāda? A materialist or someone who wouldn't know, he may say that when the bull is not plowing, all he is doing is eating. You have to pay money to feed him grain or to grow grain to feed the bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will grow, and they will eat. Rather, they will help you for your eating. The father also eats, but he maintains the family. Therefore the bull is considered as father and the cow as mother. Mother gives milk, and the bull grows food grains for man. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu first challenged that Kazi that "What is your religion, that you eat your father and mother?" Both the bulls and the cows are important because the bull will produce food grain and the cow will give supply milk. They should be utilized properly. That is human intelligence. This is filling up with paddy or...? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> With food for the cows. This one has forage or fodder, and that one has grain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everything is for the animals. Nothing for the man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> The cows give us milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all? And you are not growing any food grains? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Er... We've been trying to establish self-sufficient cow protection program first, to grow our own food for the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There is no land available for growing rice or wheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Yes, but the number of devotees we have to do it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But you have so many machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All these machines require oiling and keeping nicely. Otherwise it will spoil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees in distance:</span> All glories to Srila Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. They are starting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are starting back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Down the road we have fifteen acres of sorghum, grain for the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And everything for the cows, but what for the man? They will give everything for cows because they will eat cows, other farmers. But you utilize the animals for growing your food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The idea is we should maintain the animals, but then the animals should provide foodstuffs for the men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And that way there is cooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The animals, bulls, should have helped in spite of that... instead of that machine. Then it is properly utilized. And others, they cannot utilize these animals. Therefore, what they will do? Naturally they will send to slaughterhouse. But we are not going to send to the slaughterhouse. Then what we will do? They must be utilized. Otherwise simply for growing food that the cows and bulls we engage ourself? You are already feeling burden because there are so many bull calves. You were asking me, "What we shall do with so many bulls?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Well, when they grow up we will train them as oxen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what the oxen will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nityānanda:</span> Plow the fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is wanted. Transport, plowing fields. That is wanted. And unless our men are trained up, Kṛṣṇa conscious, they will think, "What is the use of taking care of the plows (cows)? Better go to the city, earn money and eat them." Which one? Huh? That? We shall get on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
