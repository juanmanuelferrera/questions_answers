<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) The experiment with truth (Hindi). What is the experiment with truth? (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have taken that tablet for passing more urine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Daily or..., yes or no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am passing (laughing).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, sir, but you have got the edema on the leg, and I mean, when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is cured. That one tablet, two tablets, has cured. So explain what is the experiment with truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now we must make. I have booked a visit at 7:15.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> At 7:15 I have booked a visit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ha, tell me what is your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is this experiment with truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> About what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything. The world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There are two types of experiments, sir, according to me. I may be wrong and I am open to correction. One experimentation with the crude world; another experiment with your own mind. Which type of experiment we want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, mind we reject immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is not truth. It is accepting, it is rejecting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Man sai eva</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind's business is to accept and reject. Therefore it is not truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Only by mind and concentration of the mind you get the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Concentration is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that is also of what? Of the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The mind, when you concentrate the mind to the truth, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I say. By concentration of the mind you get the truth. That is the right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind is not truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mind is not truth, but by mind we get at the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We can direct our mind towards truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I did not mean mind is truth. All that is made up of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> all that is made up of, I mean, <span class="Italic">mahatsab(?)</span> and down below, are all falsehood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, experiment with truth is not experiment with the mind. So what is that truth, or what is that experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is.... First of all, let us know what is mind by experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Experiment means to examine whether it is truth or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That examines, who examines and what? Who examines the mind, man's mind? After all, no? And examination of anything depends upon the state of the mind, sir, according to the psychology. More concentrated the mind, better it will be nearer the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but, my point is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> See, experiment depends upon all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...if there is truth, where is the scope of experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, that you want to, you want to pick up that point, then you are absolutely right, there is no experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is contradiction. If you say "truth," there is no question of experiment. That I..., try to understand. It is contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> By all these <span class="Italic">jñāni-yogīs,</span> I mean you are a <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogī,</span> but I talk of <span class="Italic">jñāna-yogīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāna-yoga</span> is also truth if you follow. Just like <span class="Italic">jñānāvasthitā tad gatena manasā.</span> So that is truth. But when there is question of experiment, that is not truth. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then they are making experiment in an area which is not already known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that means that that is not truth. So experiment with truth cannot be; this is contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, you are right that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But your how..., ask a question puzzling with me. So I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I ask you, that how this experiment with truth can be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The experiment with sciences, we are making experiment with biological sciences and abstract, I mean sciences of physics and chemistry, and that those who are truths already, we are trying to honor. We cannot make truths. Truths are there already settled by God. God, we try to find out what is exactly, and how it is being done. But we are not trying to find out who is doing. That is your point. I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If the truth is there, there is no question of experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are experimenting to find out the truth. Truth is there. My house is there, sir, but you may go this way or that way, that way. We are making experiment to go to my house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means you do not know what is the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Truth is there, but we do not know the truth. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are making experiment to..., experiment by this way will lead up to the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Experiment means repeat, with regard to the matter of finding out the truth. Not with the truth itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But the word means, "experiment with truth," that is contradiction. There cannot be any experiment with truth. Truth is truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Truth cannot be experimented upon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That I quite agree with you, and I become (indistinct). But so far as the method of finding out truth, that I experiment with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be there, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All our physical sciences...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, ah, I mean, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! ( to passerby) (Hindi ) Are you all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All these sciences, mathematics, chemistry, physics, they have really been advanced by experimentation only. Because we did not know what the truth is behind all these natural phenomena, and we tried to find out the real, how the natural phenomena are, I mean, happening, and that is what the experimentation of the human race was searching out the truth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam. Tattva-jñānārtha-darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But these truths, sir, are approached, I mean actually realized, by various ways. The, I mean the <span class="Italic">jñāna-yogīs</span> or yogis, what you call, they realize it, I mean, because the <span class="Italic">jñānis,</span> they become, by concentration of their mind on the truth, they, that which is highest truth or God. They are after all trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The yogis, they have already found the truth. <span class="Italic">Jñānāvasthitā tad-gatenā manasa pasyanti yaṁ yoginam.</span> So they have already found out the truth, and they are concentrating. That is not experiment. They have already know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But, I don't say they have experimented on the truth, sir. I think I am not making myself more clear to you. What I meant to say is they have experimented by concentration of the mind to find out the truth, and they realize the truth that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Realize, that's a fact. Now they are acting, by.... <span class="Italic">Tad-gatena manasā,</span> mind is fixed up in Supersoul, Paramātmā. That is yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. You mean to say, hm, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have already, nobody (indistinct) truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Brahma-vid brahma eva bhavati,</span> he is just like.... All the knowledge of God is imbibed within.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is concentrated. Just like our <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti</span> means we know, "Here is God: <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span>" So there is no question of experimenting. Now we are known, we are concentrating how to satisfy. There is no question of experimentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the physical scientists' method, chemistry, biology, is, I mean, this physics, they have to experiment in their.... They are nothing but the finding out the truth behind the phenomena, the material phenomena. That is what I mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Phenomena is changeable, always changing. Just like this <span class="Italic">samudra</span>-sometimes here, sometimes there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, right, sir. But why the <span class="Italic">samudra</span> changes? We go into there, into deep depth of that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is truth. That is truth. By the <span class="Italic">yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro,</span> that is truth. <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> That is truth. The phenomena, that is changing. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Are you going tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Tomorrow at what time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. What time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> What time, Harikeśa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually, nobody knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Tomorrow is Christmas day. You are going on twenty-seventh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, twenty-fifth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Somebody said you were going at noon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> I don't think anyone knows yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Why is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Haven't bought the tickets yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No reservations yet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right just to understand? If truth is there, there is no question of experiment. And if experiment is there, that is not truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Perfectly logical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Their experiments are only speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> One wants to experiment, it means they don't know what is truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As soon as there is experiment, there is no truth. And if there is truth, there is no experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> One simply accepts the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Truth, we accept or not accept: truth is truth. Hm? There is a father. That is a truth. You may not know who is your father, that is another thing. But this is a fact, there is father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You have said many times that when mother says "This is your father," you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We cannot go for experimenting other possibilities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no question of experimenting whether he is my father. You take the truth from the mother, and that's final. [break] ...being more and more convinced, why Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhā prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]? Huh? Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is within these groups, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ.</span> That is being more and more confirmed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They may appear like moral men or learned men, but still they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> ...rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, yes. Therefore it begins in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi [SB </span>1.1.1<span class="Italic">].</span> The beginning is truth. <span class="Italic">Satyam paraṁ dhīmahi.</span> There is no question of experiment. It is not this book, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> is an experiment to find out. It is beginning from the truth. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> What is <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sādhana-bhakti</span> is practice. Truth is there, but how to be intimately connected with truth, that is <span class="Italic">sādhana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So sometimes we say to <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> that "Why don't you make an experiment, just try to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, make an experiment, and you will realize it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he does not know; therefore we suggest experiment. He does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So we ask him to perform the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that means, my proposition is that one who does not know, for him experiment. One who knows, there is no experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are asking, requesting to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, but this is not experiment for me, it is experiment for him. He does not know; therefore you are suggesting, "You do like this, and you will understand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-puruṣa:</span> They are conditioned to make experiments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-puruṣa:</span> So they can dovetail that conditioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of experimenting, but he does not know, he is given chance, "All right, try like this." But truth is there. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (to passerby) Oh, the water has gone this way. (Hindi conversation about the tide)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, people can understand that the truth is already there, but they can't understand how by meditating on one particular person or thing, all other truths automatically become realized. They want to experiment to find out what is the unlimited truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them experiment. Because he does not know the truth perfectly well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> So just by meditating on the person Kṛṣṇa, all other truths become known?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Prabhupāda doesn't say that no one can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are some animals, they do not actually touch the egg-birds. Or the, I think, what is called, tortoise. They simply concentrate, and the egg comes into being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> If you hear the truth, there is no need to make an experiment at all. Isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That is perfect experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> That is, that happens with full <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span> When there is unflinching faith, he will not go for making the experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> [break] ...come and dance at <span class="Italic">āratik</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> If they want to swing their arms, why not come to <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and dance? (talking about people exercising on beach) In 1966, Prabhupāda, we went up to Dr. Mishra's <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> upstate. And there was some yogi from the New York Institute there, and he said that automatically, just see these devotees, automatically they are doing everything that we are teaching, just by this one process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the statement by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Viha hoite sarva siddhe hoi betaman.</span> By practicing this chanting, you'll get all perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> One morning we were out walking in a sunrise, and Hayagrīva pointed out, "Oh, there's a very beautiful sunrise," and you said, "The sunrise is not very wonderful, but He who has made it is wonderful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is, they glorify the scientists, another scientist, but they are so fool they do not glorify who has made that brain. You cannot make that brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> [break] ...I told him it might be that (indistinct) they have not done all these things, go to Kṛṣṇa temple, coming back, nine thirty, ten o'clock. Then take all this train...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's favor. Yes. Kṛṣṇa is favoring to finish this job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Now we know that <span class="Italic">janma</span> is.... I told him they may not be having many other <span class="Italic">janma,</span> that may be why they are suffering like this now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no suffering. Their material existence is being reduced on account of serving Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> One lady is there in Bombay, whole family, old lady, young children die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ [SB </span>10.88.8]. This is special favour of Kṛṣṇa because they, by this pious activity, they wanted this material enjoyment, which you are complaining, that they are reducing material enjoyment. But that is Kṛṣṇa's favor. He doesn't want reduction of material enjoyment; at the same time, they want to worship Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is seeing that these fools, they want Me, and at the same time material enjoyment. So "Finish their material enjoyment; they will simply think of Me."</div>
<div class="Verse">bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tayāpahṛta-cetasāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>samādhau na vidhīyate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.44]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">So long one will be too much absorbed in this material enjoyment, he cannot be perfectly devotee. Therefore sometimes Kṛṣṇa, when He sees "Someone is serious to get Me," and at the same time he wants material enjoyment, so indirectly or directly He finishes that material enjoyment. That is a special favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> (referring to passerby) The dogs are taking the lady for a walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> The man's body is made up of <span class="Italic">kapha, piṭha, vāyu,</span> and woman's body also has the same ingredients.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So then what is basic difference between human body, I mean man's body and woman's body, which attracts each other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because if you want to be attracted, God has made in such a way that both of them are attractive to one another. That's all. You want to be attracted; therefore woman is made attractive. And the woman wants to be attracted; man is attractive. This is nature's arrangement so that you may be bound up by this attraction. <span class="Italic">Tayor miṭha hṛdaya-granthiḥ mām.</span> You are already bound up, and by this attraction you will be more tightly bound up. <span class="Italic">Puṁsāṁ striyā mithuni-bhāvam etad.</span> The whole material attraction means a man's attraction for woman and a woman's attraction for man. But when they are seeking, "Where is woman, where is woman, where is woman," and the woman is seeking, they come here to make this business. Huh? And when they are actually attracted or united, then this bondage, material bondage, will become more tight. Therefore the Vedic civilization is how to slacken it, and ultimately, by force, separation, <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Because unless they are separated, there cannot be any spiritual advancement. That is the whole process. The unity is bondage. I have written a letter that man is good, woman is good, and when they are united, they are bad! (laughs) Both of them are bad. And the material world is taking, "This is the best thing." But actually that is not the thing. Man is good, because he is part and parcel of God, and woman is good, part and parcel of God, but when they unite, they become bad. <span class="Italic">Tayor miṭhādi hrdayanti-maho.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> For detachment you suggest they remain separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless they are separated, it is very difficult to advance in spiritual consciousness. That is the whole Vedic system. Gradual. First of all, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> he is educated very nicely that this is not good to marry and enter into a family life. And in spite of education, if he is still inclined, then he is allowed to marry. This is a concession. And that is for a few days, few years. Then compulsory separation from the family life. <span class="Italic">Vanaprāstha.</span> At that time, wife is allowed to stay with the husband, but finally they are separated, <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Wife should go home, remain with their children. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So when they are <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> they make advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? That advancement is not very solid. But there is advancement; but that is not very solid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> Without sex pleasure a man and a woman would not be attracted to one another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Attraction means that sex. There is no other. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi gṛhamedī sukhaṁ hi tuccham.</span> Why they are working so hard day and night? Only for that sex pleasure. That is the psychology. There is no other happiness. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi gṛhamedhī sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Their happiness is based on the center of sex pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> So the body of a woman only reminds of the sex pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Body of man or woman. The same thing. This is the only pleasure. In this material world, so-called pleasure means sex pleasure. Why they are working so hard day and night? Only for that sex pleasure. That is the center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They say, "We want to come together to serve the Lord." Is that excuse or is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Together they go to hell. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in your society, if sometimes householder devotee, they do very big, big job, I mean they are advanced then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has done that big job? Hm? You have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, we see all the GBC, and they are doing very nicely, like Saurabha dāsa and Mūrti dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> Saurabha is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> His wife doesn't live with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> The same principle is there for everyone, in so far as one becomes detached, then he's <span class="Italic">sannyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Detachment required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It is not a matter of cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Sa sannyāsī. Anāsaktasya viṣayān.</span> He has no attachment for this eating, sleeping, mating. He is attached to Kṛṣṇa. And that is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Sannyāsī</span> does not means dress. Detached. <span class="Italic">Sat sannyāsī. Sat, oṁ tat sat,</span> the supreme, and for Him everything, risk all. That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa. Anāsaktya...</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ, kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ sa sannyāsī...</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>6.1]. One who does not take the reward of his labor, he is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Anāśritaḥ karam-phalaṁ.</span> Everyone works for some profit, and one who does not take the profit, works for Kṛṣṇa, he is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ, kāryam. Kāryam</span> means it is my duty to work for Kṛṣṇa. In this way one works, he is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca na niraghir na cākriyaḥ.</span> He is yogi also. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (to passerby) Just like Arjuna. He is fighting not for himself; for himself he declined to fight. But when he understood that Kṛṣṇa wants, "All right, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span> I shall fight. I shall kill my grandfather and everyone." This is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> it is said that if a devotee is sincerely serving the Lord, and Kṛṣṇa takes away his material opulence, and still if he's sincerely serving the Lord, the Lord becomes his intimate servant, He says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intimate servant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. In one purport in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there, "servant," this word is used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Becomes his friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. [break] ...stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> Fifth Canto, that there are <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> they are not attached to <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> They actually, they are attached to Kṛṣṇa, but maybe for convenience sake he remains a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha. Gṛhastha,</span> there are two words: <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī.</span> One who is <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī,</span> he is hopeless. One who is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> that is all right. (end)</div>
