<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing that came up when we were into doing the political thing a little bit, they were asking..., one of the major issues always in political battles is how would you control inflation, how would you solve the inflation problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inflation problem, I suggested, make gold coins as medium of exchange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means that there'll be the same..., it'll have the same value all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No question of value. Money has to be paid by real money-gold, silver. No paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But whether it's gold or paper, isn't it all just representative of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, medium of exchange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I have to pay you, if you don't accept paper, then I'll have to give you gold or silver, and international exchange is going on. Then there is no inflation, because you'll not accept paper, so what is the use of printing notes? They are printing notes without any gold reserve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nothing. It's just imaginary wealth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Bank will give you loan, they are eager to give you loan, and you haven't got to pay anything in gold and silver. One check, that's all. And with that check you can purchase lots of commodities and hoard it, and price will be increased. If I have to pay gold for (indistinct), then I have limited source. The price will not increase. This is the only way. Introduce gold only, gold and silver. In the British period in our childhood there was practically no notes. Silver. If I have to take payment from you, one thousand rupees, you will give me so much silver. For counting, counting, I have to see whether it is.... There were some imitation, counterfeit. So each coin you have to see, they were saying like that, that, "For thousand rupees I have to occupy so much space."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And weighed so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and weight was so much. (pause) The time was not so bad. If you take some cash, thousand, two thousand rupees with you, you can safely walk on the street. Now if somebody knows that he has got thousand rupees cash with him, maybe he will be killed. The bank, they are so much afraid, they keep police in bank, police guard, always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have so much security systems and TV cameras. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is there any kind of a pain killer or anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nothing we can get from India or anything like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, don't worry. It will be.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had no reason to object to something, but they just do it out of their nasty nature. Anyway, so I had the forms filled out, everything. Then we went to a lawyer, we got it notarized, everything in order. And the man this morning said he would give us the passport the same day. Then this other man, higher up, bigger dog, I went to see him, and he said, "No, no, it will take four days." So I said "Why not do it in three days? We can get it Monday." We were very nice, myself and Mr. Battra, Subhavilas went. He's also Punjabi. They were speaking Punjabi. He was, Mr. Battra was even begging him, unnecessary things. And then finally he said "Come back Monday morning," after sitting there for two hours, for no reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> With no yes or no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But no today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda needs a new passport with all the pages filled out. I wanted to get it in Fiji, but the embassy was on the other side of the island. So we'll try again Monday morning. I told him though that we've given our lives to preach the <span class="Italic">dharma</span> of <span class="Italic">Bhārata-varṣa,</span> and sometimes we become-I told him in a nice way, not in an angry way-sometimes we become very disenchanted and disenheartened when we see that Indians like yourself, they present unnecessary obstacles to our preaching mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sufficient insult. (laughter) That enraged him. You said Indian-givers. That offended him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that was after he said no. Then he changed his mind a little bit, but I don't know. He said come back Monday morning then. I was thinking maybe he wanted to be bribed or something. Maybe Mr. Battra knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian government is nasty, there is no doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Unnecessarily. He said "I have to fill out four pages." Four pages of the passport, that takes four days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone in government service, at least it is to be supposed they are all nasty men. Here also, why not? The other day the custom officer, unnecessary. Unnecessarily. He is opening the snuff box, this box, that box. Unnecessarily. Not a gentleman. It is stated there, "snuff," and he is bringing knife to open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Harassment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. <span class="Italic">Rājanyaiḥ, dasyu-dharma.</span> Simply wanting some bribe. They are in power. And that will increase. It will be impossible to deal with. Now it is already. In India, any work you want to be done by government, unless you bribe.... In Africa also. The situation is becoming very dangerous. That Mullik's Thakur, where he...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Calcutta, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The state is in the management of official trustee. And this trustee in charge of the trust board men, they give us so much trouble and exploit the position for his personal profit. I have seen. Horrible. For instance, I can give you, if in some property there is some repair, it will cost you, say, one hundred rupees. And they'll give it to a contractor, and the contractor will present a bill, twelve hundred rupees. And he'll pass. And the contractor will be given, say, two hundred rupees, and balance he'll take. I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stealing from the trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way he's.... The money's in his hand. If you want money for expenditure, so if I press you, you have need of money, so you do everything, give some back, get the money. You are in urgent need. Everywhere. All, whole world they have become dishonest. Even the high-court judges, magistrate, they are getting bribe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's an extremely difficult situation</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Extremely. They've lost their religious sentiment, religious consciousness. They're just like rude, crude. There was one chief minister in Punjab, he got a big business, big man, "Mr. such and such, I'm sending such and such man. Give him ten thousand rupees without waiting for his reply." "So what for?" "Why you are asking? Give him ten thousand rupees." And the man goes, and he has to pay; otherwise he knows that "This minister will harass me in so many ways later on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are called public servants, the so-called government officials.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even your country, there are so many bogus institutes. There was one Mr. Bogart. I used to call him Bogus. Bogart is a title?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His business is he has got some institute in the United Nations building, and he has got some office also. That means some poor country, poor, "Give me, give me charity," propaganda. And he will officially present some application to the Ford Foundation, and the trustees will give him money. There is no poverty-stricken application, but through this institution.... And there is clique, between the.... They are always.... That trustee came, that Desai?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In South Africa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Durban? Yes. They were taking money. Somebody told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> His grandfather left two hundred thousand dollars to be given to charity in his last will and testament, and they're scheming how to keep the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Is it because they are killing the cows that this is happening, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things. In India there is no.... At least gentlemen, they do not eat meat. But the thing is that when there is fire, so everyone will suffer. If there is fire in this building, either you are sinful or not sinful, the effects will be shared by you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (showing Prabhupāda newspaper) There was one newspaper at the Indian Embassy printed in Canada, it's called <span class="Italic">The Indian Calling.</span> On the back page they have one supplement they took from <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is ours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. This is printed by the Indian community, one man, Anand Singh, and he included part of an article from the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine. There's one article in here also, the front page is a whole.... There's a racket they had going, these people, this man. He went to India and he found one widow, and he said, "I am a personal friend of the Prime Minister of Canada. Give me money, I'll take you to Canada. You can come. I'll make sure you get immigration status." So she came with him to Canada, and then he started blackmailing her, "Give me this much money every day, otherwise I'll reveal that you're an illegal immigrant, and you'll be in trouble with the government." And eventually it became such a burden that he simply killed her, cut her into three pieces and killed her. Then they found parts of different bodies like this, and they finally found the man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The woman was killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, this happened in Toronto. Wretched world. (long pause) [break] He writes what appears to be a nice editorial, "Weak Western Educational System"-it's on the second page-in which he brings out how the Indians have taken the worst from the West, namely it's educational system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is my version?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but I think he has gotten this from you, the idea of Vedic education. You're the only person preaching this in the world, practically. He's certainly read some of your books, Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> He said, "We heard that your spiritual master's coming to town. We'd like to put part of one of the articles from BTG in our paper." Did he put in any advertisement? Oh, I'm surprised. He said, "I'd also like to put an advertisement in the paper." Then he asked, he said he wanted to charge us money for the advertisement. So I told him, I said, "You're from India. You should want to do this for free." He wouldn't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They use part of your article to advertise Indian culture. This "Could Plato have gotten his ideas from ancient Indian Vedas?" And at the same time they won't even give a free advertisement when you, the speaker of the article, is here in person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you have refused to pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, I refused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> I said "If you want to do it for free, then we'll be happy to put it in." I said, "We are spending two hundred dollars every Sunday to give <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> to these people. Why do you want to charge us so that we can advertise for them to come?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this newspaper wants to see me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> He's..., they are coming Śrīla Prabhupāda, at six-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This newspaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Oh, not this one, no. The <span class="Italic">Toronto Star.</span> It's the main paper in Canada, and they'll be here at six-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a big, big advertisement here for Swami Vishnu Devananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He's a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From the Shivananda Yoga Vedanta Center. (laughs) He's going to lecture on the five basic aspects of yoga. Admission three dollars. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> We're getting quite a few calls. Within the last two months four Indian people have come to me requesting that they can get married in the temple. I told them not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not marriage company. We get married our students if there is necessity, but we don't.... Marriage means they will arrange their marriage in our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> They arrange the marriage on their own; they have the ceremony here. And they pay some fee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They don't even know..., they don't even know that the Deity is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similar proposal was there in Montreal. Then it will become a business. They are not devotees. They have no good place to perform the marriage, they come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The rest of the year they don't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got a separate place for allowing them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, we have this other room adjacent to the temple room, which is very large.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that can be used by them. Not the big hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Not the temple room, but use this other one. The idea being that they will start to relate to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Most of the time they're reluctant to come, but if they think there is some facility, then they'll come anyway, for that. Then they can see the Deities. And they will pay for catering. We will serve them <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> and they will give the money for the <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> In that way they can get <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> from the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> we shall arrange. And they will pay for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, just like the Christians. They have that kind of thing when they have a banquet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> The type of ceremonies, they want some sort of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Havana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> What's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Havana,</span> fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, they want fire sacrifice. Can we give them some other ceremony to satisfy them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other ceremony? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Well, sometimes the Indians come with their children, and they want us to bless the children, so we give them <span class="Italic">caraṇāmṛta</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> ...and hold the child and then they give some <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā,</span> five dollars or ten dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that we can do. That is first-class.(?) Give <span class="Italic">caraṇāmṛta</span> and they have given some donation, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> We can give them a lecture on householder life? Have them sit and give them a lecture and then give them <span class="Italic">caraṇāmṛta</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will hear your lecture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> The, all the people that come for this ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can hold <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> That will be nice, if they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They want the fire. They want the fire. They want to have a priest to build, to make a fire ceremony for their wedding. Many Indians ask this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So on the whole, what they are going to pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> About five hundred dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Five hundred dollars!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Oh, yes. I mean, I had some Indian men that gave three hundred dollars worth of <span class="Italic">bhoga</span> just for your coming. Four men came with seventy pounds of butter, fifty pounds of sugar, so many preparation, ah, <span class="Italic">bhoga</span> for offering. So I think they'll pay five hundred dollars. That's for catering. We give the <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> we give the hall for the evening. They can come, and the devotees will be there. We distribute <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> to them, have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If <span class="Italic">kīrtana, prasāda</span> distribution is there, you can allow. That is our main program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> But they won't pay that much. They have to pay at least a thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Then give them <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> and if they chant, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They'll pay that easily for a wedding. It's a big thing for Indians. Even in the West people....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they do, but <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> will be distributed by us, and they must chant for half an hour. (laughter) Then we accept. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> How should I satisfy them for the desire for a fire, as Jagadīśa was saying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can have their own fire. What is that? They'll chant some Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> that's all right. But they must chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We can allow them to have a fire here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the wrong? If it is Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> then there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, then they will feel that the temple is like a place where they can come, even though if it's only for once a year. They will still give the <span class="Italic">lakṣmī,</span> a donation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will consider it is their own interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> 'Cause all the Christians have their churches, and we are the only church for them. The other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Then you can (can't(?)) allow it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> There are four temples in Toronto of other Indian groups. But they are political and social. The people really don't like them. And they don't have Deities like we have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a farce. That is not temple. In London also there are Hindu Center, this, that. All nonsense. Now they are installing Deity. But it is not taken care of properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> They invited me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to visit one of their Sunday services, and I went, and they had a fire, an installation of the Deities. They had one <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and they had a small Deity of Viṣṇu, and he had the fire sacrifice in four minutes, and then they installed the Deity on the altar. That was it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They, what do they know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The press reporter's here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...accept London. Haṁsadūta, when he was GBC.... He's still GBC?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Haṁsadūta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That part? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, Jayatīrtha is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there was some complaint against him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Against Mādhavānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. The complaint is that he spent money on his own account lavishly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Hmm. I don't know about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of the life members complained. I received several complaints. The other day I asked, "You collected some money for constructing temple, so where is that money?" So he gave explanation. So thirty, fifty thousand pounds were collected by him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> From Ambarīṣa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, this was in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, in England, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is only balance two thousand five hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, just two or three thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the money, he said, spent. Now they are asking for loan for purchasing one house. This money was collected for temple construction.... We were awaiting opportunity. In the meantime, money spent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Have there been any complaints from Detroit? Have there been any similar complaints from Detroit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Detroit I have received complaint, that.... Many.... Govardhana was popular president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Popular. Everyone liked him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, very gentle soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So this is complaint I received.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They don't like Mādhavānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's forceful. He's quite a forceful person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this forceful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, if someone is very active, then it's only natural that some people will not be very keen on him, because he likes to get things done. Those that are a little slow, sometimes they complain. Maybe just that he's only been there a month or so. He's only been there not too long, so it's natural that it will take some time for the devotees to adapt to doing the things according to his direction rather than the way that they've been used to doing it. There's always some transition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can know more about him from Haṁsadūta. As well Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Bhagavān recommended him. He had been in Paris before coming to America. But his complaint was that he didn't speak French, so he didn't like to stay in France. Then he came to America, and he was distributing books with Tripurāri Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he is very intelligent, there is no doubt, intelligent, and for preaching work he is good. But for becoming the manager in London, there were.... What is that boy in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, Prabhaviṣṇu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prabhaviṣṇu. So, who would become the president, there was war. (laughter) Haṁsadūta wanted Prabhaviṣṇu, and Mādhavānanda wanted that he would become president. In this way, there was great faction. So the management was being done nicely. He was attracting Indians, faithful, they were following. But there were several complaints that he spent very lavishly on his personal account. Purchasing (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> What do you think we should do, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? No, I do not wish to interfere. You manage now. I want to see that you are managing without my interference. Now practically I want to concentrate more, or absolutely I want to do that. But sometimes this mismanagement gives me too much anxiety. I do not wish to see that somehow or other we have built up a nice institution, on account of lack of management it may be hampered. That is my only anxiety. Now what is the position of the Gurukula in Texas? Our Gurukula, I have repeatedly said that we want simply to know English nicely-English is international language-and Sanskrit just to read and understand our literature. But we don't find any progress in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you say that we don't find any progress, do you mean just on account of Pradyumna's testimony? Or do you see beyond that, also, that there's no progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Pradyumna, of course, personally saw. But when I was in Dallas I could not find any good progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> How do you judge that progress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By the chanting of the Sanskrit verses. Not all of them could do it very nicely. It is only practice, and.... Apart from Pradyumna. So his complaint is that he cannot write even 1, 2, 3, 4, up to ten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I know we have some good people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We have some good, qualified people, and I'm organizing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw some machine purchased, some, for publishing some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Printing machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Printing. Why this is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Those were purchased before I got involved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means money was spent unnecessarily, without any tangible result. Now Dayānanda left. He was there.... Without any consideration, he left. So what to do with all these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I think I have it under control. I have plans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see these two things especially, that they.... English is their mother tongue, mother language. They can easily become English scholar very easily. And Sanskrit language is no difficulty. Read and write, read and write, then he will learn. Our education in Sanskrit was in college. Of course, I was the best student in my class of Sanskrit. I was standing first. But we are not like the so-called Sanskrit scholars. But for our purpose we can read and write, that's all. Similarly, we don't want any very learned scholars, Sanskrit grammarian to manufacture jugglery of words, meanings. No, we don't want that. Simply we can conduct our business, that's all. Just like Marwaris, they, their education is up to their business understanding, that's all. They don't want to be scholars or technologists. You won't find in big, big Marwari family they have become a doctor, engineer or technologist, no. But in business dealings they are first class. (laughs) That they train. I had one Marwari friend in Calcutta. He was a very rich businessman and has got several (indistinct). So sometimes I went to his house. I saw that he had engaged a Sanskrit <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> and an English teacher. That's all. So I asked him, "You don't send your children to school?" "No, no, no, no. I..." If we require some technologist, we can purchase. You pay some money; so many technologists you will get, M.A., Ph.D., D.H.C., C.H.C. All right, take payment and do business (indistinct). They employ very, very, very large salary. But on the head, management, their own sons, grandsons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> You've explained this to me a number of times, and I think I'm beginning to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Knowledge is spiritual knowledge. <span class="Italic">Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam.</span> Now, of course, social conditions have changed. There are so many factories, and they require technical knowledge. But we are not going to the factories. That is sure and certain. Neither we are going to start any factory. That is not our business. Our factory at most, <span class="Italic">cut cut, hut hut,</span> that's all. We don't want to start factory or Ford factory and make a hell out of life, the hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I used to work in a steel works. It's worse than hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is more than hell. There is no life. I have been in Tata steel iron factory. I saw it is a hell. One melting pot just like a skyscraper building. You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I used to work on them, same thing. I was working where they pour the metal into ingots, into casings, and then when it solidifies they take a chunk of iron out, it's still white hot, and then they put it in ovens. And then after a while, when they need them, they take them out with big cranes and they put them on a series of rollers, and then it goes through a mill, what they call a mill. It's like a big mangling machine, and it crushes the steel ingot into plates, big plates. Then it goes along and it's cut and sent out. It cools down on big banks and it's sent out. So my job was, I was doing maintenance fitting on all those machines. On the rollers and on the cranes and on the big mills, like that. It was terrible. We used to work from two o'clock in the afternoon until ten o'clock at night, one shift, then from ten until six, and then from six until two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight hours. Without any recreation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, one break, for lunch. It was just indescribable. There's so much heat and fumes, and always covered in oil and grease, crawling around on your hands and knees to fix some machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> All for the advantage of some wealthy man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And after this hard labor, his only recreation is wine. Did you drink?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) Yes, we used to go straight from the steel works to the pub, public house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I also worked in a factory for a while. Same thing. And people were always getting hurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not meant for that. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I thought you joined from college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, but during the summer I had a job in a factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, to get some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This girl Elizabeth paid so much money; it is due to Govardhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Due to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Govardhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, Ambarīṣa also. Ambarīṣa also has given money due to Govardhana. He's a very gentle soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His background is good service. Therefore I'm asking why he should be changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if he's not very fixed up, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> One thing, if I had not been tied up in Dallas with Gurukula, I could have spent more time in Detroit, and I think that would have helped the situation. Because he was alone, working alone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now one thing is, that he has given service for the benefit of the society. Very tangible service. He can be in charge of book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Mādhavānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that would be good, if they were co-managers or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Govardhana president?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? You should recognize his service. He induced persons to do some.... That you cannot neglect. [break] Paper men coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, Jayādvaita's going to talk to them a little first, give them <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> just explain the basics of the movement so that they, you know, they may be a little favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they'll understand</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Otherwise, if they just come and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult to understand that our movement is spiritual movement, and they do not understand what is spiritual, the whole world. That is the defect. But still we are going on. That is Kṛṣṇa's grace. Otherwise, nobody understands what is the aim or what is the platform. (Some kids yell "Hare Kṛṣṇa" in disrespectful tones outside the room. Prabhupāda and devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's amazing when you think how we're expanding all the time. It's really amazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Kṛṣṇa's grace. Therefore they take us as one of these Guruji and Babaji, like this, like that. But when they read our books, higher class, they understand the seriousness of it. They admit that this is India's original, traditional knowledge. Higher, higher circle, they don't want any imitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, someone with a little intelligence, he's not befooled by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. During British period, high British officers, big, big managers, they liked Indians with original culture. They did not like any Indian with European imitation-pants, coats. They didn't like these imitations. My Godbrother, that German, Sadānanda.... You have heard his name or you have seen him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he came to India, he was my intimate friend. So he was telling me that "In our country, when some Indian student comes, especially while returning home after their education, they stop for some time in Germany, we used to inquire from him how much he is aware of his Indian original culture." Because they have got very good respect. All over the world they have got. Even Russia. They have got good respect for Indian culture. They have liked our books only on account of the..., because the Sanskrit verses are there. They took it, "Oh, it is original." Scholarly people like our book on that account, because we explain original Sanskrit verse. That they have got very good regard, that there is knowledge. They're impressed. And Britishers made propaganda only that India had no culture, almost uncivilized: They push women forcibly in the fire after the death of her husband, and in the temple, the priests, they make all nonsense with women, and so on. This was their.... Just to prove that "India was uncivilized, and we are making them civilized. By our compassion for the uncivilized persons, we are occupying."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They used to call that the "white man's burden."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. So these English people, they were very expert in making propaganda. They killed Hitler by propaganda. I don't think Hitler was so bad man. What do you think? You are Englishman. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's getting.... (laughs) Just from hearing you speak in the last few months I can understand that the whole history that I was ever presented in school is completely warped around to the way that the English saw it, especially the last two centuries, when the British empire was on the move. It's completely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But actually, the war was between Germany and England. Others joined, some interest or something. Actually, the war was to be fought between England and Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's one devotee who joined in Toronto, Frenchman, and he was in France at the time of the war. He's an older man. And he told me also.... His father was French, but he was sympathetic to the Nazis, and that it was actually Maxmillian or one of the Frenchmen who sided with the British, but the majority of the French people didn't mind the German occupation. It was due to one of the political factions siding with the British that there was a French underground and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> France, they are always enemy of Englishmen. There is is old history-Hundred Years' War, Seven Years' War. Napoleon also wanted to cut down the Britishers. France is dead enemy of England, and there is always competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even just with De Gaulle also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> France is not friendly to India, uh, England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> England has always been inimical with the rest of Europe. With Germany, France, Spain, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they thought, "This is a third-class nation, a small island, fishermen, and they have wealthy (indistinct)?" That is natural. Whole world. In our childhood, we used to see map, almost whole world red-red means British. (laughter) They said that there was no sunset in the British Empire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> This Frenchman also says that he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> German people still hate England. They do not like to speak in English; that I have seen. In the bank they know English, but they won't speak it. English everyone knows. The Kaiser was against. They said that Kaiser is the grandson of Queen Victoria, from daughter's side. And King George from the son's side-Edward's seventh son. They were cousin brothers. So this Kaiser, when he was young boy, went to paternal uncle's house, when he was a young boy. So there was some playing, cut with a knife. So royal family, so many doctors came. So the boy was saying, "Why you are trying to cure it? Let the English blood go away." So from the childhood he was so inimical, that "I have got some English blood in my body, my mother is English, father German, so let the English blood go away." I do not know if that is fact, I heard it. (laughs) Maybe. It is joking also and serious. In our childhood in school, a book was there, "England's Work in India." One Mr. M. Ghosh, he wrote this book just to flatter the Englishmen. This, that "white man's burden." And it was the impression in those days: just to become like Englishmen, that is civilization. The Parsees in Bombay, they were the first-class flatterer, imitation, how to become like English lords, barons. This Tata factory was started by such ambition. They wanted to be English baron, lord, industrialist. In Calcutta also. Where our temple is, that is called <span class="Italic">saheb</span> quarter. In our childhood we used to say <span class="Italic">saheb</span> quarter. <span class="Italic">Saheb</span> quarter means European neighborhood. They say our temple is <span class="Italic">saheb mandira</span> in Māyāpura. And in Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">aṇgrejī mandira.</span> The same impression. To become <span class="Italic">saheb,</span> that was great prestigious. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They actually had no resources whatsoever, the British. They had no resources whatsoever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was the mission of Hitler, that "These people are shopkeepers' nation, fisherman's nation. How they have become so big? This must be finished." Because their business was being hampered by the Britishers. In India we have seen. German and Japan, very cheap and first-class goods they will supply. The Britishers would not allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, at that time, anything that was made in England automatically was considered first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, any rascal thing. They made a good market. And British Empire means to sell their goods. And they, for that purpose, they became rich. Money was drawn from all parts, especially from India. Everything. Later on, gradually we came to understand. In Lucknow, because I was in medical business, so I saw one Japanese salesman was selling one medicine, one or two items, potassiodide. Do you know? No. Potassium iodide. And another, iodine. He was selling at four rupees, eight annas a pound. But we were accustomed to purchase English potassiodide and iodine, thirteen rupees a pound. That Howard's.... Very famous, Howard's chemicals, like that. They were selling. So I doubted that "How so much cheap this Japanese firm can supply?" And they used to advertise that all these Japanese goods are third class. Yes, "German goods are second class. Our goods, first class." So I inquired from the salesman, "How is it that you are supplying so cheap?" "They're supplying.... The price is the real price." "Now why they charge more?" "They purchase from us and pack and sell." There are many big chemical concerns in Germany. Germans are very good manufacturers, especially of chemicals, iron, machine. Still you find, all this Uher and, what is called, Gundsag?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Grundig.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're all German. All first-class machine you'll find. This Mercedes motorcar, they're all German. They don't manufacture third-class thing. Everything they manufacture first class. Still, the Germans suffered so much, but when I was in Germany I saw they are very prosperous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now we have to get them interested in your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Germans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't think we have any reviews from any big German scholars yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if they have ordered for their textbook, that order will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> East Germany, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their order itself will be a testimony. If they order in their own form, "Supply this." Max Mueller was German. So long we are in this material world, this competition, animosity.... Even in the higher planetary system, there is no peaceful condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> You feeling headache?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is some pain. My teeth are now useless. So it is all rotten now. Sometimes it becomes acute. There is no strength in the teeth. Some of them, fifty percent, have already fallen. Therefore I cannot eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I think that a very nutritious diet can be made just from liquids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Liquids, yes. Milk is the best food. Children, when there is no teeth, milk is the food. In Western country also, I think old men, they take milk and puffed rice. Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, soft foods anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, especially in Bengal, there is a preparation, it is softer than the puffed rice-<span class="Italic">khoi,</span> fused rice. That is very good. Light, at the same time soft purgative. That milk mixed with is a very good food for old men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In that newspaper article in the <span class="Italic">Butler Eagle,</span> that very first article when you just arrived that we saw? They showed that copy in Los Angeles. It mentioned, the reporter there, he quoted you as saying that-you were telling him about milk, how good it was-and he quoted you as saying that milk is the miracle food for babies and old men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's a fact. No, it may be there are so many other foods, but cent percent of the human society, everyone, has some way or other taken milk. So morally, cow is our mother. How these mothers are being killed? That is the question. Where is morality? Where is...? And they are drawing last drop of the milk. And there is necessity of milk. "After taking whatever money you have got..., take, I shall kill you." What is this? Horrible society. If I take from you whatever you have got in your pocket and then I kill you.... What is this society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The only thing that stops them from killing each other is that there are certain laws. Otherwise, I'm sure that the human beings are so barbaric that they would kill each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, they are making adjustments to the law so that they can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in India, in Vṛndāvana, they are killing now for a little money. They are so poverty-stricken. They have got a clique. Because in Vṛndāvana there are many retired men; they get some money from bank or some saving bank in post office, and they have got clique with this post office man and the bank clerk who has taken money. Bon Mahārāja was attacked. He brought some one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees, one and a half <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees for some.... He was recognized by the.... As soon, at night.... He was living in the Institute. Attacked, in the presence of police. Police was guarding that others may not come to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The police were helping the thieves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think the magistrate even was complicated. And when it was complained, the magistrate said, "Better not to take it seriously; it will be your.... I'll give you some guard."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They'll do anything for money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, in the Kali-yuga, things will degrade so low that if I see I have no money and if you have got some few cents with you, I shall kill you and take it. That day will come. Very dangerous condition is coming forward. Yes, if things go on like this. Just like we saw in Detroit, the whole city is dangerously situated. Therefore nobody purchased that house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Eighty percent of the people in the city are black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the white men, they are very much afraid of these black men. They have to be afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They've taken over the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without them, the factories cannot go on. That's all. The white men cannot work so hard. How they...? No gentleman can do that. This kind of work is meant for the fourth-class, fifth-class men. Therefore they cannot say anything. They require. And they know that their money will be taken away again by supplying them wine. They'll pay, and next moment, the wine merchant will take away. And the government will get huge profit without doing anything. And excise tax. Excise tax, government hasn't got to invest or do anything-simply take the tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Every time they put a tax increase, it's always on beer and cigarettes. Always, every time. And motorcars. Because they know the people are so much addicted that even if they squeeze and squeeze and squeeze, they will still get more, and the people will still pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And addicted people, they, they're after the.... Get money some way or other. Beg, borrow or steal. So these black men especially, they are expert. They are not expert in begging, but borrowing and stealing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Is it possible, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will, in the future, turn the tide and gain predominating influence? Change...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thing is that if the leaders of the society, they come to their consciousness, that this way the society cannot be peaceful, the way they are now conducting.... If they have brain.... Just like the other day, the Christian priest. He was speaking of disabled men. You were present? I challenge you: what do you mean by disabled man? If one man has lost his arm, can you supply it? Then he stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He was finished when you told him it was all imaginary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, actually. What you can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Other than yourself, Śrīla Prabhupāda, no one in the world has a vision how to save the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I honestly think of it. Maybe others are also honest, but they do not know the right way. How they can be honest? Just like this Communist movement. They are favoring the labor class and rejecting the capitalist class altogether. They cannot make any adjustment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I've understood that communism is presented by the administrative class when there is a condition of scarcity. When there is opulence, then there is room for personal individual enterprise, but when there is scarcity, that cannot be encouraged, and the common people have to be subjugated. So capitalism and communism are both simply philosophies how to keep the common man satisfied. So it's simply another means of exploitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is exploitation, and actually they have done it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There is still one class of men living at the expense of another, whether it's Communist.... (end)</div>
