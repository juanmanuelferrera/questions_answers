<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> It's just a club for children, for playing. That's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall go this way or this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> If you like you can go... This will be moist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's no real path there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> There's a path over here. Why don't you go around here. This is an archaeological museum, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Before it was an archaeological museum. Old carvings of various temple deities, but they just keep it like that, so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's not open now, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even it is open what we have to do there? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Like to go this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> "Lesser the happier."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? "Lesser the happier."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsu Ghoṣa:</span> Family planning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā.</span> That is the verdict of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> also. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ. Kṛpaṇā na iha tṛpyanti.</span> One or two child, children, they are not satisfied. They want to produce more and invite distress more. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> But they are practicing in a different way. And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> recommends <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> You know this gentleman? (pause)</div>
<div class="Verse">yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham<br class="calibre2"/>tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.9.45]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Instead of begetting more and more children by sex it is better... Better means <span class="Italic">dhīraḥ.</span> And tolerate the itching sensation. This is recommended. But the itching sensation is so strong nobody can stop. We shall go inside? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, we can walk from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> Unless one diverts attention to Kṛṣṇa consciousness it is not possible. One must have some business, engagement. Just like in New York as soon as there was electric failure for four hours, so many women became pregnant. Because he has no business in the darkness. But if he was trained up to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, one could utilize the time for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. But they have not such training. Nobody has such training. So how they will utilize the time? Come on, let us have... Although he knows...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Especially Prabhupāda, when there is a famine, where there is no more food... They had big famine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Food, that is punishment. It is not the... Famine is punishment from the side of nature. She'll not supply to the <span class="Italic">rākṣasas.</span> That is a punishment. Otherwise, there is no question of population. You may have as many... Just like the birds and beasts. They do not care for... They have got enough food. But they do not violate the laws of the nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> One may argue that in nature there is this leveling out of the species, that one species kills another off so that the population is maintained at the proper level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No species killed by another species. It is rascal proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, members of the species are killed by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. <span class="Italic">Jīvasya jīva... jivo jīvanam.</span> One animal is eating another animal. That is another thing. But that does not mean species finished. That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, I didn't mean. So the human being, the animals can't kill off the human being so that the people have to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The people have to do it to maintain the population level. We have to kill some of the children so that it doesn't become out of control, like the animals do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are less than animal. You are greatest animal. You want to kill your children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsu Ghoṣa:</span> But they have no life. There is only you know an amoeba in the womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't talk nonsense, waste time. All rascals proposal. Don't indulge in this rascal theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Now there is a society for prevention to the cruelty to animals. At the same time they are killing the animals also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They think they can adjust and control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍha</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> There is a preordained <span class="Italic">karma</span> that says some human being should come into existence or some spirit soul should take some body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> How can you reconcile this birth control with that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birth control-by <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> You become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, by this contraceptive and otherwise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is most sinful activity. Birth control should be done by restrained sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That is one way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the way. Other way all sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Sinful, but sinful things are being committed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll suffer. They'll suffer. Those who are killing the children, they will be killed. They will enter into the mother's womb and they will be killed. They'll be punished. Tit for tat. That they do not know. This way or that way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> This way. This way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals, they have no education about this law of nature. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> They're acting very independently. But <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> Rascals, <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra, vimūḍhātmā.</span> They are rascals. They'll be punished. Just like a thief defies the laws of government, but they are punished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Today it's a matter of greatest coincidence. Yesterday got up early in the morning to go for a walk. I thought of Hare Rāma, Hare Kṛṣṇa, then I met you today. Of course, I have no, myself and my wife are life members. We come sometimes, but morning chanting for me rather, it didn't happen. Today it happened and I met you today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I am one of your life members. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think they're everywhere. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> This is Mr. Rajarao, advocate. I am also advocate You understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Ramrao, T. Ramrao.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I am the earliest life member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Extremely happy to have your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About birth control. So birth control means the father and mother, the father and mother should not become father and mother unless they take full responsibility for the children to save them from the repetition of birth and death. This is the śāstric injunction. <span class="Italic">Pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.</span> The, everyone is, in this material world, is going on in the cycle of birth and death. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Transmigrating from one body to another. And after many millions of years he gets the chance of becoming a human being. Now in this life he can stop the birth and death. <span class="Italic">Punar janma jāyate.</span> That is Vedic culture. How to conquer over this process of repetition, birth and death. That is only possible in the human life. A chance is given, and if he misses this chance then again he'll be cycle... Therefore the father and mother's duty is to train up the children in such a way, that this is the last birth. No more birth. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> And that training, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But the things are different. Both the parents and the children, all of them are going again in the cycle of birth and death and wasting the opportunity of getting a human body. This is modern civilization. They do not know this science. They are kept in darkness. This is so-called education. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ paramaṁ mama</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi...</span> They do not know what is the destination of life. In darkness. There is no education practically. The modern education is how to eat nicely, how to sleep nicely, how to have sex nicely, how to defend nice. And that is the business of the animals. They know how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, and how to defend. So the extra intelligence of human being is making a royal edition of eating, sleeping, sex and defense. That's all. What is called? Deluxe edition. The modern civilization is deluxe edition of animal life. That's all. Animal-deluxe edition. That's all. They do not know what is the aim of life. So as you are life member, you should study our, this philosophy. Life members, they are given books. And preach this, and save this human... That is the duty. <span class="Italic">Paropakāra.</span> Human life is meant for <span class="Italic">paropakāra.</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Because they are in darkness, all rascals, <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Nābhijānāti.</span> They do not know anything. And they're puffed up by their false education, false knowledge. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> "Huh! I have no engagement." <span class="Italic">Vimūḍhātmā. Kartāham iti manyate.</span> They do not know how nature's law is working. Do they not know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Since millions of years we are having the births and re-births, both animals and human life and all that. Cycle is going on. So what is the end for this cycle, in the end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the end I have already explained. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Mr. Rao Swami, officer from railway state office. He's from Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You are Bengali? (Where is your home?) <span class="Italic">Kothāya bāḍi āpnāra? Howalajela</span> (?)(Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The cycle is going on. That's what you were saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Cycle, as we see it is going on since millions of years. And it is likely to go on like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You can stop it. You are missing the chance because you are not serious about the end of life. You are not disgusted with this repetition of birth and death. That is foolishness. Just like a thief, a criminal. He is constantly put into the jail but he's not disgusted. He's committing again and again and again. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is going on. This is foolishness. He does not make any provision how to stop it. That is for want of knowledge. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In olden days...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They knew it. That is Vedic culture. Because Vedic culture is from the very beginning. The children were given instruction, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It is said in some quarters that in olden days because of a lack of so many amenities for our life and all that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? What is your ability? Your ability is that you work like an ass and die. That's all. That's your ability. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> What is your ability? Can you stop death? Then what is your ability? You have to die. So it is false ability. It is struggle only. You try to live but nature will kill you. This is your ability.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He is talking of amenities, there are so many amenities now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning of this amenities? After all you are going to die. Your all amenities will remain background. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In this short period of life we have more, rather, material progress, I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you will do with the material progress? Suppose you have got good bank balance, nice house and everything, good society, friendship, relative... But at any moment death will come and kick you out. What you can do? <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> Death will come and will take everything, what you have got. Finished. And he will make you a dog. Now bark. How can you stop it? <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have practiced how to bark in the legislative assembly, now go and become a dog and go on barking. Yow, yow, yow. This is going on. They do not know what is life, what is the purpose of life. <span class="Italic">Asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram [Bg. 16.8].</span> This is going on. <span class="Italic">Asatyam.</span> Somebody says this is false. <span class="Italic">Asatyam. Apratiṣṭham,</span> there is no cause. There is no God. And this is going on. <span class="Italic">Asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram [Bg. 16.8].</span> Everything is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is Indian. Of course, it is meant for everyone, but it was spoken in India, and Indians are rejecting. And if somebody takes it, he misinterprets and spoils himself and spoils others. This is going on. Their modern civilization is trying to mitigate miseries of life. And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> proposes that first of all try to understand what is your misery of life. Do you know what is the misery of life? Huh? What is the misery of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Misery of life is to be like this only. To live like this without the divine knowledge or without...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Miseries of life, real miseries of life that you are soul, eternal. <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span> There is no birth, there is no death. So therefore the birth and death is real misery. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> This is knowledge. But they have no brain. It is clearly said that <span class="Italic">na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span> But these rascals never think "Why I am getting birth? Why I am dying?" So rascal. It is clearly said <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Where is that education? They do not know what is miseries. And they are trying, struggling to get out of misery. But they have no knowledge what is the actual misery. And therefore Kṛṣṇa pointing out, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam.</span> This is knowledge. Simply wasting time. They do not know what is the problem of life and how to solve it. They have no education. So which way? Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Either we can go a little longer and come back, or we can go this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The car is here if you want to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, come on. Let us talk. [break] ...problem of life. But they do not care for it. Nobody is serious about this point, that we learn that I am <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> I am spirit soul, and <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">,</span> I am not finished after finishing this body. Who is caring? Then what is my position? Any gentleman, suppose we have given notice that you have to vacate this house, this apartment. Your term is finished. So he finds out another house. But what these rascals are doing? They are so foolish. The notice is there, that any moment you'll be kicked out. And where you are going? Where to stay? And they are intelligent. And they're intelligent. They are struggling for existence, but who will allow you to exist? That the small brain cannot think. Who will allow you to exist? But they foolishly say struggle for existence. Survival of the fittest. Who is fit? He does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Survival of the fittest theory may be applicable in our spheres because fit means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fittest means who does not get next a material body. He is fit. He is fit. Because as soon as you get a material body...</div>
<div class="Verse">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma<br class="calibre2"/>yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam<br class="calibre2"/>asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">They are mad, working day and night. <span class="Italic">Pramatta.</span> And acting just adverse to his interest. So Ṛṣabhadeva says this is not good. You should know that he has already got a body for which he is suffering. <span class="Italic">Pritar yantra.(?)</span> And again he is creating another body. By his <span class="Italic">karma</span> he is creating another body. So as soon as you get a material body you'll have to suffer. Either you become a king or a dog. Because you have got this material body you have to suffer. <span class="Italic">Pritar yantra.</span> So <span class="Italic">asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> This body will not exist. But still so long you'll exist in this body you'll suffer. But they have no brain how to solve this, although there is solution. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> So <span class="Italic">paropakāra.</span> So as you have become our life member, try to broadcast the philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is the meaning of membership. Everything is there. We have got so many books. At least, thoroughly study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> Yes. Understand the philosophy of life. Apply in own life and try to spread among friends. In your bar library you talk so many things. Why not talk about this? Yes. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Paropakāra.</span> That is <span class="Italic">paropakāra.</span> Everyone is in darkness. <span class="Italic">Durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know the goal of life. Simply by some false hope they are accepting this material thing, material life, as everything. <span class="Italic">Durāśayā bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> External energy. This is the problem. Making plans to solve. No plan will solve this problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then all of us say when the day comes that when all of us can conquer death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then that means in that case no rebirth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rebirth means that... You are eternal. So by <span class="Italic">karma</span> you are put into this material world. So it is a struggle. Just like a fish, somehow or other taken from the water and put onto the land. So he's all life struggling. So he has to be put again in the water. Then his life is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It is back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What is the mystery in that case of universe or divine bringing up this life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bringing up this life? What is the mystery to bringing one to the criminal court? What is the mystery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But we must be some start somewhere. Is it not so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Start means, just like what is the starting point of a criminal? He wants to violate the laws and starting, criminal. You can stop it immediately and you can start immediately. It depends on you. If you violate the law, you become criminal. If you don't violate, remain in your own position. This is the start. As soon as you defy God and you try to become independent, then the starting is there immediately. And again when you surrender, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you stop. So stopping and starting is in your hand. That is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> It is not that starting is done by somebody else. You start your business. And you stop it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, but just in the beginning when the universe started...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the beginning. That beginning is always there. Just like you are a gentleman. You can become immediately criminal. This is in your hand. So you cannot find out the history because at any moment you can start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If the soul was once a gentleman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Ah. This who took the birth of this human being or animal was a gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is gentleman by nature. But criminal by artificial means. As soon as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But even if you attain <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span> is that eternal or just temporary and the until becomes lost, and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mokṣa,</span> there are two kinds of <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span> One, generally, they like that, to remain in impersonal Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> For a limited period.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Limited period, no. Because he cannot remain there. Just like if you go in the sky you cannot remain in the sky. If you don't get any shelter you have to come again. They are going to, trying to go to the other planets, but because they cannot, they come back again. Similarly, you are living entity, you want enjoyment. So what enjoyment you will have in the sky? You require society, friends, love, everything. So these impersonalists, their <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span> is temporary because they think by merging into the impersonal Brahman I shall be happy. But that he cannot. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although they go to the impersonal Brahman, but there is no <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> The living entity is seeking after <span class="Italic">ānanda-mayo 'bhyāsāt.</span> By nature he is seeking <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> So you do not get any <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Is that merger itself not <span class="Italic">ānanda?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> It is eternity, but no <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> So eternally how you can remain without <span class="Italic">ānanda?</span> So you have to come back again. Because here there is something <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> although it is temporary. So unless you go to God and dance with Him, you'll have to back, come. So impersonalists, they cannot reconcile how God can be personal. Because you have got very bad experience of personal here, they think God is also a similar person. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> He thinks God is also a human being like me. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti. Mūḍhāḥ.</span> They are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> They are not intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But what is the stage at which it is <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> gets merged with Paramātmā? If <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> would get merged with Paramātmā then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained. You cannot merge. You simply imagine. Merging means you merge in the spiritual atmosphere, but without <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> you cannot stay there. Therefore you have to come back again to this material world. Suppose you are advocate and you are given some place without any practice. How long you will you remain there? If I say, "Please remain here happily without any practice." How long you'll remain? We want some activities. That is our nature, for <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> But here we are trying to get that <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> but that is temporary. That is not satisfying us. Therefore being disgusted we want to stop it and merge. But there is also temporary. Unless you go back to home back to Godhead, there is no complete life. Therefore Kṛṣṇa comes and shows by His spiritual activities. He's playing with the boys, He's dancing with the girls, He's killing the demons, and so many activities. This is <span class="Italic">ānanda. Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are all spiritual. You have read our <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book?</span> Yes. There is everything. So as far as possible we are trying to give people the real knowledge from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Now it is up to them to accept or take advantage of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Will Swamiji discourse this evening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You are doing greatest service to the humanity throughout the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, I am trying. But it is very difficult. We have to spoil hundreds of gallons blood before one comes to the point. It is very simple thing. Only our leaders of the society, they are sleeping. They are misguided themselves and misguiding others. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Swamiji<span class="Italic">,</span> here is another advocate</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now be advocate of Kṛṣṇa. (laughter) Yes. <span class="Italic">Janma sārthaka kari' kara paropakāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> How long you are going to be in Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going day after tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> To?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm going to Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Most of your time you are in the States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just now I am coming from Europe. States, Europe, then here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What is the method of attaining permanent and impermanent? Permanent <span class="Italic">ānanda?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is spiritual life. When you are not enwrapped with this material body, then is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But that life itself is temporary and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not temporary. That is permanent. That is to stay with God. That is permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But you will do so only so long as you are in your body, is it not? After you leave the body then probably you might attain <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span> for a temporary period.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is impersonalism. And those who actually go to Godhead, they remain in their spiritual body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Between meditation and <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> which is the easier and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana.</span> Yes. Meditation means you'll think of your business and all sleep, snoring. That is meditation. (laughter) (end)</div>
