<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can plaster together, up and down, and each and every one of them is separately sevenfold covered. The watery portion is beyond the sevenfold coverings. And each covering is ten times more expansive than the previous covering. The Personality of Godhead creates all such universes by His breathing period, lies above the cluster of the universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> So there's four... There's water, air, fire, ether, and <span class="Italic">pradhāna.</span> This is given. [break] This should be corrected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Third Canto, it is five coverings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in the Second Canto seven coverings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven kinds of subtle, and these five covering is gross. So subtle should be taken also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes. Is <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> subtle matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> So the subtle is moving the gross like the miller's wheel. The potter's wheel moves the pot. So the <span class="Italic">pradhāna...</span> So the mind is moving the body. So the <span class="Italic">pradhāna...</span> They simply put <span class="Italic">pradhāna...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is mentioned, five, then it is five gross, and seven means subtle. So five or seven... Of course, seven is more explicit than the five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> I never see anywhere where it is mentioned that there's an earth covering. It's always water as the first. Water is the first layer that's given. So there are four of the elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then above water there is air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Air, fire, ether. Water, fire, air, ether, and then this <span class="Italic">pradhāna.</span> So <span class="Italic">pradhāna</span> is split up into the three: <span class="Italic">ahaṇkāra, mahat-tattva</span> and... What's...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pradhāna</span> is material ingredients, material cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Material cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">prakṛti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Is the efficient cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Efficient cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> That is in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> I have the page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Third Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Third Canto. I have fragments of it. Satsvarupa Prabhu gave me some fragments that he had. So I have a couple of books like this. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall put here. [break] ...and you... The New York boys' opinion is to start a press in New York will be nice because there is so many other facilities for press work. If the press goes wrong, there are immediate, I mean to say, what is called, mechanics to repair it. In other places it is not possible. [break] All right. We shall think over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> About the press in New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Well, Montreal center has a room for a press. However, there is the inconvenience that the building may be torn down in two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about that other building, that storefront down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> A storefront downstairs? I don't know all the details about that. I haven't been looking into...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You told me that there is a church for sale on the other side of the park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes, there is. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> It's on Esplanade Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the corner?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> It's on a corner. It's on the corner of Esplanade and the other street. I don't remember. I can go on my bicycle and take a look there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a very big building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> It is a three story house. It is about the size of one of these houses here, not the apartment houses but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, some cross?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes, there's a cross there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pastor, it is written pastor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's small building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> That is small?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> You've seen it. You take walks so far over there? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not a very big building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Not good enough for you. (laughter) Well, there's a synagogue...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what did you do about this building? You have not written anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Well, I haven't had a minute all week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must today finish it. We must borrow type and send it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Okay, I'll finish it today. All this week I was so engaged around the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our engagement should be on that point, that these people will not easily understand, so we are not going to waste time for nothing. If anybody calls for meeting and lecturing, we must charge. Yes. And if they want to hear free, they may come to our temple. Don't become cheap. You see? My Guru Mahārāja used to say that, <span class="Italic">photar kathara sei usane na</span>(?): "If somebody becomes cheap, then nobody hears him." Especially in this country. If you become free speaker, then he's not taken into very seriously. So we must charge. In Boston, all the lectures Satsvarupa arranged, they paid hundred dollars, at least fifty dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> If they pay, then they will have to get something out of it. They will force themselves to get something out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone paid. The Massachusetts Technical College and Eastern University. Eastern University there is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then Harvard University and Boston University, and one church. They have paid, yes. And one church, Arlington Church, in that church... I think you were present there? Arlington Church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Govinda dasi:</span> Unitarian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You have not been in Boston. Some girls from temple, they were present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Govinda dasi:</span> Annapūrṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Annapūrṇa is always present wherever I go. (laughing) She is very nice, that she wants to follow me. This morning I was asking her that "After your marriage where you want to stay?" and she said, "Wherever you stay, I stay." "And I am traveling. Then you are married. You must have a place to settle." Anyway, in that church they charged us for meeting, but we collected very nicely. We collected more than hundred dollars. Yes. A very nice meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> How many people were there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More than hundred, because we collected hundred dollars, and utmost, they have paid one dollar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> The summer season is very slow in Montreal. The churches cut down their sermon program. The synagogues don't having sermons in the summer very often. So that's why we haven't had so many engagements. But in the month of September things begin to pick up faster. The coldest time of the year is the busiest time of the year here actually. The real busy season is January and February.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was speaking to Gaurasundara that Janārdana speaks, "The winter season is the busiest season," and you said, "It is dull season"? (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> January and February are the busiest, and they are the coldest months too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very busy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you are feeling, Śāradīyā? Nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāradīyā:</span> I'm fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are going to Europe? No? You have got to attend your school? That's nice. So your program is starting tomorrow morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Five o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five o'clock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> That's when we have to get out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So you are going by taxi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> To the airport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes, I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You'd have to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Three taxis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why three taxis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Two taxis. There are so many of us and so much baggage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. So for me, I shall be ready to start as soon as we hear from you. Yes. And tomorrow I shall expect mail. I don't think I am going to Vancouver because from Upendra's letter it is not very encouraging, and I don't think Mr. Renogay(?) will, on his personal account, call me and pay me. I don't think so. So what is your next program here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Then the next program here... Well, the busy season will begin. So I'll go to McGill and Sir George Williams Universities and some churches also, and I'll try to get speaking engagements. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Possibly. Maybe I'll find a place on the other side of the mountain for you because the man here insisted if we take this for September, we must take it for the whole year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...means October, November, December?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Until next year in September.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ho, ho! (devotees laugh) That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> That's what he's asking now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Because in the winter season they don't get tenants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Well, a few will get easily tenants, but he wants to get a tenant for the whole winter. And September is a month when there is the best chance for getting a tenant because that's when all the student population comes back into town and this is a student district. And so in the month of September he would like to either get a tenant for the whole year or leave the place open. But maybe I can persuade him because it is not very easy to find a suitable apartment for only one month in Montreal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...pare dhana parke diye nija labha cora:</span> "I borrowed something from you, and I lend him. He does not pay me, and I become thief."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) So... "I borrow from you and I lend him. He does not pay me and I become thief." <span class="Italic">Pare dhana parke diya nija labha cora.</span> So that means this is warning: "One should not do like that. One should not take responsibility for a person where there is no connection." [break] Everywhere the principle of self-interest is there. [break] That is there. But real self-interest is Kṛṣṇa. For Kṛṣṇa we can do anything. Because He is supreme Self. <span class="Italic">Bījo 'ham sarva-bhūtānāṁ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is the Self of selves. [break] Where is Haṁsadūta? What he's doing there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think he's cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cooking? (laughs) He's very expert cooking. (laughs) And Himavati also, assisting her husband?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Haṁsadūta likes to cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Oh, he loves it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he wants to open a restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our, I mean to say, ISKCON restaurant. So you wanted to open that restaurant in our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you do it? He is a very nice cooker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> If he stays here to cook, that's a very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he'll stay. And I have told him already. And I have asked all the students in America chased by this draft board may come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> You're going to have to get a bigger building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There won't be anybody left in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In our connection, our students, let him come here. So these two boys, Jayapatāka and Vaikuṇṭha, in the same process receive. And therefore I was thinking that let us start press and restaurant and engage all these boys. So you can... [break] ...center. Why don't you try for that building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> The building, the Strathcona, the government building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very nice, but other building in front of our temple, just not in exactly front. That big signboard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Oh, 16,000, 15,000 square feet, a dollar sixty a foot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dollar sixty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Yes. We are paying forty-nine cents a foot, and they are asking there a dollar sixty a foot. They are asking three times more rent than we are paying. It's very expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many..., there? 16,000?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> 15,000 square feet. It is a fortified place because they keep furs. They keep animal furs there, and animal furs are very expensive, and thieves very often break in. So I think that one of the reasons why it's so expensive is because it's fortified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> It is a place... [break] ...of animals, and they are very expensive furs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Very expensive. They want a dollar sixty a square foot per year, which is very expensive. We are paying 49 cents a square foot per year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. I thought that because it is a downstairs floor, the restaurant can be started there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Oh, you mean there's another place? You mean that storefront downstairs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Oh, that place... It's a green color and the windows are covered with soap? The windows are painted white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It's a big building, big store. And big signboard. [break] ...shall approach. (laughing) Somebody said, told, that is for sale?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> There is a store for sale. No. I think what they mean, the business is for sale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...prescription, doctors never says in plain terms. Just like at the end of the prescription, "add water." This is real purpose. They will write <span class="Italic">"aqua pureata</span>(?)". Nobody will understand. They will understand. This is also some of the medicine. <span class="Italic">Aqua</span> means water. Similarly, you can say, <span class="Italic">"prasādam</span> distribution," and they will have to consult dictionary, what it is. And you can say, "Oh, it is not restaurant; it is<span class="Italic"> prasādam." </span>So at least...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> No. "Nobody is allowed to smoke in here, and they have to take off their shoes, so how can you say it's a restaurant?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These are technical. [break] ...description, what is called restaurant, that "Wherever foodstuff is prepared and sold, that is called restaurant," then it will come to that category. Whenever they make some law, they give definition of each word, what do you mean by restaurant. So today is another ceremony in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> We couldn't find any barley. What can we use instead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Barley? Why? It is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> The stores are all closed today, and the boys searched everywhere. They didn't find any barley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some grains. Any other grain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> There is whole wheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Whole wheat grains and there's rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rice... Better... Wheat is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> And what else is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sesame?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Sesame? I don't know. Is there some sesame?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Yes, I have some and Annapurna has some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> And there's some buckwheat. Raw buckwheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buckwheat? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> Raw buckwheat. It's a grain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāradīyā:</span> [break] What is the significance of using the barley and the sesame.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some eatables, that's all. Grains are eatables. Therefore I am substituting. They are eatable. There must be something eatable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Does eatable... Does Kṛṣṇa eat out of the fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He does? He eats all that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone eats. Kṛṣṇa also... Kṛṣṇa eats through fire. Therefore <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is offered. Kṛṣṇa eats by so many ways, but people want to see that "I give foodstuff; it must be finished." (chuckles) So for the rudimental seers and the less intelligent class, this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> <span class="Italic">Virāṭa rūpa</span> conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Virāṭa rūpa,</span> yes. That is also nice, right, that through fire He eats, yes, or through the mouth of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and devotees. Two things are there. Therefore, according to the Vedic religion, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> or Vaiṣṇavas, devotees, are invited to take food in some ceremonies. In <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> ceremony they are especially invited with great honor. In pilgrimage somebody goes to Vrndavana, Prayag, Mathura. They invite the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and Vaisnavas so that through them Kṛṣṇa is eating. They have come to satisfy Kṛṣṇa in a place of pilgrimage. These are the systems. So for the purpose of eating, so many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> have sprung up. Because <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are invited, so so many so-called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> there. They'll be present when eating, and when there is chanting of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> they are not present there. [break] Baby has also <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> (chuckles) She is very happy. You see? I never seen such small child not crying. That means she is always happy. She's not crying means... Because baby cries when there is discomfort. And with her face shows that she is very happy. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> [break] ...Swamiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Thank you. [break] ...see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl Devotee:</span> (inaudible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Just see. All very healthy, I see, because very energetic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāradīyā:</span> [break] Simply by Your Divine Grace, on Kṛṣṇa's appearance day in San Francisco my mother came to the temple and she wore a sari and a <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (chuckles) You are converting your mother to this cult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> A very nice mother she has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless mother is good, how the children are good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Tora(?). Tora is one of the biggest, and he helped more than anybody. He would come home, and she would read to them from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> But he would tell her, "Oh, if you don't serve Kṛṣṇa, you must serve <span class="Italic">māyā." </span>And he would say, "That's <span class="Italic">māyā." </span>He would tell mother that at seven years old, and he would explain to her. Swamiji, by the end of our classes, he was actually understanding the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> being able to listen to it and ask questions about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He gave you questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Even at the temple when there would be lectures, and then the lecturer says, "Are there any questions?" Tora would raise his hand, and he'd ask very intelligent questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why not keep him with me, your mother and he? (devotees cheer)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Oh, ho, ho! Haribol!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think your mother will not agree to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Maybe his mother needs him. The mother needs Tora to keep her in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] He's going to be a Nārada. Nārada, when he was five years old, he was thinking that "My mother is too much attached to me." And when his mother died, he thought free. "Oh, I am now free."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janārdana:</span> At the age of five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, at the age of five. And at once he went out. In his previous life. Then from five years till the end of life he cultivated Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and next life he became Nārada.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Oh. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think that is described in the first part of our <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> That story is there, how he convert, how he became Nārada. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Twice a month he would visit his father. His father is a demon. So Tore carries in his pocket one nice picture of Swamiji and one nice... On the back is written, <span class="Italic">tava kara kamala vare.</span> And he sits and says that under his breath because if his father heard, his father gets mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the age for injecting Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If children are taught Kṛṣṇa consciousness from this age, the face of the world will be different. [break] ...but they are not Hindus. They have got also obstinacy like that. [break] It is very important. "I thought in that way. When my mother died, as the devotees of the Lord think, I also thought in that way. What is that? 'Oh, it is a grace of the Lord. My mother is now dead.' Because she is the, I mean to say, real cause of my nonfreedom. So she is now dead. Then I am free." It is very contradiction from the materialistic point of view. It is said that, <span class="Italic">bhaktanam śam abhīpsataḥ.</span> "As the devotees think, so I also in that way thought." What is that? <span class="Italic">Anugrahaṁ manyamānaḥ.</span> "I thought it a special grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." <span class="Italic">Anugrahaṁ manyamānaḥ pratiṣṭhāṁ disam uttaram:</span> "And I at once took leave of my so-called home and went away." So that is the difference between the devotees of the Lord and materialistic persons. When their materialistic relationship, comforts, are taken away, they think "Oh, it is all grace." And the materialistic person, when their materialistic comforts are increased, they think, "It is grace." <span class="Italic">Yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasmin jāgrati saṁ...</span> That is also stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like... There is a crude example. I think I have cited this example many times, that a foolish patient thinks that increase of fever is very nice. Fever, so what should be the ideal? Fever should decrease. But those who are less intelligent, they think, "Yes, it must increase." (chuckles) There is a drama in Bengali that in a house a doctor came to diagnose. There were two patients, the housewife and the maidservant. So doctor said, "The maidservant's fever is 105, so there is some anxiety. I give some medicine. And the, that landlady, she has no fever practically, 99, so there is no anxiety." But the landlady became angry, that "This doctor is useless. I am the landlady. I have got 99, and my maidservant 105. And maidservant should have 98. I should have 110!" (laughter) This is the mentality. The modern civilization is trying to increase the degree of fever to 110 degrees. And, you know, as soon as the degree comes to 107 it is death. Do you know that? If the fever increases to hundred and... Therefore as soon as the high fever is there, the doctor try to decrease it by icebags and so many things because to come to the fever degree, 107 or 8, means immediate death. So the modern civilization, they are trying to increase the degree of material fever, and they have come to the point, 107 degree-atomic bomb. Now they are going to die. You see? The American atom bomb or the Russian atom bomb will kill the whole material scientists' advancement. You see? So this is the... So, and devotees, they want to decrease the fever. Decrease the fever. Therefore the highest, ideal life, according to Vedic civilization: <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> Vaiṣṇava. They decrease their demands of the body. Minimum demand. You see? There is amongst the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> not now, in the Vedic system, the <span class="Italic">uñca-vṛtti.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">uñca-vṛtti. Uñca-vṛtti</span> means they will go the paddy field, and after the cultivator takes all the paddies, some paddies are thrown away. They will collect those paddies only. Just like birds, they collect. They collect those paddies, and that they will eat, not even beg, ask anybody for any morsel of food. So completely... And in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> Śukadeva Gosvāmī recommends that "Oh, this open field is your bed, this is your pillow, this is your pot, and the water in river is sufficient water, the tree is full of fruits, and in the cave, there is sufficient apartment. So why should you go, anyone, to ask for your shelter, for your food?" <span class="Italic">Kasmād bhajanti kavayor dhana-durmadandhān:</span> "Why should you approach the materialistic, puffed-up, monied men to give you some help?" So Śukadeva Gosvāmī was strictly following this, strictly following, completely independent. That is not possible at the present day. (chuckles) If we imitate, that will be not good. We have to depose(?). Our Gosvāmīs, they have prescribed <span class="Italic">yukta-vairāgya:</span> accept everything in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Then it is <span class="Italic">yukta-vairāgya.</span> It is also <span class="Italic">vairāgya. Śuṣka-vairāgya</span> and <span class="Italic">yukta-vairāgya. Śuṣka-vairāgya</span> means simply renunciation without assimilation. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī</span> sect, Śaṅkara sect, they have got stringent laws for renunciation. But Vaiṣṇavas, they have no stringent law. They accept everything as <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prasādam,</span> actually offering Kṛṣṇa, working for Kṛṣṇa, living for Kṛṣṇa. This is the best use. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, "The best use of a bad bargain." Everything in Kṛṣṇa relationship. That is <span class="Italic">yukta-vairāgya. Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate. Vairagya</span> means detachment. So when we are attached to Kṛṣṇa, automatically we are detached to <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Not artificially we want to be detached from <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like theoretically I know that I am not this body, but the bodily necessities are there because I am encaged in the body. Therefore the bodily necessities-eating, sleeping, mating, defending-should be done in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Then it is all right. Then my consciousness is always in Kṛṣṇa, and I am detached to my bodily demands. And those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, their bodily demands is on the materialistic platform. They are going on, increasing the degree of fever and coming to the 107 degree. You are also going tomorrow?</div>
