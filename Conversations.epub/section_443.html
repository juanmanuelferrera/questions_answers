<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...only barrier. The meat-eaters cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said, "Let us go on to higher topics. We've just been talking so long about meat-eating."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You said: "Well, if you're sinful, there's no question of going on to a higher topic."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is specially mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata: vinā paśughnāt. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād<br class="calibre2"/>bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt<br class="calibre2"/>ka uttamaśloka-guṇānuvādāt<br class="calibre2"/>pumān virajyeta vinā paśughnāt<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Everyone can understand the truth except the rascals who are meat-eaters. <span class="Italic">Vinā paśughnāt. Paśughnāt. Paśu</span> means animals, and <span class="Italic">ghna</span> means killer. Christ therefore first says, "You shall not kill." These rascals are killers from the very beginning, and they're continuing. <span class="Italic">Vinā paśughnāt [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">paśughna,</span> they cannot understand. They're thinking, "We are doing very good work, philanthropic work, opening hospitals and public roads, and every ten years, we are fighting and killing all the men population." They're happy. They are taking credit for these big, big buildings, but this is <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina</span> because simply these buildings are meant for committing sinful activities. That's all. "Wine, women, meat-eating, gambling. We are civilized." [break] ...this Geneva very many churches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Many churches in Geneva? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Not so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means godless. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I first came to America, Butler, in Pennsylvania, that is small county, but at least one dozen churches I found. I very much appreciated, that the people are not... And they're going regularly, churches. I was invited in many churches. I was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> To lecture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The, the girl, that, my friend's son's wife... He's Indian. He has married an English girl. So I was guest at his house. So that girl, Sally... Selly or Sally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Sally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She was arranging so many meetings. She was very intelligent girl. So churches, many churches, she... Some of the churches purchased my books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Recently, one of our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> parties went to Butler, Pennsylvania, and one of the devotees met a priest on the street. He said: "Oh, yes, I remember your spiritual master. He was here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I was giving lectures. They have churches. That means God conscious persons there. I never criticized church, mosque, never. Because whatever it may be, at least there is God consciousness. So they're good. In details... But when they disobey... I criticize only these rascals, disobey the commandments. Otherwise, we have no... We don't criticize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We're not sectarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We're not sectarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? God is one. Why we shall be sectarian? According to his circumstances, he is doing. And that prayer is also <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> offering prayer. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanaṁ vandanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">vandana</span> is prayer. So that is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> one of the items of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Everyone needs to be encouraged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Everyone needs to be encouraged in their God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam. Bhaktiś cen nava-lakṣaṇā. Bhakti</span> is demonstrated in nine different symptoms. So <span class="Italic">vandanam,</span> offering prayers, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it required for them to have a spiritual master to guide them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. These rascals, the priest, they do not guide them. They are also fallen. Otherwise, Christian religion is very nice. If they follow. So many times they asked me. "Yes, if you follow your Christian religion, you'll be perfect." Caitanya Mahāprabhu proved devotional service from Koran. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> The Khān Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So it requires the devotee who can explain from any godly literature about God. How rascal they are! "Jesus Christ ate fish. Therefore we shall maintain big, big slaughterhouse." Just see the argument. Then, in the Bengali, <span class="Italic">mosa makta kanan</span> (?). There was a mosquito, and one is asking, "Bring a cannon." "Bring a cannon." <span class="Italic">Mosa makta kanan.</span> Jesus Christ ate somewhere. There was no food available to eat, might have. Accepting he ate, but that, does it mean that you have to maintain slaughterhouse? Just see. And besides that, he might have done anything. He's powerful. He can eat. Therefore the other day I said, "He can eat the whole world." But you cannot imitate. You have to follow his instruction. That is Christianity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Many of the young people now, they look to the Bible for instruction, but they don't like to go to church at all. They feel that the church is hypocritical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hypocritical, simply hypocritical. All these priests and cardinals and popes, they're all hypocritical. Getting high, highly salaried, high salaries, and drinking wine. And in America there is a hospital, five thousand drunkard priests are admitted there to cure their drinking habit. That was published in a paper. And they're sanctioning man to man marriage. That was published in that, what is that? Watch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Watchtower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Watchtower. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They did a survey among the Catholic priests...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this? They do not fight. Why there is soldier? (laughter) What nonsense. Why there are soldiers? The neutral? 1939. This is Second World War. And First World War, 19...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (reading) "Dedicated to the soldiers of Geneva who died in the service of their country."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means it was attacked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Probably defending banks or things like that. Civil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two wars, 1914 to 1918.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Devotee:</span> They have big military poems. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Devotee:</span> Many, many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> We read in the papers, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that they did a survey among the Capucine priests and fifty percent felt that their spiritual life was hampered by the fact that they could not have intimate relations with women. And forty percent felt that they were not allowed enough freedom and that obedience was not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not allowed in...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Enough freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Illicit principles. Sinful principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...fig, there are thousands of seeds. And each seed contains a tree like that. And there are thousands of fruits, figs. Where is that chemist who can prepare such figs? One, in Delhi, when our festival was going on, we invited a big chemist. He admitted that "Our chemical advance, scientific advancement is like this." He explained very nicely. You were present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Delhi? He said that a man who has learned the art to, what is called, barking like dog, and people will go to see, purchasing ticket, ten rupees, twenty rupees, how the man is barking like a dog. And there are so many dogs barking. They won't see. This is our advancement. If a man has artificially learned how to bark, they'll go to see by paying fees. And the natural barking, they don't care. So these rascals are like that. They're trying to manufacture life. And so many life is coming by nature's process, millions and millions, that is no credit. And he's trying, utopian, he'll create life by chemical combination, he's given all credit, Nobel Prize: "Oh, here is a man." This is rascaldom. So what credit you'll get. Suppose if you can manufacture a man or an animal in the laboratory, where is your credit? There are many millions and millions are coming automatically. We are trying to give credit to Kṛṣṇa who is making all this creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There is one Englishman named Aldous Huxley...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...who wrote a book called "Brave New Worlds", and in that book, he predicted something that's coming true now, that there would be a process of biologically screening babies so that men could be breeded like animals, like they breed animals. So they would take one strain of chromosomes and breed a class of men who would make perfect administrators, and then they would breed another class of men that would be perfect <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> and they would breed another class of men who would be perfect scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is already there. <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> The, the, in Vedic astrology, <span class="Italic">jāta-karma,</span> they will say that "This child is a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> this child is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> this child is a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span>" By the birth, by the constellation of the stars, it will be done. It is already being done. And in the medical laboratory, the blood has been tested, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, śūdra, vaiśya,</span> there is different blood. Yes. The blood infusion. So if the, a different blood is infused, it does not act. So one doctor, in India, he was permanently keeping different bloods for different persons. So there is some meaning in the caste system. But that is not... In a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> may also take birth. <span class="Italic">Śūdra</span> blood. So to keep the blood brahminical, therefore the reformatory system is there, <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra</span> and all the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras.</span> Before birth, they keep, to keep the blood brahminical, there is ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yesterday you said when one becomes initiated by a bona fide spiritual master, his body changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Even if he was <span class="Italic">mleccha,</span> he can become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Actually, the chemists also say that there are four types of blood, A, AB, O, and something like that. They give it four names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And according to Hindu system, the marriage was taking place finding, examining the girl's constitution and the boy's constitution so that there may not be disruption. Everything was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The Vedic system is so scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. That is human civilization. That is Āryan civilization. Vedic civilization means Āryan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Hitler also wanted to produce a pure breed of Āryans, but artificially. He just said anyone who is German-born, they are the pure Āryans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But so much freedom in sex, how the blood can be pure? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...but <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he's neutral always. He's not affected by all these qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I guess the blood becomes purified like that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I said that "You scientists, you are simply wasting time." Did I not say that, last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Childish. Just imitating barking of the dog. That's all. And he wants to take credit by imitating barking the dog. And the real dog is barking-no attention. Actually, that is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They say that if a dog bites a man, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that's nothing special, but if a man bites a dog, that's news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) Yes. Just like the men ate some human flesh. That became news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That airplane crash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is their business. [break] ...is when the dog barks, that is not science. When the man barks like a dog, that is science. Is that not? The man, how scientifically he has learned how to bark like a dog. This is their aim, how to imitate dog-barking. This is scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> On a morning walk in Los Angeles, Svarūpa Dāmodara said they are now going to produce babies in a test tube, and you said "But that's already being done in the womb. That's a very nice test tube." He said, "But he'll get a Nobel Prize." So that's the example. Nature's already doing it nicely. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...produce even a green grass like this in the laboratory, what to speak of other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If producing life was worthy of a Nobel Prize, then they should give every mother in the world a Nobel Prize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Actually, I think they should give you the Nobel Prize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You've been creating devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I, I am natural dog, and they'll not give me prize. (laughs) They'll give prize to the artificial dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Bad imitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> (about statues?) There is that Pan god again, imitating Kṛṣṇa with a flute and standing like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He's naked, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That's some goddess of music with a harp. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...brain, they have created something, but it will be used for sinful activities: drinking wine, meat-eating and sex. Not for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina.</span> They use their brain, but for sinful activities. This is <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> There's the verse in the Second Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that what is night for the materialistic man is the time of awakening for the introspective sage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> These scientists, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say that their research is neutral, and it is not their fault that the use of their discoveries is detrimental. Like that man yesterday, he said, "It is not my bomb."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then whose bomb?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, their point is, like, for example, Albert Einstein. His idea wasn't to create the atomic bomb, but with his theories, the government agencies had men produce the bomb. So they're saying: "Why should you blame us for all the chaos and havoc? All we're doing is simply researching nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He has got animal hoofs, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> From the waist down, he's an animal. He has hoofs instead of feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What are they called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Centaur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Centaur, centaur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That's in the Greek... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> ...if they give up the four sinful activities, then they might be able to understand the Vedic philosophy. So does this imply...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Vedic philosophy. They will understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So does this mean that by their activities that they're engaging in now their incentive is that they want to enjoy these four sinful activities...? And that really they're not looking for truth? That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no inquiry for truth. Animal life. As soon as there will be inquiry for the truth, that is human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They will naturally perform some <span class="Italic">tapasya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then other things will follow. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> They do not inquire. That means animal life. As soon as there is inquiry, <span class="Italic">jijñāsu, jñānī jijñāsu...</span> They're not <span class="Italic">jijñāsu</span> even. Neither <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> (pause) The path must be very old. The trees are very aged. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...yesterday said, when you said that one must be pure before he approaches God, they said, "That's spiritual pride." They said, "That is not good to say first we have to be pure. Like egoism," they said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll tolerate material egoism, "We are doing this humanitarian service." That they... And spiritual egoism he'll not. That I replied, that this is real egoism, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> And I'm: "<span class="Italic">Ahaṁ</span> dog <span class="Italic">asmi.</span>" (laughter) That is not very good pride. [break] Why not make one world? That I said to to that man. Why do they not do that? Everything belongs to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> In the Vedic times also, just a few thousand years ago, there was one monarch also, one king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they were subordinate to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> But now, countries like Switzerland, they're afraid that if there is one kingdom, they will lose their standard of living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Their nice standard of living will be lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? The standard of living should be one: plain living and God consciousness. That is the disease. Everyone wants to enjoy this material world to his best capacity. Therefore we divide. They don't want to live in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Material consciousness. Enjoyment of the senses. And that is the cause of their suffering. Only on account of this sense gratification, they're creating different mentality, and, after death, they're getting different body. That they do not know. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu.</span> One is trying to associate with the goodness, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, brāhmaṇa</span> qualification, he'll be promoted, and one who is trying to imitate, "I shall be as powerful as the tiger," he'll be degraded. It is nature's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, one person asked the other day that "You say that we have a choice, that either we can surrender to Kṛṣṇa, or we can remain under the control of the external energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> And his question was that those in the mode of passion and ignorance, do they have any choice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone has choice. Everyone has choice. Choice, but under the control. Exactly like that. By your choice, you go to the prison house. By your choice, you go to the university. There is supreme control, government. But it is your choice, whether you want to live in the prison or in the university. that is your choice. Government does not say that "Oh, this man will come to the university, and this man will go to the prison house." No. You make your choice, you work according to that, and government sends you either to the prison or to the university. You cannot say... One man is condemned to be killed for murdering, another man is rewarded some prize, you cannot say government is partial. You have made your choice, and government is giving you the result. (pause) Once you make your choice to steal, then you are under prison house. Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Choice to...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To steal.</div>
