<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> "...all wealth, all strength, everything that you could possibly ever want." And He's offering to everyone, "So just surrender to Me, and I will take complete charge of you." But people are so foolish that they don't do it. They don't take any notice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why...? Suppose a big man, Rockefeller, says, "You simply surrender to me. I will take charge of you." Immediately one takes up. So why the man does not take Kṛṣṇa's word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They are envious of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Envious of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, envious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Men are such a great fool, they have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> That is perfect word. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtiṇo mūḍhāḥ prapadyante [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">. Duskṛtino mūḍhāḥ,</span> the most sinful rascal, he does not surrender. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So for one who gives up sinful activities, does his sense of God consciousness become awakened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is chance. Sinful activities means covering intelligence. Just like animals. A tiger is always engaged in sinful activity, but he does not know it is sinful. There are so many animals. They're simply engaged in sinful activities. Therefore they are excused that "This tiger.... His business is to act sinfully." Therefore God has given him place in a jungle: "You live there, and your sinful activities will not be taken into account."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: :</span>Yesterday this man was finding difficulty discriminating between good and bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The gentleman who came yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal. He is another rascal. Everyone is like him. Therefore we call everyone rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> The common philosophy in America is "If it feels good, do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "If it feels good, do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...man is less. He is simply beating drum. [break] ...the reason? Nobody can explain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> That they won't surrender?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They have no confidence that Kṛṣṇa is there to actually fulfill responsi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say He is imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Asurim bhavam asrita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is due to sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Duskrtino mūḍhaḥ.</span> Anyone commits sin, he is a rascal. Ordinarily also. A person kills somebody-that means he is rascal. He is rascal. He does not care for the law. That means rascal. So any sinful man is a rascal. Without being rascal, one cannot commit sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Last week in Bombay, Śrīla Prabhupāda, an American astronaut that went to the moon, they asked him if he experienced God or he felt some help from God in his trip. And he said, "No, I had no religious experience. God must have gone the other way."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Which way was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said that when he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He went to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> When he went up in the space capsule to the moon, he had no religious experience, so he thought that there was no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So space traveling induces a man to accept God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it's a material conception, that God is in the heavens, above the clouds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> According to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. Beyond this material universe, very, very far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hrdayananda:</span> But another astronaut who went, he had religious experience, and after coming back he became missionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Another astronaut went insane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And another astronaut went insane, like a madman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. What was the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> For his insanity? He could not explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Insanity is also a result of sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Too much passion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? We live in this material world, and we're in so much ignorance that we don't know who it belongs to. Is that due to sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We live in the material world, and we don't perceive who it actually belongs to, like living in a house, not knowing who the owner is. So is this sense of ignorance due to sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Suppose if I go to America and if you do not know what is the political constitution of America, how the country is being managed, that is my foolishness. I must know that in America there is a president, the government is like this, the law is like this. Then I am intelligent. And if I do not know anything, if I think everything is automatically going on, then I am foolish rascal. They think like that, "Everything is going on, nature." They cannot explain what is the nature. Even this flower growing, the tree is growing; foolish people say, "This is nature," but intelligent person knows what is the law behind it, acting. That is intelligence and foolish. Nothing can happen. These big, big so-called scientists, they are talking of accidents. That is another rascal. Accidents, why? Why accident? This flower is not growing in this tree, and this flower is not growing in this tree by accident. Why it is not happening? Accidents means that. There is no law. Something happen without any law. That is accident. But we are generally seeing that this flower never grows in this tree and this flower never grows in this tree. Where is accident?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> It's not accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> It's not accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but they say. They have got a big theory, accident theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They say that in due course this will evolve, that just as this flower, this tree is giving this flower, this rose tree, so after generations, generations of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have to believe these rascals, "in future." That is the same post-dated check, that "You take this ten thousand dollars. It will be paid three hundred years after." So I will have to accept that. I am not such a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say, "You have to look back into history, and you'll see how history will repeat itself in the future."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that history? The rose flower gave birth to lotus flower? Where is that history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> This is what they say, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that.... Therefore they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...at one time that all the vegetation was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. Therefore they are rascals. Now they say, the Darwin rascal says, that from monkey man came. Why the monkeys now do not give men? That is rascaldom, false theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> They say they can make crossbreed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. You are the cause of this crossbreeding. It is not accident. You are making arrangement; therefore it is.... There is cause. It is not accident. There is no accident. [break] ...man promises that "You just surrender to me; I will take care of you, everything," so whether I shall do it or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they do not do? Kṛṣṇa says that "You surrender, and I take care of."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> " 'Cause Kṛṣṇa is not here. We can see the man, and we can see him giving us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he has no eyes to see. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. I say <span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-sthaṁ paramāṇu-cayā...</span> Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. He is within your heart. But that means you are rascal. You do not know to see Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "But that's conditional."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "If I surrender to the big man, he should give me anything I want."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so Kṛṣṇa says that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> But Kṛṣṇa says, "You cannot do this. You cannot do that." Therefore it is conditional.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda :</span>"Ultimately I know that Kṛṣṇa takes away everything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no surrender. You do not surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "But I know that Kṛṣṇa takes away everything from His devotees ultimately, so I don't want to surrender."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good for.... That is good for you. Just like the physician says that "You surrender. You don't eat these things. I'll cure you." Will you accept this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> "Well, when Kṛṣṇa will give me His mercy, then I'll surrender."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> "When Kṛṣṇa will give the mercy, when He wills it, I'll surrender."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is already giving you, because without Kṛṣṇa's mercy you cannot live for a second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "So similarly, when He desires I serve Him, I will serve Him. But now He is not desiring."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They would say, "We are living and we are not serving Kṛṣṇa. You are living and you are serving Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he is.... That is another foolish question. He said that "You do it." He is not desiring? How foolish that is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "But He is not inspiring me to do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is inspiring? He is directly saying, "You do that." Is not instruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "But He's not inspiring me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how fool. He is saying directly, "Do this," and still He is not inspiring. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He says that "Only by His mercy I will be able to do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> "He says, 'Only by Kṛṣṇa's mercy I will be able to surrender to Him.' So His mercy is on you, but His mercy has not come to me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you don't accept the mercy, then whose fault it is? I am giving you mercy: "You take it." And if you do not take it, then it is my fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "But I don't want to surrender. I want to be Kṛṣṇa. I don't want to serve Kṛṣṇa; I want to be Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that you have tried for millions of lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "So I'm a rascal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "I have so many plans, though. Someday..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Therefore you are rascal. You have tried already. Kṛṣṇa has given you chances. "You wanted to become this? All right, you become this. You wanted to become this? All right, you become this." So that you have tried, but you have failed, and still, "All right, go on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "But I am a fool, so I will keep trying. I will not surrender to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They like to be a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> They say, "You Westerners have enjoyed the material life, and we have not. Therefore let us enjoy, and then we will become."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that enjoyment? Is that enjoyment? They are working so hard for ten rupees. Is that enjoyment? The enjoyment is "the future, future." "At night I shall go to my wife and enjoy"-that is enjoyment. But for that enjoyment he is working so hard. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everyone is thinking, "I shall enjoy at night," and working hard. That's all. This is enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> "But why do you blame us for not surrendering when we see that even Kṛṣṇa's devotees can't surrender to Him? They come to us and ask us for money for these books. Why don't they give them away?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa's devotee.... When he surrenders, he is devotee. When he does not, he is not devotee; he is trying to become devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> "But why do they ask us for money for these books? Why don't they give them away, if they're so surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I give you? Why shall I give you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> "Kṛṣṇa says He is the proprietor of everything. Why He has to ask me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> "Yes, why is He asking us for money?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And He is proprietor of your money. Give Him. (laughter) I think our Girirāja played this trick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. I have also played the same trick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And one boy gave his all money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They say it is all one. So I say, "If it is all one, then it doesn't make any difference if you have the money or I have the money, so give it to me." It works. They don't like it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you give it. "Your money is my money; my money is my money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In your article, though, you said that Dhṛtarāṣṭra said he was better than the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> because they were coming to him, begging for money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] "...beg. They help you. You are keeping Kṛṣṇa's money; you'll be punished. So return it to Kṛṣṇa; you'll be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Voluntary disclosure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Voluntary disclosure. [break] <span class="Italic">...abhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ paramam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Prabhupāda, why is it that a devotee falls down, that he wants to surrender to Kṛṣṇa and again he falls back to the material world to become a false enjoyer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's more sinful. <span class="Italic">Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> He has not yet finished his sinful activities; therefore it takes some time. Neither he surrenders fully. Just like somebody said, "I want to enjoy material world." Just see. That is sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa will protect any living entity who surrenders?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even from all sinful reactions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if he surrenders actually. He says. He says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> That surrender has to be with perfect knowledge, or else it won't be strong enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he surrenders, the knowledge will be there. That knowledge.... It is very psychological. If you surrender.... If I surrender to you, I must have some conception that you are very big. That much conception will help you, not more than this. Simply accept that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva karma kṛta haya.</span> If you simply understand this, that "If I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then everything is in my knowledge..." <span class="Italic">Sraddha śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya, kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva karma...</span> And then he becomes immediately. And if I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then my life is successful. This much. Is it very difficult?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> No, it's the easiest thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kavirāja Gosvāmī has explained very nicely. This is <span class="Italic">viśvāsa. Śraddhā śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya.</span> Explain, Acyutānanda, this. Explain this.</div>
<div class="Verse">śraddhā śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> If you have firm faith in Kṛṣṇa and surrender unto Him, then all other activities and responsibilities are fulfilled by serving Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dāya mama gelā; tuwā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tuwā o pada baraṇe</span>(?) This is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Serving the root.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "My only responsibility is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa"-then this very conception will save you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I spoke with one man who argued that "Kṛṣṇa is very cruel because He knows everything past, present and future, so He knew that we would all fall down from the spiritual sky, but still, He gave us the independence to fall down."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Even though He knew we would fall, because He knows everything..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That's a common question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolish question. Unless you have got independence, what is your life? Then you are dead stone. You want to become a dead stone? That is not Kṛṣṇa's concern. Kṛṣṇa does not give such perfection, that you become a dead stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "The thing is that because Kṛṣṇa knows the future, past, present, and future, so He knew that we would fall down, so why didn't He help me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, future means, just like.... This is the law of nature, that if you steal, you'll be punished. So if I say, "Oh, you are stealing; you'll be punished," this is future. Suppose this is the month of March, and if I say, "In the month of July there will be rain." So I know; you know; everyone knows. This is not a future telling. The natural sequence is everyone knows it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But does that means that Kṛṣṇa doesn't know something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa.... If everyone knows, why Kṛṣṇa does not know? "He knows everything" means this common sense everyone knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Does He know what you will choose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Just try to understand. Future means like this: nature's law; and it will happen. After summer there will be rainy season; it will happen, and they will call, I am foretelling future. It is not future; it is natural sequence, automatically happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But that's predictable. If I have my own free will, what I'm going to do, you don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if you are in knowledge, you can predict. But if you are fool, you cannot say. If I see that in July there will be rain, and if you are a fool, you'll protest. That is your foolishness. It is natural sequence, one after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> When is the natural sequence...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Natural sequence.... Just like you are infected, some contaminous disease. You'll suffer. There is a story that one fool was sitting on a branch of a tree and he was cutting off. And somebody said, "You'll fall down." "Ha, fall down." But when he fell down he said, "Oh, you are a great astrologer." So who goes to the astrologer? Only fools and rascal. No sane man goes. They know that what is.... <span class="Italic">Yad bhavyantam tad bhavata</span>.(?) What is to happen, that will happen. Why shall I go to astrologer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> I can prepare myself to make change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. My only business is to serve Kṛṣṇa. I don't mind what will happen next.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That desire to serve Kṛṣṇa, though, that Kṛṣṇa....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't talk like foolish. That desire everyone has. He is serving. He is serving so many things, but he doesn't want to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is his foolishness. He is serving <span class="Italic">māyā</span>; still, he denies to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is his misfortune. <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> So unless one is very fortunate, he does not agree to serve Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So that future is determined by the great souls, such as yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Because you are creating people's good fortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fortune, there. It is already there. I am simply informing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, but you actually engage them in <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛti,</span> meritorious activities, even unwillingly performed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this is the duty of everyone. One should not.... That is enjoined in the.... <span class="Italic">Gurur na sa syāt:</span> "One should not become a guru if he cannot do that." Otherwise he is cheating. Why he should become guru? Why he should accept service from so many people if he cannot rightly direct them? Then he becomes bound up by the <span class="Italic">karma</span> laws. If I take one paisa from you without any service, I have to pay you four paisa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> In the spiritual world the living entity is full of knowledge, so does he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is enjoined, ordered, "You should not become guru if you cannot save him. You should not become father if you cannot save him." This is sastric injunction. First word is <span class="Italic">gurur na sa syāt pitā na sa syāt.</span> Why you are claiming? Just like.... We are not going to become guru like that.... What is that rascal? Yogi...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Which one? There's many rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That big rascal, transcendental meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Maharishi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maharishi. He is giving assurance, "If you practice this yoga, then you'll be very able to do your business nicely. Your..." These things are.... And he is guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> And he charges them a fabulous amount of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, unless...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> That verse, <span class="Italic">guravo bahavo santi śiṣya-śāntopahārakāḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they say to their friend that "These people want to be cheated. Why shall I not cheat?" He says. One of his secretaries came to him.... "If you want God, then go to Bhaktivedanta Swami."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> He said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said, this Mahesh Yogi. "My business is cheating because the rascals wanted to be cheated. So why shall I not cheat and get some money?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> But he doesn't give the money to you, though. He knows you are real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.... Not.... That is another thing, but he knows that "God consciousness you can get there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yesterday you said that one cheater takes from the other cheater; so he is a cheater, he is taking from other cheaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> You mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that one cheater takes the money, another cheater takes it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, his business is cheating. His business is cheating. He said, "These rascals want to be cheated, so why not cheat?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So we shouldn't be so angry at him. Some people are serving coffee because people want coffee. Some people are selling <span class="Italic">bīḍīs</span> because people want <span class="Italic">bīḍīs.</span> So if some people want to be cheated, so he is simply performing a function of society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the world. Therefore the whole world is the society of cheater and cheated. That is the version of my Guru Mahārāja. The whole so-called human society means a bunch of cheaters and cheated. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> says, <span class="Italic">asuryā nāma te lokāḥ.</span> He is going to hell even though he knows that he is cheating. He is also going to hell even if he is consciously cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So don't be cheater; don't be cheated. That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is our fortune that we've come in contact with a qualified guru? What have we done to qualify to come in contact with you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> In other words, why do some come and others not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛti,</span> say. <span class="Italic">Ajñāta-sukṛti.</span> You might have done something, very pious activities, which you do not know, but on the effect of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So it seems like it's up to chance, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No chance. Just like a sinful man. Some saintly person comes to him and he gives some money to him. He does not know that "I am doing very pious activity," but because he has given, he becomes pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If not even a blade of grass moves unless Kṛṣṇa sanctions it, then why does someone have the opportunity to perform such <span class="Italic">ajnata-sukrti,</span> another person not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa wants.... Suppose a saintly person comes to a very sinful man. He needs some money. Immediately Kṛṣṇa says, "Give him some money. He requires." So he says, "All right, sir, take it." So Kṛṣṇa's desires, he gives. Unless Kṛṣṇa dictates from within, how he can give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> So then where is the question of free will? If I want to give or not give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, free will under Kṛṣṇa. You can become free will and become a big man immediately. Your free will sanctioned by Kṛṣṇa. You are not so free that whatever you like, you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So even if I want to perform some <span class="Italic">ajnata-sukrti,</span> it is only by Kṛṣṇa's mercy that I will do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Verse">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍe bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva<br class="calibre2"/>guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti latā bīja<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">As soon as he gives to a saintly person, <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> he immediately acquires some asset of future development. Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> If someone gives to a person for spiritual..., consciously for spiritual improvement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...and the person misuses the money, does he benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> If a man says, "I am giving you this donation because it is a spiritual organization," but if the money is misused, does that man benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If money is misused, then both of them become implicated. If it is not used for Kṛṣṇa, then both of them becomes under the laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But that man is sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, this word sincere, there is no meaning unless he is a devotee. <span class="Italic">Ei bala ei manda sab mano dharma:</span> "These are all mental concoction." There is no meaning. "This man is good. This man is sincere. This man is bad. This man is..." They are all mental concoction. Only good is he who is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Others all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> So if Kṛṣṇa has given the dictation, then is He dictating every sinful man to give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Is he dictating every sinful man to give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you question like that? Kṛṣṇa is so foolish that He will dictate to give to a foolish, er, sinful man? It is odd question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> This is that point that does one come to..., does one get contact with a pure devotee and advance like that from his own free will, from accepting the mercy of the spiritual master or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does he say? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> The point.... The point...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Not every sinful man is dictated to give money; otherwise they'd all be giving us money. They're all sinful. We'd be getting money from everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But then the question is why some and not others also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Kṛṣṇa is in everyone's heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> But some are innocent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's dictation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And you cannot bind Kṛṣṇa to dictate in a similar way. If He likes, He can ask a sinful man, "Do this." If He doesn't like, He may not act. That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So ultimately it is simply by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...that he comes back to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So it is Kṛṣṇa's business where to show mercy, where not to show. You cannot oblige Him that "You show mercy everywhere." No. <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-maya-samāvṛtaḥ</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa.... You cannot oblige Kṛṣṇa, "You do this." That is not Kṛṣṇa. That is not Kṛṣṇa. If one is obliged to act to your dictation, then he is not Kṛṣṇa. Therefore whatever Kṛṣṇa likes, He'll do. You cannot oblige Him that "You have to do it." No. That is <span class="Italic">karma-mimāṁsa,</span> that "If good work gives good result, so why should we care for Kṛṣṇa? We shall do the good work." That is.... Ordinary people, they think like that. <span class="Italic">Karma-mimāṁsa.</span> "If I do good work, Kṛṣṇa will be obliged to give me good effect. Why shall I care for Kṛṣṇa?" That is <span class="Italic">karma-mimāṁsa.</span> "Work is final. Do good work, that's all." They say like that. But we say, even if you do good work, if Kṛṣṇa does not want it, then it will not produce good result. That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> We don't have the mercy of Kṛṣṇa yet, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Everyone has got the mercy, but that mercy is not obligatory. If He likes, He can give you mercy; if He does not like, He may not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> But everyone has it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone.... He is giving mercy. That is general. But if He does not like, He may not give you. You cannot make Him obliged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So why is it, then, if it's a question of <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛti...</span> The Indians, from their birth they're watering <span class="Italic">tulasī,</span> they're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, they're doing so many activities, but mostly your disciples are foreigners?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that.... No, means that is temporary. They may come again. It will never go in vain. Just like this cloud. Cloud is meant for raining. Now it is not raining, but when there is sufficient cloud, it will rain. You cannot say there is no rain. There is, but it is not sufficiently collected. When it is sufficiently collected, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> like in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa gives certain criteria...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, one cloud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is superior direction. It is not your direction. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Kṛṣṇa explains why He comes at a certain time and He says, "I come whenever there are certain conditions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not "certain time."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Does He ever say, is there any statement in the <span class="Italic">śāstra...</span></div>
