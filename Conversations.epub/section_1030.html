<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...required to kill somebody, he'll do that. If it is required for his sense gratification. There are many instances that a woman is addicted to another man and she has killed her husband, killed her son. Why? Sense gratification. I have seen one woman, my Godbrother's wife, she killed her son for being implicated with another man. I have seen it. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Things which are not to be done, they do it. Why? For the matter of sense gratification. They do it. That's a fact. So therefore simply for sense gratification they are prepared to do anything. That means <span class="Italic">pāpa.</span> It is the verdict of the court that when a man kills another man he becomes mad. Without becoming mad a man cannot kill another man. So everything is being done which is not sanctioned because for sense gratification. The whole world is (indistinct) is sense gratification. And at the end, when he's little spiritually inclined, he wants to satisfy senses by thinking artificially that "I shall become God." That is the greatest sense gratification. "Because remaining a small living entity I have been hampered in my sense gratification. Now let me become God so that there will be no restriction of my sense gratification." Bhagavān (indistinct). Because he has failed to satisfy his senses remaining non-Bhagavān, now he wants to become Bhagavān. Yogi, that is also another sense gratification. That if I show some magic, if I can create little gold like this, hundreds and thousands of men will be after me and I shall live, very nicely. Gratify my senses. These things are going on practically. The man who is manufacturing gold, and so many rich people are coming to his disciples and he's begging for a motor car. If he can create gold, why he cannot create a motor car? This is going on. (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> In my opinion you should. That road is very bad. Five or six kilometers they have raised the road by about six or seven feet and all this is all mud and muck and the car skids. In my opinion you go via Aligarh.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I remember that you had written yourself that there is something we can do together. Possibly this question, building and all that. (indistinct) It is good to have that building and that land, but even before that there is work to be done at the Kurukṣetra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is that Kurukṣetra is the place where <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken. So if we take the words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> as it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, then people will be benefitted. But if we do not take the words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then <span class="Italic">moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ [Bg. </span>9.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> That I believe.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not direct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Putting in your interpretation, that is wrong. It should be direct. That doesn't mean only those people who have accepted this can come together.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, we have made, you must have seen our literature, <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> as a text, but still people may not judge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we should not depend on the people's acceptance only. We have to present <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> as it is. Now everything is not accepted by everyone. Even if you make change, there is no guarantee that they will...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I am not trying to make a show. I believe a direct interpretation is important thing more than the other kinds of ideas and conceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo<br class="calibre2"/>mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>rākṣasīm āsurīṁ caiva<br class="calibre2"/>prakṛtiṁ mohinīṁ śrītāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.12]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go on, go on. I have given any purport?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional service-going back to Godhead-will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. In other words, persons who mock Kṛṣṇa are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, </span>such demonic miscreants never surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Kṛṣṇa are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with Kṛṣṇa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra </span>and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>always baffled.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of Kṛṣṇa. In the <span class="Italic">Bṛhad-vaiṣṇava mantra </span>it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of Kṛṣṇa to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the <span class="Italic">śruti. </span>And if one by chance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection. People jeer at Kṛṣṇa because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I was reading this yesterday, the Eleventh Chapter. There are twelve, twelve chapters. There Kṛṣṇa Bhagavān had a dialogue with Uddhava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He's referring to <span class="Italic">Ekādaśa-skandha</span> of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uddhava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> And there I felt, I thought that whenever we meet I'll bring up this question with you. 'Cause the way in which it has been translated in Hindi which I read it does create a little question as to what Bhagavān Himself said about the status of the soul, the individual soul, and relationship, (indistinct). Because although I think I should have got it, they don't give it to the life members.</div>
