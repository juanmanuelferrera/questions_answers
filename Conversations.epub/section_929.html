And our rascal Indian leaders, they are also. What is that here, she has remarked, "Hare Kṛṣṇa cult."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Who said that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have one cultural organization, they want to export yogis and teachers who they approve of, the Indian government approves of as being bona fide. Because the American government, so many people are complaining, about misrepresentation by these Indian swamis and so-called yogis that are coming over. So they put Guru...., the Divine Light Society...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They said that once this is established there won't be no room for the Divine Lightists, the Hare Kṛṣṇa cultists and like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> TM. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Really.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> A hundred and sixty nine <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A hundred and sixty nine <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> per year, inviting foreign countries to lecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And only a handful came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only a handful they had, something like sixty people. They spent two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what culture they'll speak? (Hindi) They can speak, "Milk is dangerous and meat is very nutritious. Kill all the cows. Oh yes, it's very scientific." This is the cult(?). "Milk is dangerous." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, they're saying that, the doctors nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember one day you retorted that. You said that "Milk is nothing but the blood of the cow transformed. And [sarcastically:] the milk is bad but the blood is good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They scare people by saying that milk helps to create heart disease, and artery disease, like that. They frighten people with that propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Meat creates cancer of the intestines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Actually, there have been some articles in papers lately about meat and cancer, linking meat and cancer. Prominent, prominently displayed articles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you give milk to the children? Give him blood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They say past a certain age...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this propaganda-milk is bad-so why from the very beginning you give milk to the children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Actually, in America they do not feed the children by the breast. They use cow's milk practically from birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was an article in the newspaper about that today. Very interesting. It said in the newspaper that if women stop breast feeding their children they will have to increase the population of dairy cows tremendously. A very small percentage do now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have to increase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> More and more cows to produce enough milk to feed children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore we are killing children. There is no problem, we shall kill our.... Why do you call? Let us kill, wholesale. And go to ball dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The whole civilization is complete crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kartikeya told me. After many years he went to see his mother, and mother was going to ball dance. And mother said, "Wait, I am coming back." And he was surprised. He told me. Son has come home after many years, and she could not talk with him. She was going to ball dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It actually is that way. It actually goes on that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Completely callous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Not even mother love anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother killing. He was about to be killed. He admits. His grandmother advised the mother. Yes. Kṛṣṇa saved him. Because he is devotee, some way or other, he was saved. Your grandmother still living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you say, (laughs) "You wanted to kill me, just see, I'm chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't think it would be received very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> She might say, "See, I was right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother advising young daughter to kill her child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Actually there was a statement in the national magazine, the President's wife was advising her own daughter to the reporters that she should have illicit sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, this President's wife, this present First Lady is very abominable. She actually came out and said, "If I were young I would also experiment with drugs." So many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why here? In India, in India, in a office, I was going there for my Back to Godhead, so the clerk had one girl, they were intimately related, and the girl's father, mother allowed. The boy was coming. And when the girl wanted to marry him, the father refused. "No, no, you cannot marry. Let him come as friend, but there is no question of marriage."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What was their purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purpose is that "You are young girl, you can have a young boy as friend and have your sex, but don't talk of marriage." This is the plain fact. "You need sex? All right, keep him as friend. Marriage, that I will select a better boy. When we find, then there is question of marriage. He's a clerk, how you can be married with him? He's coming as friend. You enjoy sex, that's all." This is the.... First of all, he was ordered not to come. Then the girl began to cry. Then he allowed, "All right let him come but there is no question of marriage." Why he? Our, that (name witheld). You know? He was Ambassador in Germany. His daughter is a devotee. That boy who was selling books? (name witheld).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (name witheld)is the girl's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Her father said "Yes, you keep as friend, don't marry." The (name witheld), Mr....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said that concerning (name witheld)and her?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (name witheld)is living with her at her father's house. So he did not object but he objected marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard she became impossible. (name witheld)left her. He couldn't bear associating with her. Now he's <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> again. (laughter) That was one of Bhagavān's marriages that didn't work out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We were thinking that just like when you were in Moscow, some pictures were taken that were used for <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> very good propaganda. We were thinking maybe when we go on this tour that in front of the White House maybe we could take a picture and use it in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> in an article like that. It might be good propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So we were thinking we would go there to the White House on the first part, then to Capitol, second part, then around to Lincoln Memorial, then Monument for fireworks ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will go to the fireworks. (end)</div>
