<div class="Purp-para">(in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The religions' editor for one very big newspaper is coming, and he has asked if it is possible he can interview you for his newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that's all right. He's coming at ten o'clock and then I'll show him around, so maybe by ten-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Before the massage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's right time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...widespread, Śrīla Prabhupāda, very widespread. Now I'm afraid about it being in New York, because one of the leaders has been.... I just found out that he's one of the leaders. He's been in New York for about three weeks on his way to London, and he's a <span class="Italic">pūj...,</span> he has his own Deities which he has on the altar, which means he's talking to our <span class="Italic">pūjārīs.</span> I am, I have to get back there as soon as possible to see. They have like a newsletter they send out all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They mail it out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, well it's a bunch of notes they mail out on a regular basis. It's really poisonous. Pradyumna has been investigating. He got a bunch of their notes photocopied. The one thing I've noticed about the people that are involved with this, two features I particularly have noticed. One of them is that they don't go out on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> Everyone I've seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then everything will be finished. Preaching will be finished. In this <span class="Italic">sahajiyā</span> party, then preaching will be finished. <span class="Italic">Siddha-praṇālī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What does that mean, Śrīla Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">siddha-praṇālī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Siddha-praṇālī</span> is nonsense. They have manufactured a <span class="Italic">siddha-praṇālī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...the initiation that you are given your <span class="Italic">siddhas,</span> your eternal position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are some very strange notes. You should see those notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, I've read them all already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You did?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have learned it from these Rādhā-kuṇḍa <span class="Italic">bābājīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From Rādhā-kuṇḍa <span class="Italic">bābājīs</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bābājīs,</span> yes. After all, they're fool, rascals, so whatever they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The dangerous thing is that they are using your book for authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Authority, where? What is that? That I've already explained. Why these rascals do not take the lessons of Caitanya Mahāprabhu that we are all rascals, fools? No. That they will not take. They'll take the Rādhārāṇī's <span class="Italic">bhāva.</span> What Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching by His practical life, that we have to take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There is one statement, Śrīla Prabhupāda, regarding devotional service in a reverential mood. So they have found some quote, they are quoting, that this reverential devotional service is an impediment towards developing pure love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another place they quote that regulative principles are a hindrance on the path. Because there's a statement that I think Yāmunācārya says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a statement somewhere in one of your books that when one attains the highest platform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is that highest platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, there's no question of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One must go through stages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You gave the example of trying to get an M.A. degree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One has to come to that highest stage. It is not forbidden. That may be ideal, but not for the neophytes. You must.... One who does not know ABCD, what he will know about M.A. degrees? That they do not know. They think that they have already passed M.A. degree. That is their fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's another statement, I saw them, where it says, it's a quote, that you can treat Kṛṣṇa as your lover and Kṛṣṇa will reciprocate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And they underlined the two words "you can" treat Kṛṣṇa as your lover. In this way they're taking your quotes out of context.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is one of their main, the main ideas in their philosophy is that the living entity can desire to have any relationship he wants with Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, he can desire. I already explained: first deserve, then desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Rāmeśvara:</span> Deserve then desire, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are rascal, how you can desire? You have no qualification, you desire to high-court judge. What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But then they have an answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That "Let me just try it anyway, to keep my mind thinking..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can try it? First of all, be qualified, a big lawyer. Then you become high-court judge. Where is that qualification? You are after illicit sex and <span class="Italic">biḍi </span>and you want to be associated with the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that "In ISKCON, we do not..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them say all nonsense. They are disqualified. <span class="Italic">Sahajiyā bābājīs,</span> that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's about forty of them in this temple. Fifty. There's fifty of them in this temple, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A women's group and a men's group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a women's group with about twenty-five or thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing is that they're going around and they're soliciting for people to come and join their group, and then immediately they come, they immediately take them into all the details of the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> with Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let them.... Unless they follow the regulative principles, there is no place for that in the temple. Let them go out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their fault. They want to utilize the love affairs of Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> for their debauchery. That is a support for their debauchery. That is <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the meaning of <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that's on their minds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are restricting, "No illicit sex." They will put that "Here is illicit sex between the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> and Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we can also do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Breaking the principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti</span> is a gradual process, they immediately want the highest perfection quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the danger. But if they at once go to <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā,</span> because they are not trained up neither they are liberated, they'll think this <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā</span> is just like our young boys, young girls mix together, have sex like that. So it is supported our.... "Why should we restrict to no illicit sex, no this, no rules and regulations? We shall do all nonsense." That's all. And become a <span class="Italic">gopī.</span> It is very good to aspire to become high-court judge, but how you can become high-court judge without qualification? That they are not thinking. They have no qualification, they have illicit sex, pregnant, going to abortion, and they're high-court judge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say Ajāmila had no qualification and he just chanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ajāmila had no qualification. Therefore they should have no qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say. Now you accept them as authority, "They say." What is they? What they are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ajāmila's qualification was he thought of Kṛṣṇa at the time of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you cannot think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They want to think of the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> at the time of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they will think of at the death, why you are conjecturing now? Their habits are rascal, they're making pregnant, illicit sex, what they will think? Anyway, if we give indulgence to these people, then this preaching work will be hampered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we're not going to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or they should be separated. Otherwise, it will be bad example, and all restrictions will be broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If they don't change their mentality, then they should live separately, do their own society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they'll do that. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) That <span class="Italic">sahajiyā</span> tendency is very easy to take up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It seems like it's an inherent thing in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thinking of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> that is in liberated stage, not in the conditioned stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I could never understand, Śrīla Prabhupāda, why, I was always wondering why in all of your books you're always blasting so much time on the <span class="Italic">sahajiyās,</span> and I was not.... Now I see why, because the tendency is so easy. I could never, I'd always think, "Why is Prabhupāda saying so much? Because they're only in India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's thinking that this is a small group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, in India, but now I see it's an easy mentality for anyone's mind that can be adopted. That's why Prabhupāda was stressing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And as our movement gets more and more members, there will be more and more people who will be exhibiting this <span class="Italic">sahajiyā</span> tendency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why it's in every book Prabhupāda speaks about it without fail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, keep your movement very pure. You don't mind if somebody goes away. Don't mind. But we must keep our principles pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I always remember that you said that in the battle sometimes some men may be lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Natural. Of course we don't want to lose men, but it's natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the devotee is in the original relationship with Kṛṣṇa, his <span class="Italic">siddha-deha,</span> why is it that he sometimes changes his original <span class="Italic">rasa</span> with Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Each one of us has an original relationship with Kṛṣṇa, some as plant, some as tree, some as cow, some as cowherd boy. So if that is re-established, why should the devotee desire to change it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is spiritual kingdom. You can change if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is not static, Prabhupāda once explained. Love is not static.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally, it is not changed. Just like mother Yaśodā, she's mother all the time, eternally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The question came in Bombay two or three years ago. Prabhupāda said that it is not static. You can have (inaudible).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I always understood before that the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> was fixed, but that within that <span class="Italic">rasa</span> one may take different..., one may take a different line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be revealed when you are liberated. Why you are bothering now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A patient is thinking, "How shall I dance when I become healthy?" First of all, rascal, become healthy, then talk of all this. The rascals are thinking like that. You are patient; first of all cure your disease, material disease. Then talk of all this. Utopian. "When I will get rich, how I shall treat.... I shall.... Then my wife is disobedient and I shall kick her like this," (laughter) and as soon as he kicked on the earthen pots, all broken. Then he, "Oh, then my.... All prospects have gone." You know this story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What was in the pot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That.... A potter, potter boy, he had got some earthen pots selling. So he was dreaming, that "By selling this earthen pot, I'll make so much profit. Then I shall purchase another batch, I shall make profit. In this way, I shall be millionaire. Then I shall marry, and my wife must be very obedient. Otherwise I shall kick." So in this way, he kicked over the pots and (laughs) all of them broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And in the end, nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So by his dreaming he, he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, first of all be rich man, then do all things, how you shall kick your wife. This is going on. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "My Guru Mahārāja found Me rascal number one; therefore he ordered, 'You cannot study <span class="Italic">Vedānta.</span> You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.' " They will not read this portion. That Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He posed Himself as a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they prefer to read about all the ecstatic symptoms on Caitanya Mahāprabhu's body</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That.... Be, first of all bona fide. That is good ambition. But how this good ambition can fulfill when you are a potter, poor man? Actually be rich, and then kick your wife. And without being rich, if you think all this nonsense, you're spoiling time. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, some devotees, sometimes they feel that in ISKCON we're talking so much about the business of how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but we're not talking enough about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-kathā,</span> they say. So that's another reason why they want to read all these pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let them read. What kind of <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-kathā</span>? The <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-kathā</span> test is as soon as he'll get the taste, he'll lose this taste. That is the.... What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Won't it purify them? That's what they say, "It will purify me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you are purified? You have become a, what is called, putrefied, not purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You can become purified, and sometimes you can increase your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You can read. Be purified. You can read. But where is your purification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Putrefaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The books are there for reading. By reading, you become purified. [break] In 1935, our Guru Mahārāja, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, he went to Rādhā-kuṇḍa for <span class="Italic">kārttika-vrata.</span> So at that time he was reading <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads.</span> So first of all, these <span class="Italic">bābājīs</span> they were coming. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had come at Rādhā-kuṇḍa. He's giving some class. So they used to come. But as soon as they saw that he was reading <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> they stopped coming. They saw: "They are <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they are not <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did they want to hear? <span class="Italic">Daśama-skandha?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like that. So Prabhupāda condemned them that "They are not living in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. They're living in Naraka-kuṇḍa." I heard it, "They're living in Naraka-kuṇḍa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So our men who go to Rādhā-kuṇḍa and live there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're risking living in Naraka-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember one boy was living there for about three months, and you got very angry and told him that there were already enough monkeys in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Do not try to jump over like a monkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] The scientists have found some more brass pottery. So now they say that man first started using brass around thirty-five hundred years ago. They've announced this to the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they're not using?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> No, they say that thirty-five hundred years ago is when man first started using brass. They've announced this to the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What we have to take lesson from this, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're still using it now. Does that mean man is still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are convinced that man used to live in caves, and just recently he has been civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the effect of civilization? When they used to live in cave, they were hunting animals and eating. So you are doing the same thing. What civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Except they're doing it on a bigger scale now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned that it would not be possible for them to find the remains of the bodies of the Aryans because they would burn their bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So they only find the bodies of the lower class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Similarly, they only find the remains of the cave dwellers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Also you've said that now they're headed back to caves to hide. By the end of Kali-yuga many will live in caves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even now there are people living in caves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They were living in caves then, and now they are living in pigeon holes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> There was another article in the magazine that was talking about rats in India. This article was talking about rats in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rats?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes, they said how there's a big problem. There's too many rats. And at the end of the article they made a sly comment about how many people considered the rats sacred. So this is a big problem. Whenever they make some report about India, they always make some joke about how the people will think the animals are sacred and how this is actually the real problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why do they not go and eat the rats? Then why these people do not go there and eat the sacred rats? Please go there and eat the sacred rats. (laughter) Because you are expert in eating animals, so go and eat the sacred rats. lndia is a good field, and clear their problems. You write one article and send them. It is a good opportunity for the animal eaters to go to India and eat the rats, sacred rats, and solve their problems. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> It won't even cost anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, free. They can take them free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣabhadeva:</span> They said one of the main reasons is because they are killing the snakes for the skin, the snakes that feed on the rats. They kill so many snakes to get the skin, therefore there's no way to control the rat population.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. It is saved for you. Go and take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> They wear the snakes and eat the rats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Snake will die of starvation. It is better. You go and eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Egypt, they have been able to dig underneath the ground and find the remains of ancient cities. So this is proof of the ancient civilization of Egypt. But they have not found ancient ruins of the cities of Dvārakā or Hastināpura. They do not have such...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> There are ruins in Dvārakā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they do not accept that the ancient civilization of India is old, very old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I read one anthropology book, and it said that about 3,500 years ago in India people were only living in all the caves, and they were simply using stones and things like that, very primitive tools. No knowledge at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> But they cannot explain how it was that these people evolved, these cavemen evolved such a language as Sanskrit, which not even the greatest scholar today can even begin to comprehend. It is a very great language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their grudge. When they see such exalted literature, they are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why don't we cut over?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, we can walk over this way? There's no water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was all manufactured by the Britishers. To keep their faith with other nations, they were protesting that "Why you are keeping India dependent?" So they were pleading that "We are making India civilized." That was their propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "The white man's burden," they called it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> The entire Golden Gate park was cultivated by men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Instead of planting grass by the roads, they are now putting green rocks. They figure it looks the same, and it saves money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> They are also planting plastic grass in the middle of the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In Russia now they have declared one..., that it is a big crisis. Because their grains did not grow properly, they are not able to produce as much meat, so now one day a week everyone is forced to eat fish. So they are lamenting. They were describing how..., about the good old days were when you could go and buy an entire carcass.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> is meant for fasting, either Bhīma or Arjuna. But we cannot fast, therefore we have to take little fruits and.... Otherwise, <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> means fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If it is possible, should we go without eating at all?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you heard from Paramahaṁsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> No, I was in the room. It was when he was trying to observe <span class="Italic">Caturmāsya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I never said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Oh, okay, I must have heard wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is service and, on my fasting, service will be stopped, then I can take. First consideration, service. Now if somebody feels weak, he can take <span class="Italic">mahā-prasāda,</span> render service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That priest that has now become your disciple, he's joining Satsvarūpa Mahārāja's party. He's very interested, and Satsvarūpa Mahārāja has said he would like him to come to travel together and study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinīkaṇṭha:</span> In the West, people are generally unfamiliar, I think, with the philosophy of Śaṅkara, yet in your books you devote so much argument to defeating Māyāvāda philosophy. I was wondering if it is within every conditioned soul's heart to be an impersonalist. Is it.... Does every conditioned soul have the propensity for impersonalism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they cannot understand God; therefore it is impersonalism. It is due to their poor fund of knowledge. So most people are in poor fund of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> As soon as one forgets Kṛṣṇa, he's impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Just like many of us, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were thinking, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot think that a person, how he can produce a sky? That is beyond their conception. This is their illusion.(?) They say God is all-powerful, but He cannot produce a sky. This is their defect of knowledge. If God is all-powerful, why He cannot produce a sky? That they cannot think. Yes, He's all-powerful, cannot produce a sky. Their intellect. Poor intellect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Many of us were also thinking God to be impersonal before we met you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> We were not attached to that conception. When you explained personal nature of God and the many arguments in favor, gradually we were convinced. But then there are those also who are attached to that conception, like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says those who are attached to that conception...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can see every day the impersonal feature of the sun-the sunlight, the sunshine. But which is important, the sunshine is important or the sun is important? Daily we see. The sunshine is spread all over the universe, very big. But what is the use of this big, if there is no sun globe?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for Kṛṣṇa. For Kṛṣṇa, you fast or feast, the same thing. Better fast. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...by the devotees, is that in the spiritual world every day is feasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is no fasting. Fasting is recommended when a man is diseased. When he's in health, there is feasting. So spiritual world means health. Why there should be fasting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And our disease is uncontrolled senses.</div>
