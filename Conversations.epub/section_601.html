<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car) So do these people know what is the science of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No. But they pretend that they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, pretending will not do. You must explain what is God. "Something," "perhaps," this is not science. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...if no one else knows, they're able to fool them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Each man presents his own theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is theosophy, that is not theology. Theosophy means a system of speculation, that's all. And theology does not require. Biology. Logy means science. They say anthropology, but it is not logy; it is theory. "Maybe," "200,000,000's of years." What is this? Logy does not mean that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Still, they're awarding Ph.D.'s in theology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like astrology. That is a science. Eh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> But still they're awarding Ph.D.'s in theology, even they don't know anything about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do. <span class="Italic">Hiranda-pitha drumayate.</span> When there is no tree, the small castor seed oil tree... It is not much. It becomes a very big tree. <span class="Italic">Hiranda-pitha drumayate.</span> The castor seed plants, they are taken as big tree. [break] Actually, theology is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, that's nice. Very good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suitable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (walking) ...means science of God. So what is that science of God? Who knows it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadvaita:</span> You do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of God means first of all we must know who is God. This is the first. Then, what is this material world and what is my relationship with this material world and God. This is science of God. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...you wanted the colleges named the Vedic Theological College?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hm. Don't come very near. [break] ...that the college teachers and students must be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> not <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdras</span> will not be able to understand the science of God. What was the... Now, Dr... What is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Dr. Mize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Mize? So what does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He said that he could give up the greed, but the lust was a very hard one for him to give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmadhyaksa:</span> He wanted to become more unselfish, but he didn't know how he could give up lust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that can be done. If you increase your Kṛṣṇa consciousness, love for Kṛṣṇa, then you will forget this lust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmadyaksa:</span> That's what we told him, that he must chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the only. That is the only. There is no other second way. [break] ...conquer over lust, one has to take shelter of Madana-mohana. <span class="Italic">Madana</span> means lust, Cupid, and Kṛṣṇa is Madana-mohana. He can enchant the Cupid also. [break] ...Ṭhākura, young man. At dead of night the prostitute came. How he restrained? That is... One who has realized Madana-mohana, for him these things are nothing, no enchantment. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmadyaksa:</span> ...impressed with Your Divine Grace's energy and ability to work so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you do not say, "This is spiritual energy"? Yes. [break] ...got so many dogs nonsense. And it is solved. Just see. And he has brought dozens of... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...life will be empty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actually that is a fact. No family, no children, so they must have some. The dog is their children, family. That is the attraction for..., because mostly they do not have family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They kill the family before they're born.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And then, instead they get dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be something to repose my love. So they have no family, no Kṛṣṇa. So naturally keep dog. [break] ...must be there, to love. That is my tendency, but if I have nothing, then I will have to catch the dog. What can be done? [break] ...furnish this television. Dog and television and whiskey and cigarette. That's all. (laughter) Is it not? [break] ...in India these things are entering: dog, television. And cigarette, wine, has already entered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is the degradation. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So much sex, everything you watch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And not only that, horrible scene.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Killing and like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmadyaksa:</span> They sit hypnotized. They say we are becoming hypnotized by chanting, but actually they are hypnotized by this TV set.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that I have already explained. We must be hypnotized. If we do not become hypnotized by Kṛṣṇa, then we must be hypnotized by this television and other. [break] <span class="Italic">...pūrṇimā?</span> No. Full moon, last night? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think the full moon was Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Monday? [break] ...how many pages yesterday delivered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> I finished a hundred pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Today I will finish the rest of Chapter Thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is decided?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That he will travel with Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you can do that. They are composing hundred pages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Daily?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Not a hundred pages. A hundred verses, each person. Each composer, one hundred verses approximately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And one verse means one page average? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Two verses per page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Two or three verses per page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So between all the composers a hundred pages a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, between all the composers, more than a hundred pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> We are going fast enough so far to do the seventeen books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> I think in one week we'll be able to finish <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā,</span> volume three, and <span class="Italic">Antya-līlā,</span> Chapter One.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> I went to the press right after <span class="Italic">maṅgala āratrika,</span> and one of the composers had already run out the door of the temple room, and she was composing already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] Pālikā is also doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> She's going to school now. she's learning how. She will start tomorrow, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In a few days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is very expert. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> ...all night long and they are not getting tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Spiritual energy does not get tired. That is spiritual. When we get tired, that is material. Spiritual means one would not feel tired. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Vardhanam</span> means increasing. [break] ...has not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He left last night for Las Vegas. He will go to Denver. He will see you there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last night at two o'clock (chuckles) he took film.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yadubara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You were translating, he was filming? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...night I was working from half past ten. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No sleep, that's all. [break] ...sleep, utmost, one hour or one and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is it proper to say that your purports are getting better every day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know that. (laughs) You think so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Dr. Kapoor has commented, "The purport is superb."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he has said that. [break] ...from these waves how these birds catches...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fish. You cannot fish, but they know how to fish. They can see and immediately catch, while in the water. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...given them the facility that they need for survival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the... <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> They do not know industry. (laughs) So they have to catch their eatables from the nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The scientists say that everything has developed due to the need for biological survival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...is of the body, not of the soul. That they do not know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> ...because a certain animal needs a certain type of facility like long claws or big teeth or a certain amount of legs, they say that automatically in the course of time these things develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we know also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> They don't say that it has anything to do with God. They simply say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their nonsense rascaldom. Who is arranging this? You cannot do it. You cannot do it. So somebody has arranged like that. It is going on. Somebody has done. You have not done; neither you have power to do it. So that somebody is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> The same scientist-his name was Lamarck-he said that the giraffes have long necks because after many, many years of trying to eat leaves from trees their necks got longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He says the giraffes with the long necks in Africa their necks... Formerly their necks were very short, but they were always trying to eat the leaves on the top of the tree, so by doing this for many, many years their necks became longer, longer, longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Darwin's theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. [break] Gradually, they'll become pigeons. Because they want sex life so much, so more and more they'll develop the bodies of pigeons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the thing is who are they? That they do not know. They say "They are," but who are "they?" That they do not know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> In <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> both, you explain there are five states of consciousness, beginning with <span class="Italic">annamaya, manomaya, pranamaya,</span> like that. Do these states of consciousness manifest in different species of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes? So like plants for example, they would be in the <span class="Italic">annamāyā</span> state of consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Simply eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...in Vṛndāvana, as they will be advertised, many people will come, more people, because they will come rather surprisingly, "How the Europeans, Americans have become devotee and they have their temple?" That will be attractive for them. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Should they advertise like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is automatically being advertised. Just like our Māyāpur mandir is known as <span class="Italic">"Sahib mandir.</span>" (laughs) <span class="Italic">Sahib</span> means European. [break] It is said that... Where is Nitāi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Nitāi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That visitors coming in full bus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes, yes. Yes, I have seen in the evenings many buses will come and park there. Everyone will get out and go see the Deities, take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> take books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So gradually it is becoming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadvaita:</span> The buses come from town or from Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> No, from Vṛndāvana. Tour... many pilgrims come, groups of pilgrims who are staying some place in Vṛndāvana, and then in the evening they will all get in their bus and come out and see our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Pilgrims come from all over India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when they will go back to their villages, they will advertise, that "There is a European temple now in Vṛndāvana." And they will come. (laughs) And even the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they are saying that is the best temple in... Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... But actually that is the fact. That is the fact. Our temple is the best. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmadyaksa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you make a best college. Yes. Vedic Theological College, affiliated to the California University. Then it will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> People are always anxious to see what we are going to do next.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Even in Rādhā-Ramaṇa temple they were asking when is our Vṛndāvana temple going to be opened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> ...police are also becoming very favorable. Even when they arrest us, actually they want to hear Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (Prabhupāda laughs) When they arrest us, while they are writing the tickets, we read to them out of the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was child, His mother's friend would tease Him so that He may cry, and then they will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and He will stop. To see that by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa He is pacified to see this fun, they would tease Him first of all, and He would cry, and then they will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and they will... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> In New Jersey one time we were driving very fast to try and meet you at the airport, and a police officer pulled us over, and he was very angry. We were driving very fast. And he said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you should not drive fast. (devotees laugh) No, no, this is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> We had to pick you up at the airport, Prabhupāda, and we were late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but fast, drive very fast, is risky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> So this police officer he pulled us over. He was very angry. He said, "Let us see your license and registration." We gave it to him, and it said International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness on the registration. He said, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa." And he asked us some questions about the philosophy, and he listened very carefully, and then he said, "I cannot give people like you a ticket." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they are pleased, but don't take undue advantage. Yes. [break] ...remain friends. That is wanted. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> When they arrest us we read to them out of Kṛṣṇa Book, the pastimes, and they listen the whole time. And sometimes for an hour and a half, two hours, they'll listen to us while we preach. Then they let us go. [break] Sometimes we are about to make an announcement to collect donations and the police officer will be standing there like this, like he doesn't want us to do it. And we go up to him and say, "If you don't look, we'll go ahead and collect and pass out magazines," (Prabhupāda laughs) He will say, "All right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Please close your eyes. (everyone laughs) Let us do something." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> (back in car) ...register as a travel agent so that we can get discount on all of our tickets, airplane tickets, and then also we can work on arranging that, that these tours would stop there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Cox and Kings, they inquired from me, "Whether you can take charge?" Guru dāsa can take charge of this. He is well acquainted with the several places. And he is loitering here and there doing as he likes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...had the plan to perhaps get one bus and leave it at our place and then do tours on our own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...airport by this way? No, the other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You can go this way. We usually go on the freeway. You can go straight up this street. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...freely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Everyone is afraid now, of taking it. The crime rate has become very high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Black and white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Negroes are envious of the white men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. In Detroit every year one out of every five hundred people is murdered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> White man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> White men and black men. Usually black men are murdering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the reason? The same feeling as in India, Hindu Muslim. But it is not so strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No. (end)</div>
