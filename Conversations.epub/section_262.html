<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The material energy, it is also coming from Kṛṣṇa. The spiritual en... Kṛṣṇa Himself is spiritual energy. Exactly like that is. This weather is coming from sun but sun is covered. The weather created by sun makes himself covered; not himself covered, it is covering our eyes. Sun is not covered. My eyes are covered. Therefore material means when our consciousness is not developed. That's the meaning. It is somehow or other covered. That is material. Where is our scientist? They... The mistake of the scientist is that they do not accept two energies, the material and spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They accept one energy. We accept also that. But they, defect is they are beginning from the material. That is their method. Just like this weather is beginning from the light and gradually it is becoming dark. So darkest part or the dark part is called material. But the dark is beginning from light, not the light is beginning from dark. That is their method. They are thinking that from matter, consciousness is coming. Now consciousness is there. When it is covered, degraded, that is unconsciousness. So material means when the consciousness is forgetful of Kṛṣṇa. That is material. Material means gradual development of forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. That is material. And spiritual means full consciousness of Kṛṣṇa. Is it clear? Try to understand this. Darkness is coming from light. Where the light is not visible that is called darkness. This is not the nature of the sun, this covering, cloudy nature. That is not the... The nature of sun is light, but by the energy of the sun another thing is temporary created which is called mist or darkness. This is temporary. This is not permanent nature. Therefore material nature is temporary and spiritual nature is permanent. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to get out of this temporary nature and go to the spiritual nature, permanent nature. Nobody wants also this temporary nature. Nobody likes this cloudy atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The cloudiness is created from the superior energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So material is created from the superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Creator is one. It is always superior. Whatever is created, that is created by Him. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am the creator of everything." So bad or good, everything. Bad and good, that is your creation. Kṛṣṇa's creation everything good. God is good. What you think bad, for God is good. Therefore we cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. He's doing something. In our consciousness it is bad, but we do not know that for him there is no such thing as good and bad. That we do not know. Kṛṣṇa is marrying 16,000 wives, somebody's criticizing, "Oh, He's so much fond of women." But we do not see the other side. He has got the power to expand Himself into 16,000 forms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If this mist of material nature is temporary, then why bother to disentangle oneself from something transitory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you take covering? Does man walk naked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you take covering? You know everything will be cleared after few hours. Why do you cover?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It is dangerous now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, why do you take this step to avoid this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> It's uncomfortable. It's not natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the Māyāvāda theory; that everything will uncover automatically, why do you bother? That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They will not be able to be so philosophical in their next lives when they're a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The Māyāvādīs will not be able to be so philosophical in their next lives when they're dogs or cats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They have to have a human body in order to enjoy that philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their philosophy is that there is only one-God. So cats and dogs, that is God's <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> That is their rascal philo... God is making pastimes, <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> by becoming a dog. That is their rascal philosophy. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> Vivekananda's philosophy. Nārāyaṇa has become <span class="Italic">daridra,</span> poor. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (pause) So with chemists we have no quarrel if they begin from light. They're beginning from darkness. That is our contention. We say, "Begin from light." And they say, "No, begin from darkness." Because they're in darkness. One who is in the darkness, from darkness, if he goes to light, he thinks that the darkness is the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In comparison, they always compare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no comparison. It is practical. Suppose you have been in the darkness for millions of years and when you come to the light you think that "Oh, from darkness the light has come." Light, when it becomes dimmed, that is darkness. Not that (from) darkness, light has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> Darkness cannot exist without light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Or in the light there is no darkness. When the light is dimmed that is darkness. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa consciousness is dimmed, that is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> It's very wet. (referring to the ground)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. After awaken, when one becomes tired he comes to sleep. Or the life, when it is somehow or other disturbed, sleepless comes. When at night we sleep and get up in the morning, it is not that from sleeping condition this life condition has come. I slept some reason or I was in life condition, but I slept, again I am coming to life. That is their philosophy. Just like a child, baby comes from the womb of the mother. From the day he comes out of the womb, if he thinks, "Now, from this day my life has begun." That is not the fact. He's eternal, but he was constructing his body within the womb of the mother, therefore he was unconscious. Now, as soon as the body is finished, he comes out and again comes to consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> And again falls asleep at death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Once he comes to awareness and again he's unconscious. Just like this flower, it has come to now consciousness. Again it will dry and die but the seeds again will grow. Again it will dry. This is material life. And spiritual life means flower only. That's all. (pause) I have got some nice shirt buttons somebody has given me. I shall never put on shirt, neither our students. I think we shall sell it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Buttons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is called? Button, is it not button? Shirt-fixing? Collar-fixing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is it a pin or something like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, like that...gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Not cuff links. No those are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aha, cuffles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">jaya.</span> Do you like I buy from you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I give you my soul for the cuff links?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you take it and sell it. (pause) [break] The last four days this students are not clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Man's best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Because he has no knowledge who is the best friend. According to the quality, friend is selected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> And one is known by the company he keeps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kāranaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> The best friend will lead him to take birth in that family. He'll help him next birth because he'll always think of dog, so next birth, dog. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvam [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> At the time of death, if you are attached to something then you'll think of it, and next birth is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if one's life is achieved by one's consciousness, how is it one cannot remember one's previous life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you remember everything what you did last year or yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No, I don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is your nature. You forget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something there is possibility of. Something..., somebody forgets more, somebody forgets little. But the forgetfulness is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's the platform of material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like stealing. Somebody's pick-pocket. Somebody's dacoit. The stealing is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When we sleep, when we dream, are we carried away by the three subtle elements, mind, intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are carried always by nature under different conditions. You're simply being carried by the nature. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are under the grip of material nature. Just like pulling the ear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> By our desires we are pulled?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You desire. There it is. That's how. It is not willingly because you are willing desires against Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore she's giving chance, "Come on here. Take stool. Become hog. You wanted to eat stool. Come on." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This also shows the eternal nature of the spirit soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is not eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because I'm conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore your consciousness is being revived. Come to the standard of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you'll be happy. That is our business. His consciousness is being misled by so many ways. Therefore we are trying to give him the standard consciousness, "Come to this point, you'll be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How to prove that the soul is eternal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the first lesson. You do not understand? You are a child, now you're a grown up boy. Where is your childhood? Where is that body? Ha? The dead body does not exist but you are existing. That means you're eternal. Body has changed, but you have not changed. Circumstances have changed, but you have not changed. This is the proof of (indistinct). What do you want more? You may remember that I did yesterday these things, today I remember yesterday's activities, but your body of yesterday is not this body. Do you admit or not? As a scientist, the body has changed already. He cannot say that 1973, twelfth May yesterday. He cannot say. It is already changed. But you remember everything of yesterday. That is eternity. The body has changed, but you remember everything. Therefore you are eternal, body's not eternal. This is the proof. Simple proof, even a child can understand. But they'll not understand. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They want some more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that more? It is a simple fact. Just like yesterday, day before yesterday, day before that we saw that stool. We therefore criticize. You are seeing for the last three days the stool, it is not cleansed. But day before yesterday's body, yesterday's body is not this body. And my body has changed, but I remember. Therefore I'm eternal. This is the proof. Eternity means I'm so... my body's changing, but I'm not changing. Just like, I'm old man. I sometimes think, "Oh, I was jumping like this and now I cannot jump." So my body has changed. But I want to jump. But I cannot do it. So that jumping propensity is my eternal propensity. But due to this body, I cannot do it. This is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They would say that, according to their observations, that nature of eternity only lasts one body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness because, as this body... That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> As this body's changing in my experience, similarly, there's another change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, actually, they're able to observe this change, but they can't observe that change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot observe, your rascal eyes are so imperfect, you cannot observe so many things. That does not mean science. Why don't you admit your imperfectional senses? You first of all admit the imperfectional senses. You cannot see. You cannot experience. That, does it mean that is science? So many dogs they cannot understand what is the law of nature. Does it mean that nature does not exist? Why do you think your sense are perfect? First of all, admit that you're the most imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They'll admit that, but they say the way of becoming perfect is through objective information and experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Way of becoming perfect is different. You cannot become perfect by your imperfect thinking. How you can become perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Another question, Prabhupāda, that could be raised is that "If the soul is eternal and passes through one body after another, how is not possible that it accepts, let's say, three, four, five bodies and then dies?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are accepting millions of bodies and then die. That you do not know. I say that your body of yesterday is not of this body. So, similarly, if we live for one hundred years, how many bodies you are changing every moment? Just calculate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Thirteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha? Thirteen? Why thirteen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Every seven years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, every seven years. I say every second. Every second the blood corpuscles are changing. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you're chang... As soon as the blood corpuscle changes, you change your body. You do not know the science. So how many millions of birth you are changing even this experience?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That is their stumbling block. They say they want to be able to observe everything with their imperfect senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is their folly, foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In the scientific terminology the eternality of the soul can be compared with the conservation of energy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of conservation. It is energy. It is always existing. If you say that is conservation of energy then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No. The definition of the conservation of energy is the energy cannot be created nor destroyed. That means that it is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, that we admit. Original energy of Kṛṣṇa, that is existing with Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa is eternal. Therefore all His energies are eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> So the living entity is also eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the sun. Sun, the energy heat and light. If sun is eternal, heat and light (are) eternal. Hmm. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say energy cannot be created or destroyed, then life cannot be created or destroyed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We say that. Life is eternal. It is not created nor destroyed. It is covered only for the time. Just like, I'm eternal, but last night I was covered by dreaming, sleeping. So I say "yesterday" and "today." This is my position. I'm eternal, but because last night I was covered by dreaming, therefore I say "yesterday" and "today."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if material nature is the absence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then where is material? I've heard you say that once before...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no material. Yes? If you continue Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there's nothing material. Just like when we offer this flower in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is it material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You still can accept anything material? No. So how it becomes? It was material in the tree and it becomes spiritual? No. It is spiritual. So long I was thinking it is meant for my enjoyment that is material. As soon as I take it for Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment, it is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So, actually this entire world is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we want, that engage everything in Kṛṣṇa's service. This will be spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So we can also appreciate Kṛṣṇa's creation in that light? For example, this is very beautiful because it is Kṛṣṇa's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We realize that. We don't say... Just like Māyāvādī philosophy says <span class="Italic">mithyā. Jagan mithyā.</span> "This world is false." We don't say that. We don't say <span class="Italic">"jagan mithyā."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This material nature is just one energy of Kṛṣṇa acting in a certain way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I say...? Kṛṣṇa has created so many nice things for His enjoyment, why shall I say, <span class="Italic">"mithyā.</span>" Suppose if you create nice house, very good apartment and you call me, "Just see." And if I say, "It is all <span class="Italic">mithyā."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's also an offense. Because I can't enjoy it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Then how much depressed you'll be. Let's say I brought this friend and this rascal is saying, "This is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Sour grapes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explained that <span class="Italic">asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te, jagad āhur anīśvaram [Bg. 16.8].</span> These rascals, these demons they say like that, that this is <span class="Italic">asatya,</span> this is untruth. There is no cause. There is no <span class="Italic">īśvara.</span> This is the demoniac declaration. If Kṛṣṇa is fact, His creation is fact. His energy is fact. Why shall I say false? We don't say it is false. The Māyāvādīs say it is false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> If someone looks at the Deity of Kṛṣṇa and thinks it's only stone or wood, for him it's still material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his ignorance. How it can be material? The stone is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. Just like electricity energy is there everywhere. The electrician knows how to utilize it, how to take electricity. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, even in the stone. The devotees know how to utilize stone to appreciate Kṛṣṇa. The devotees know. The rascal, they do not know. Because the devotee has no other view than Kṛṣṇa. Why stone should be without Kṛṣṇa? Here is Kṛṣṇa. That is real oneness. And the Māyāvādī philosopher they say oneness, but divide. This is stone, this is not Kṛṣṇa. Why second? Why you bring another thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Good and bad, evil and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is it so for a Kṛṣṇa conscious man that Kṛṣṇa is as much in the stone as in the Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just as much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But we order <span class="Italic">mūrtis</span> all the way from India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated that, "Everything is in Me but I'm not there." This is <span class="Italic">acintya-bheda... mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā, mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is Kṛṣṇa but you cannot worship this bench as Kṛṣṇa. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Worship me in this way."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) Just like the sunshine. That is also sun. Is it not? But you cannot say when the sunshine is in the room, you cannot say, "The sun is my room." This is called <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Acintya bheda...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acintya-bhedābheda,</span> simultaneously one and different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But still you said one can see Kṛṣṇa within the stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> And one can worship Him within the stone or within everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We worship everything. We worship everything, see Kṛṣṇa everywhere. We don't see the tree. We see Kṛṣṇa's energy. Therefore the tree's also worshipable because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's energy both are worshipable. Therefore we say Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare means Kṛṣṇa's energy. We worship everything. In our childhood we are taught by our parents, if there is small grain and if it is strut (?) on the feet, we shall pick it up and touch on the forehead. We are taught like this, how to see everything in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. We cannot therefore see anything wasted, anything misused. Why you are preaching? Why we are after so many rascals? That his life is being misused. Let us give him some enlightenment. This is our mission. Or let him go to hell. Just like Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they're engaged in meditation or in the Himalayas, but we have come to Los Angeles. Why? This is our mission. Oh, these things, these people are being misused under <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> let him gain some enlightenment. This is our mission. We are teaching that, how to utilize everything for Kṛṣṇa. How to understand Kṛṣṇa in everything. That is our mission. See Kṛṣṇa in everything. <span class="Italic">Yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra.</span> Everything is there in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> why don't you read? <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati, yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra,</span> "Anyone who sees Me everywhere and <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati...</span> and everything in Me, he's perfect."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Prabhupāda, we should return to the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. <span class="Italic">Yo māṁ paśyati...</span> (pause) The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are thinking, "Everything for me." The <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> they are thinking, "Why shall I be implicated in this material things?" And we say that there is nothing material. Dovetail everything with Kṛṣṇa. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate, sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate</span> [Bg. 14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Anyone who is engaged in devotional service, he's immediately promoted to the transcendental platform, <span class="Italic">brahma.</span>" He becomes <span class="Italic">brahma.</span> Now, somebody may say, "Oh, we see he has got the same body, how he has become <span class="Italic">brahma?</span>" And how Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, he has already become <span class="Italic">brahma.</span>" How to adjust?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Like the flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same thing. Yes. As soon as everything is understood in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]</span> stage. That is liberated stage. Everything is created by Kṛṣṇa. Everything is meant for Kṛṣṇa. Everything should be engaged for Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness life. That is perfect life. Somebody asked me, "Why you have come to this country?" It is not your country. I've not come to your country, I've come to Kṛṣṇa's country. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We are trespassing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why shall I come to your country. I've come to Kṛṣṇa's country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śukadeva:</span> Prabhupāda, there are many impersonalists in Seattle. We have many universities and I'd like to go there and try and defeat them. But sometimes I forget, I cannot remember the scriptures, so what would be the best clue to always defeat them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if you understand the philosophy without scripture, you can convince them. You can give so many examples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The weather is getting worse, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It will get worse when you leave, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I will... It will get better, as soon as I go away. (devotees sigh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will get..., that is natural. It will not stay. But I'm not going out for this weather, don't misunderstand me. My physicians asked me, therefore... I'm accustomed to this... (end)</div>
