<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> ...city council representative from our area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> (indistinct) to come today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Thank you. No, I have the pleasure of having the temple located in the area which I represent on the city council, and I've found the temple to be a welcome addition to the city. I have no questions. There are formalities which have to be met in order for the temple to be repaired. And I'm sure that as soon as these formalities are met then the work can proceed, but er...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are the formalities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> There's been some delay in the approval on the building due to different building violations and we have to receive approval from the zoning board of appeals, then the city council. And it's a matter of time. But also there has been some opposition in the city council, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what can I do? What is the difficulty? What do you want from us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Really nothing. The only problem is that there are certain rules and regulations that all the citizens of Evanston must comply with. And that's all that has been asked to be done. Originally, as I expressed, there were some... This property, the temple, is located in an area which is zoned for business. And there were some originally who wished to maintain that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there are so many churches...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Yes, there are many churches, yes. And I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the fault if there is a temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Well, I think the... Originally, again I say, some of the no..., not I, but some had some objections to any church, any temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But already there are churches. I have seen so many churches surrounding our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> But I think that that is no longer a problem with the zoning. I think they accept the temple because they have seen that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The churches are not problem? Only the temple is problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> No, I don't think that's the situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, what is the situation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Well, I cannot read the minds of those who objected. Again I was not an objector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are the head. You should judge. If the churches are not objectionable, why the temple should be objectionable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> May I explain? I am one of eighteen who make the decision. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, decision, you may speak on our behalf, but if there are so many churches what is the fault of one temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Again I have spoken in favor of the temple. I think that there were a number that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you plead like that, that there are so many churches, why our temple is the only objectionable? What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Well, I have no objection. I can't say for the others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not. Why they have objection? If they can allow so many churches, so what is the temple has done? We are praying God. We have got Deity worship. What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Nothing, nothing is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What is your answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They say that we are weird. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Weird?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Weird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Strange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Strange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> Yes, in dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is there any law that if the dress is strange we cannot worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They want... They have a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they may want whimsically, but is there any law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> It shouldn't be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what can I do? If they go out of law, then what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They want to make their own law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Again, I think the problem now will be complying with the building laws in order to get the temple in safe condition. That's the only problem now. I don't think that there is opposition to the temple <span class="Italic">per se.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is... It comes to the conclusion of suppression, that "Give the dog a bad name and hang it." "You are not properly dressed; therefore you should stop it." It is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> We have spoken very sincerely to the other aldermen and Mr. Winfield practically is the only one who has responded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So public vote. Elect Nixon and then drag him down. This is public opinion. Sometimes make him president, sometimes drag him down. So what is the value of these votes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Well, I can certainly pledge that wherever I find and can identify prejudices...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they become unreasonable, whimsical, then who can defend? There is no such law that one should have a particular dress in their church or temple. There is no such law. But they are insisting about the dress. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> Again, I will pledge that whenever I can expose such prejudices on the parts of my fellow aldermen, I will do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is very kind of you, but if they are persistent on majority vote, then you are nowhere. So the majority, if they want whimsically to do something, you cannot check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> No, but I can talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can talk. We are also talking, but they don't care. This is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They are making it difficult, Śrīla Prabhupāda, but it seems that they will not be able to check us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we shall have to go to court if they do something whimsically. You speak to your best, that's all. That is our request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">City Counselor:</span> That I will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on everywhere, whimsically. Everything is being done whimsically. Again it is being reformed whimsically, again being the same. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> chewing the chewed, that's all, no standard. That is the fault of the modern civilization. You make your own standard, I make my own standard, he makes his own standard. And therefore there is fight between the leaders. But according to our Vedic conception there is one standard. We are persisting that "You take this Vedic standard; then you will be perfect." And if you go on manufacturing your own standard, you will never be perfect. Because you make your own standard, I make my own standard, he makes his own standard and there is fight. We are putting therefore the one standard, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> That is our propaganda, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you take the standard given by Kṛṣṇa, you will be happy. That is our propaganda. (end)</div>
