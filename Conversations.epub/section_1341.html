<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lay down? (pause) Then I calculated what it would mean for the whole year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we have to open temple in every village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Temples in every village?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then spend money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And then spend the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't keep money. Spend it. The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they spend for sense gratification. You spend for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, there's plenty of money to spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We also have plenty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, <span class="Italic">karmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I understand. I said there's no shortage of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa's giving us... I figured out, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if we... Just like we did in September, I multiplied times twelve to see how much money in a year your books are selling. And the BBT, in one year, can expect to make, around the world, about $8,100,000. In rupees that comes out to seven <span class="Italic">crores,</span> seventy thousand rupees. Seven <span class="Italic">crores,</span> seventy thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What <span class="Italic">karmī</span> can earn so much!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What <span class="Italic">karmī</span> can earn so much. For the temples, that means that by selling your books, the temples will collect about sixteen million dollars in one year. Or in other words, fourteen <span class="Italic">crores,</span> nine <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> forty thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, believe it or not, it's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fact, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually I don't think these men like Bajaj or any of them could possibly make this much money even in material activities, what to speak of spiritual. Spiritual, they lose money. They have to support it. But we have such a genuine religious movement that it supports itself. We don't require to construct big materialistic enterprises. We simply preach, and Kṛṣṇa supplies all the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Bajaj is just burdening the world with motorcycles, and you're providing the highest subject matter for hearing and chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where there is need of money, send there. I mean to say, just like Africa and other backwards... I am simply dreaming, and you are actually on the field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are actually what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> On the field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but that's because we're in your dreams. If you weren't dreaming like this, we would be on the material field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> It's like Mahā-Viṣṇu is lying down. The whole material world is being expanded by His dreaming. So you're lying down here, and the whole ISKCON activities are being expanded by your dreaming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (chuckles) (pause) Do you want to hear some of the newsletter? It says here... This newsletter is written by Rāmeśvara. It's especially meant for encouraging book distribution, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It says, "Later on in the morning, Prabhupāda sent for Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Prabhu and explained to him that he wanted to print as many books as possible. 'My point is,' Śrīla Prabhupāda said, 'that I don't wish to keep money in the bank. Invest in printing.' So in this way, although... Then Prabhupāda went on, referring to Harikeśa Swami, after he presented six new hardbound German books to His Divine Grace, 'He is very intelligent boy. My Guru Mahārāja is so pleased. He used to say whatever money is there was to be used for printing books. He was so happy to print books. So you do it all very nicely. I printed my books, and now you do it. These are first class and there is no defect. German printing is very favorable. This is all right. Thank you very much.' It says here, 'Harikeśa Swami told Prabhupāda that now he has to become more healthy to finish the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> Prabhupāda replied, 'Healthy? I have nothing to do with this body. I have to do with the spiritual world.' Bhagavān <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> mentioned to Prabhupāda how many books his zone was distributing. They are trying for twenty thousand big books in one week. Prabhupāda was very encouraged and told him, 'Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī will give them all blessings. He wanted this very much.' An hour later Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja was in the room and told Prabhupāda that they had printed 100,000 copies of <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book in Portuguese. Prabhupāda said, 'Thank you very much. Printing of books is our life force.' Prabhupāda looked through the books and again he asked, 'How many published?' When he heard 100,000, 'Oh, how they are selling, and what is the price? Very good collection? Print more books. This is life. This material body-only bones. So go on and this is life. We are not concerned with bones and stones. Our concern is the living force. The living force is actually sustaining these bones. Bones are not life. Print books as I have shown the way: half again for printing and half spent for propaganda as you like. In this way go on.' Then he turned to Jayapatākā Mahārāja and asked him if he was doing that. He told him, 'Whatever propaganda is needed, you go out and spend, but print books and distribute. Whatever English books we have got, if we translate into Bengali, you have got enough stock.' Jayapatākā Swami replied 'Yes, we have got a treasure house,' and Prabhupāda said, 'In this way, in all languages, distribute. Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.' " It says here, "Prabhupāda is translating the Third Volume of the Tenth Canto, and Volume Two is now just being printed and will be available for shipping to all temples on November llth along with a new book written by Śrīla Prabhupāda called the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Kapiladeva.</span> Fifty thousand copies of each volume have been published."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty copies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says here, "This is the year of Europe," Śrīla Prabhupāda. It says here, "Here are the totals for book distribution in North America." And Europe is leading. The number one zone is Bhagavān Prabhu's. Number two zone is Jayatīrtha Prabhu's, England. And the number four zone is Harikeśa's zone. So Europe is leading the distribution. Maybe sometime later on today you can do a little translating, Śrīla Prabhupāda. No? Actually the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> recommended that you shouldn't do that for a few days. Does that sound right? Okay. Anyway, I think Pradyumna and Jayādvaita have some work to catch up with, so they have enough to stay busy. Should we chant <span class="Italic">japa</span> now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well they were very stubborn. They simply insisted that there were two paths, and they were quoting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. I said, "Well, that may be so, but of the two paths, your path is the most difficult, and you've called the conference to spread <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> so why are you spreading the most difficult path of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Why not spread the most easiest?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did they reply to that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> At that point Mr. Bajaj interrupted and said that we shouldn't discuss <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> but just how to promote <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and how to cooperate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> While they are busy discussing, we are busy doing it. We have not had any trouble distributing the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās.</span> Even though we have not attended their meetings, the distribution is going on very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Practical application is more important than theoretical knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That also they don't have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Mr. Nārāyaṇa recognized that about our Society, that we are applying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. He said, "I see from very early morning hours you are applying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span>" because he attended the <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was very impressed. He is naturally a devotee, Gujarati. He's naturally a Kṛṣṇa devotee. He can appreciate the importance of <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That man from that <span class="Italic">āśrama...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Aurobindo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Auroville. He was poisonous, very poisonous. Mr. Bajaj wanted to conduct the proceedings in English just so that I would be able to understand, because I was sitting as your representative, but that man refused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, he just spoke in Hindi, and he said something in Hindi to Mr. Bajaj that "I want to speak in Hindi," and he continued speaking in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All artificial platform, surface. "Hindu, Indian, Hindi."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He was very envious, that Auroville, of what is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They're nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are nothing. No one ever heard of them outside of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo never preached in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughs) He was speaking in English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You should have said that. "Why don't you follow your master? He spoke in English." That would have been a good point. You could say, "We are following our spiritual master. He speaks in English. Why don't you do the same?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wrote all books in English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And who can understand those books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You remember I brought to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that book I was studying in college when I first came to you. I brought one of Aurobindo's books, <span class="Italic">Message of Gītā.</span> And you asked me to open the book and read one page. So I read the entire page out loud to you. Then you asked me to close the book. Then you said, "Now repeat what you have just read." And I couldn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You once described Aurobindo's writing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, giving the example of your childhood friend from school. He had to take the examination. So because he... Instead of writing normally, he made up so many big words, and the professors thought, "Oh, he's very intelligent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (speaks some made-up words)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did you hear that, what Prabhupāda just said, Jayādvaita?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You didn't follow the Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> I couldn't hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's very important. If you can't understand it, it means it's important. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They make up a language. Aurobindo has done like that. His writings are simply so many long words that no one can understand. Therefore they think, "Oh, he's very intelligent. Important philosophy." Your books are so simple and nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that even little children take pleasure in hearing <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book and find no difficulty in understanding. And the biggest scholars, they are also praising. These are your books. I found that Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa was not so envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the others were too much. He's not envious. He actually appreciated. He's very eager to come to Māyāpura, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> During our festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He wants to... Especially he said, "I want to come when all of the devotees are there." He's actually appreciating, just like that Mr. Ganatra. He also appreciates very much. Mr. Bajaj is thinking to make a tour around the world of all of our centers. Actually what they have been trying to do for thirty, forty, fifty years, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you have done here in India in the last six or seven years. They don't have one such temple as Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma Mandir, and you have created hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja was telling his father that "You can have conferences all you like, but still you can't understand Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like to hear Tenth Canto, Volume Two, Śrīla Prabhupāda, a little bit? Or more of Kapiladeva? Kapiladeva would be nice. Ten, two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Any book. You know, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was thinking, I'm going to write Rāmeśvara that we should have in Los Angeles a Bhaktivedanta Swami Library with all of your books, many volumes of each book in all the languages. Each different bookshelf will be different languages. Some part of the library will be Spanish publications, German, Dutch, Swedish, Russian, different languages of Europe, Indian languages. And then we'll also have a part of the library for archives. At least one or two copies of every single edition of all of the books. All the previous <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads</span>, as many as we have even from your original ones published in India. In this way make a Bhaktivedanta Swami Library. People can come and read your books. No matter who they are, what language they speak, there should be at least one library like this. Reading rooms we can have all over the world, and we should have some library also like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They have that for all... Like great presidents of America, they all have a library, memorial library, where all their letters, all their papers, everything is kept. Truman has it, Kennedy has it, Johnson had it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That microfilm is there also, Yadubara has it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said that we should always keep you surrounded. We should never leave you alone and always keep you surrounded. So Ātreya Ṛṣi told everyone that, so all the temples, they're going to be sending some devotees to be with you each month. So I think fifty, sixty devotees every month will be with you. So I was wondering if when they come, sometimes they're here, if they chant softly, is it all right if they are in the room? If they chant softly, then even when you feel like resting you'll be able to rest. Because they have come... They'll be coming from five, ten thousand miles to see you. So that'll be very pleasing if they can be with you a few hours each day and chant quietly. Would that be all right? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Resting. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kapoor:</span> Can hardly speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Resting is good in this case. Best thing. Maybe I can read some nice news, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Would you like that? This is a very nice report, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from Peru. Dr. Kapoor said anyone would fall in love with it at first sight. (laughter) Pañca ought to see the Tenth Canto. This is a new edition of Tenth Canto that has just come out. You'll find some illustrations at the very beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kapoor:</span> I think you have excelled all other publishers in this art. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are Spanish publications. We were just reading. These are the books that they were distributing, that they were talking about, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book in Spanish, three parts. There's also some Spanish nectar that came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> It's in the other room, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kapoor:</span> Which other languages have you translated Prabhupāda's books in? French?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, there's I think twenty-seven languages. French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kapoor:</span> Oh. All the books are translated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Gradually, one by one. This is Dvārakeśa. He's in charge of the translating department for East Europe. Which languages do you translate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dvārakeśa:</span> Russian and Hungarian. And others translate into Yugoslavian and Polish, Czechoslovakian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has preached in some of those countries already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Now <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in Arabic also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Arabic, Chinese, Japanese. Twenty-seven languages altogether. One by one, they're being translated. Some are doing... Of course, the German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, these are the main languages. And Hindi. These books are going quicker in translation. Shall I finish reading this report, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kapoor:</span> It's a miracle what is happening, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's another report, from Africa. Should I read it? It says, "The <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement in the dark continent." This was written by Jalakāra and Śyāmalāl. Śyāmalāl is a Bengali devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You may remember him from Calcutta? He's gone to Africa to preach, and he and this other boy Jalakāra travel together all over Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday... No, yesterday some prominent men, Dalmiya. Who came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dalmiya was here, Rāma-Kṛṣṇa Bajaj, Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa, and some gentleman from Auroville Society was here to see you. I think they were participating in that conference, <span class="Italic">Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kapoor:</span> I was also invited. I'm sorry I couldn't come because my wife was very ill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dr. Kapoor could not attend. His wife was very ill, he said. He couldn't attend the conference. Śrīla Prabhupāda, maybe you should rest now a little bit. Okay. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Would you like to take some nice pomegranate juice? Very good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Any difficulties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is a gradual recovery, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We can't expect suddenly that overnight there will be recovery. I feel finally that we've understood a little bit what has been the difficulty. I really think this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has had a little understanding like that. And I think that this Ayurvedic medicine can effect a gradual change for the better. Let us try. We're trying now. We're patient, and if you'll be patient also, then I think we'll see a good change. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Do you feel better, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Little more strength?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, the strength is not supposed to come yet. You shouldn't expect strength yet, because strength can't come unless you eat. There's no reason for him to feel strong, because he isn't eating yet. The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> explained that in order for Prabhupāda to eat, first of all the liver and the kidneys have to be properly healed. Then automatically there will be appetite. If there's appetite, then Prabhupāda will eat. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali) Gaura-govinda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> It's okay. Bhāgavata has arrived. Bhāgavata has arrived, so I came to have <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> We have been to Jagannātha Purī, and some<span class="Italic"> jagannātha-prasāda</span> we have brought for you. Will you take some?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) What work he gives? (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Now we'll begin construction. Our architect-engineer, Samjata, was there. He was making plans, but unfortunately he passed away the last 23rd. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> He suffered from fever. He had some fever, high fever. So he fell unconscious. The doctor came and gave some medicine. The fever was checked, but he gave some high-power medicines that affected his brain, and so he couldn't speak. He just collapsed and stayed still. We came to the hospital that night. Doctor tried his best. He gave saline and oxygen. He stayed the whole night, but at the daybreak he passed away, when the morning came, just on the morning, 23rd morning. It was <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> day. That day he passed away. The day Bhāgavata reached. The very moment Bhāgavata reached there, he passed away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Doctor gives treatment, not reliable. They make experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali about <span class="Italic">jagannātha-prasāda</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not... <span class="Italic">Kono...</span> Give me some taste. I lost taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (offers <span class="Italic">miśri-jala</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> It is Bhaktivikāśa Mahāyogī Mahārāja at Bhadrak who has donated that <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> at Bhadrak? We have started new center? He has come with me to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Where is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivikāśa Mahārāja, <span class="Italic">daṇḍavat.</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhaktivikāśa:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) What is the position of Bhadrak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Bhadrak, there are three devotees now, Ātma-tattva, Kṛṣṇadāsa and Rohiṇī-nandana, and they were preaching and making some members. Bhadrak is a good place for preaching. And I also come there. Just on the 1st November, there was a festival that on that day Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived there when He was going from Jagannātha Purī to Vṛndāvana. They observe that festival. So they have invited us to speak in that meeting on that day. Bhāgavata and I came. There was a great festival and we do <span class="Italic">nagara-saṅkīrtana</span> in the evening. In the meeting Bhāgavata spoke and then I spoke. This was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Yes, people are coming. In Bhadrak they have eight acres of land there. It's cultivated land. If we can manage ourselves, then that will be nice. Now this Mahārāja has given it to other agents. They'll take half and give the half. Nobody was there to look after it. So if we look after it now personally, and take it up ourselves, then it will be managed nicely. And there are two cows also, it has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The arrangement is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> It requires a little modification. We made some constructions there for <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> There is one Deity room, that is <span class="Italic">pakka</span> house, and one more... [break] (whispering) ...Anantadeva and Dr. Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I've been writing them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Yes, they have written letters to Prabhupāda. (whispering)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can talk out loud. You can talk now. You said Anantadeva and Śyāmasundara dāsa Brahmacārī, they were dealing with the <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pāṇḍās.</span> So recently Śyāmasundara Brahmacārī wrote me a letter to come to make <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> if I went there. He made proposal that we start <span class="Italic">nirjok sevā(?)</span> there at the Jagannātha temple, Anantadeva's proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirjok sevā?</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirjok sevā</span> means we'll purchase a fireplace, chimney, and also a little cooking. And we'll give him rice, <span class="Italic">ḍāl, sabji,</span> cooking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and that would be offered to Jagannātha, Lord Jagannātha. Then they would use the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They would distribute it or... That is <span class="Italic">nirjok sevā.</span> That <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> has appealed like that, "Do this thing." Then they will recognize us, and get permission to enter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who will get permission?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> There is a committee there. It is <span class="Italic">pāṇḍā's</span> committee and temple management committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But who will be allowed to enter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> That will be passed in that committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but they will allow Western people to enter Jagannātha temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Yes, yes. They have talked with that Anantadeva, but they want money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They want <span class="Italic">nirjok sevā</span> or they also want money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> By giving us permission, <span class="Italic">nirjok sevā,</span> means indirectly they want money. They'll take money. Then they'll give us permission to do <span class="Italic">nirjok sevā</span> and also, that way, entrance into the Jagannātha temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. So how much money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> I talked with that Śyāmasundara and Anantadeva. He said thirty-six groups are there, <span class="Italic">nirjoks, pāṇḍā</span> groups. And administrator is there. They want something and all groups want something. (whispering) One <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees to see Jagannātha. But we can see Jagannātha in any temple in the world. Why do we have to pay one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees? Śrīla Prabhupāda? I was saying that we don't have to pay one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees to see Lord Jagannātha in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them pray to Jagannātha for my cure immediately, or as soon as possible, I shall do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If they pray to Lord Jagannātha for your cure...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Immediately or as soon as possible, then he'll do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. First they should do the praying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let me be in health. Then I'll do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you understand? Prabhupāda says that the answer is that first of all they should pray to Kṛṣṇa for Prabhupāda's cure, pray to Jagannātha for Prabhupāda's cure immediately, for his health. And then, when he is physically fit, then he will do the needful. But first of all, by their prayers to Jagannātha, they should make him physically fit. Is that right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who did you have talk with, Anantadeva or Śyāmasundara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Anantadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is Anantadeva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda said, "Who is Anantadeva?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Anantadeva... They have written letters to you, from that Śyāmasundara Brahmacārī and Anantadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But Anantadeva is connected with which group?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> He is a disciple of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's disciple of Bhaktisiddhānta or Bhaktisiddhānta's disciple's disciple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> No, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gaura-govinda Mahārāja says he is your Godbrother, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There's thirty-six <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Thirty-six groups <span class="Italic">nirjoks.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirjok?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...moment I am sick. When I am well enough, I shall do something. Hm? Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's a very proper answer. So in order for you to be able to do something, they should pray to Jagannātha. Śrīla Prabhupāda? Girirāja is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is your health?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, I'm better, improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the news of Nepal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, well, they have a very nice program there. They have a nice house with many rooms, and the Nepalese people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many rooms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> About nine big rooms. And they do street <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> every day in the main street, and they distribute literature. And the Society is not yet registered there, but I went with Prabhaviṣṇu to a lawyer, and we've set up the formalities for getting registered, but the government is presently reviewing the registration law, so it might take a few weeks before they accept our case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the whole, it is favorable. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, yes. There is a tremendous scope. And the royal family is very powerful. They run the whole country, and, of course, they're Hindus. So I also went with Prabhaviṣṇu to meet one relation of the Queen Mother, and this lady was very enthusiastic about our activities. So I discussed with Prabhaviṣṇu the strategy how to approach the royal family, and... It's a Hindu state. They don't claim to be secular, like in India, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, it is hopeful. Then he has one local boy who has joined, Nepali, and he's a very nice boy. I mean, there's so much field for preaching. There's the royal family, then there's membership for the business community, and there's <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> and book distribution for the general people, and then also there are many hippies there. So we could recruit devotees from amongst them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The hippies seem to be still our best customers, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The hippies seem to be still very good customers. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That's because Prabhupāda's <span class="Italic">patita-pāvana.</span> And the temple atmosphere is nice. It's mainly <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> There are no women there, so very good atmosphere. They have a nice program. They have a love feast program, and many people are coming. I think they can have two or three hundred people coming very soon. And the people are very simple and good natured. Everywhere we went, people would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They recognized the devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. And they're not envious. It seems that in India many of the people are a little envious of us, but everywhere we went in Nepal, it seemed that the people were very happy to see us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Have you ever been there, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You'd like to go sometime?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. We'll include that on our world <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Actually, the relation of the Queen's mother whom we met, she was also asking about people coming who could give good lectures and enthuse everyone. So I said that you yourself would probably like to come when you're feeling better. So she was really wild about that idea. I'm sure that they would give you a real royal welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good field it sounds like, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> What about the language? Is there problem with language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No. The educated people speak English. In all the schools they teach English, so all the youngsters speak English in Kathmandu. And then most people in Kathmandu, even if they don't speak English, they speak Hindi. And there are just a few who only speak Nepali. But Prabhaviṣṇu has arranged for <span class="Italic">The Perfection of Yoga</span> to be translated into Nepali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He sounds like he's doing very good, Prabhaviṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Good man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's very good. So he's eager to get that in print. Then they'll be able to distribute literature to everyone without exception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Do you remember when Prabhaviṣṇu was here you told him to go with "the courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother"? He remembers those words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the word of a great poet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Girirāja's parents took him there, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and they made another offer to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? (Tamāla Kṛṣṇa laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, no, they... My father has increased the fortune, so he was trying to tempt me again, but I wasn't interested. But I think in the end he may give in to Kṛṣṇa, because we were in... We were helping Prabhaviṣṇu by giving him dollars, and he would give us rupees. So we were in a shop, and my mother was making a check, which she was giving to me to give to Prabhaviṣṇu. So the owner of the shop thought that the check was for him, and he started making some objections. So my father said, "No. In our system the husband gives to the wife, and the wife gives to the son, and the son gives to Kṛṣṇa." (laughter) So everyone laughed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just try to manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I had a very nice dream last night in which Your Divine Grace appeared. And you were walking around the premises of the Vṛndāvana temple, and there were some doll exhibits. So you were saying that they should improve the quality of the exhibits, because this is their <span class="Italic">sādhana.</span> So I felt that you were, actually, you were telling me that I should improve the quality of my service and that this was my <span class="Italic">sādhana,</span> but to be, you know, polite, instead of saying it directly, you were pointing out to their service. And then you started to speak very directly and very boldly, and you were saying... You quoted the verse,</div>
<div class="Verse">yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br class="calibre2"/>āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">And you were saying, "This is my order, so you do it for me." I mean, I felt that you were saying that since it was your order and we were doing it for you, even though it's very difficult, but it would be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, there is a beginning in Nepal. Try to implement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? When you took <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> today did you find a little taste? Not yet. Did you have any avocado?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was little tasteful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. You've been thinking about having that for a long time. You talked about it on and off before. Avocado is said to be very good, nutritious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the rent of the house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The rent? It's about twelve hundred rupees, but that's less than one thousand Indian rupees, and it's right on the way to the Paśu-pati-nātha temple, which is the biggest temple in Nepal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Very famous temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You've heard of it, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. People go there to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How is it on the way? Directly on the way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There's a crossroads which all the traffic passes to go to that temple, and our temple is about just a few hundred yards from that crossroads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We could put a sign on the road. We have a whole building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. It's a bungalow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. In a compound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. In the compound they're growing flowers and vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. How many acres?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, it's about half an acre, but whatever land they have, they're using.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have a lease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I don't know if they have a lease, but the owner of the house is a Vaiṣṇava, and he's very... Actually his house is next door, and his house is called Viṣṇu-nivāsa. And when he built the second house, he wanted it to be used as a temple, and he called it Bhagavān-nivāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he's very pleased with the use of the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many members they've made there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, he's only made two members. I think he's going to get into it a little more. He doesn't have to be registered to make members, because the two members he made... Tax exemption has to be... Each case is considered individually. There's no system, but the lawyer and other people I spoke to felt that, since it was a Hindu state, and since they wanted to encourage such activities, that they would give us tax exemption. There's even a community of Marwari businessmen. So Prabhaviṣṇu had made one or two members by giving receipts from Calcutta, since we're not registered. So I suggested that he should concentrate on the Marwaris for the time being, and he can give receipts from Calcutta, and that would be good practice, because they are the most willing to become members. And then, by the time he got registered, he could start approaching the Nepali businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How will the Calcutta receipt help them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, I don't think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They care much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No. Just to give them something official. He has seven boys there now, and a few of them ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are taking their <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and living there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. They have nice meal in the morning and evening, and then in the day the main activity is they have the chanting party, and around the chanting party they distribute literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very nice beginning, all-auspicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Is the weather very cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> It's not very cold. The climate is very healthful. In fact, two devotees were there who were in India for some time and they felt a little weary, and they both said that they felt that their health and strength had increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> It's a beautiful city also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. It's very peaceful and clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sounds like a good place to take you sometime, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The air is very, very pure. They hardly have any industry there, and very few motorcars. It's very unspoiled. So the air is clean and the people are also nice. Until a few years ago, there was no system of compulsory education, so the new ideas, Western ideas, have not come very much there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like a little soft chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you haven't passed urine in some time. Would you like to try?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No need. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want him to chant again? Should he chant some more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. I think the reason that you haven't been having much <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> the last two or three days is because Haṁsadūta and Bharadvāja were not here. Isn't that it? Their <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is very sweet. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Ratha-yātrā ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> At Ratha-yātrā Jagannātha came very late for Pāṇḍu-vijaya. It was first time announced that it would take place at nine, but actually it took place at four p.m.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> We heard that this year that new body... Jagannātha has a new body, so it was heard that that was not proper time. These <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> and some people were interested with this business purpose. They did so, and also these <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> were doing some nonsense inside the temple, so Jagannātha was very much displeased, so it took so much time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> untimely changed the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Untimely they changed. And it was the custom that King Purī-rāja, the king of Purī, would do <span class="Italic">cara-paraha,</span>(?) this cleaning. But they ill-treated the Purī-rāja. There was some incident previously. So Purī-rāja was not present at that time. He left Purī, and he was somewhere else. So <span class="Italic">cara-paraha</span>(?) was being done by this <span class="Italic">baḍa pāṇḍā, pūjā-pāṇḍā.</span> Such mismanagement was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who was <span class="Italic">baḍa pāṇḍā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> There was one <span class="Italic">baḍa pāṇḍā.</span> I don't know his name. One who does offerings.(?) He is chief of those <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās.</span> And then, when this pulling of car... That took place just a few minutes before sunset. It was the custom that as soon as the sun set, there will be no pulling. Only Balarāma's car was pulled a few yards, dashed against a (indistinct), and four of the wheels were broken. So then it stopped. For two days there was no pulling unless it is repaired. Then for two days car stopped there. So on the third day it was pulled. The cars were pulled to the Guṇḍicā. Such things happened this year. And we were the only party who chanted before ra<span class="Italic">tha</span> from ten to four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only party means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> We. Lokanātha Swami's party had arrived, and we are at Bhuvaneśvara, four, five devotees. We were there two days before at Purī, and we went there and we chanted and did <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> before the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> from ten to four. There were much crowd this year, so much crowd that this whole <span class="Italic">baḍa danda</span>(?) was filled. And above, the top of the roofs, the buildings, were all overfilled. The government people that were broadcasting of radio, they all took photos and also they recorded our <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> They announced in the radio also. This incident took place this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We did not have these problems at our Ratha-yātrā, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> The crowds stayed for the third day, or they all left?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> No, they left. Third day there was a thin crowd. They all left. That was the only day when all had come. They left. Fifty percent, seventy-five percent crowd left. Only twenty-five percent stayed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Was there any criticism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Oh, many criticisms. Many criticisms. I also heard. There was one custom that there are some specific persons, <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās,</span> they would go out all directions to search that wood, specific <span class="Italic">nim</span> wood from which the new body would be carved. There are some symptoms in the wood, that <span class="Italic">nim</span> tree. They would find it out. And they go all directions. But this year they never gone anywhere. Last time from where they have pulled up the trees, they went there, and without proper ceremony they cut down the trees and came. This was also criticism. They never followed this thing this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> are doing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Doing all nonsense. These <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> are so wicked that all were afraid of them. These government people are all afraid of them. The administrator, temple administration, though he's government servant, they are all afraid of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> Because they are <span class="Italic">guṇḍās.</span> And these government people, they get vote and come to the power, and these <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās,</span> they are so powerful that if they will not listen to them, they will topple down their position. They have such apprehension. And publicly also they will create some persecution among them. They have such... That Sadasiva Rath Sharma?(?) That time, Prabhupāda, when you were at Bhuvaneśvara, he came...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, ha, ha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> He was telling that when he associated with us, those <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> told him that "Oh, you have taken some money from these ISKCON people. Therefore you are favoring them." He was criticized, and he was telling me that "Now these <span class="Italic">pāṇḍās</span> are talking about me like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's also a <span class="Italic">pāṇḍā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaura-govinda:</span> No, he's not a <span class="Italic">pāṇḍā.</span> He's one of these <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> of that Mukti-maṇḍapa <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> He's president. This time, while we were talking with Anantadeva, we said that "Sadasiva Rath Sharma(?) is favoring us, and he gives favorable opinion." Anantadeva said, "No, don't believe him. He's a rascal. He's the most greedy person. He wants much more money." Anantadeva gave this opinion about him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They arranged that special lift to take you out of the plane also. Remember when we went in the plane on British Airways from London?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Last night I had a dream, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Everyone at Māyāpura, all the devotees, were rolling on the ground and flailing their fists on the ground and pulling their hair and weeping. They were all expecting Your Divine Grace to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think you have to fulfill their prayer, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> There's also some news from Māyāpura. Seventeen of the Muhammadans, those Muslims, they have been arrested. Now they're released on bail, but they were officially arrested in Māyāpura. And also Jayapatākā Mahārāja says that the site where they are thinking of building that big temple in Māyāpura, some land has just become available for sale, about fifteen <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land. And it ranges from fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred rupees per <span class="Italic">bighā.</span> So Jayapatākā wanted me to tell Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Fifteen <span class="Italic">bighās,</span> that's five acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why not purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Right where the, where we want to put the temple. It must be a group of men that the prices vary per <span class="Italic">bighā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why not purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Jayapatākā Mahārāja is very anxious to purchase that land. It's exactly where the site for the big temple, at that location. Fifteen <span class="Italic">bighās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether he can purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whether he can purchase? If you don't go to Māyāpura, Śrīla Prabhupāda, all of Māyāpura will come here to be with you. Now, if you get a little stronger, we can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Even the airport officials were disappointed. They were saying, "Where is our Guru Mahārāja?" I was shocked to hear them saying. "Where is our Guru Mahārāja?" They had purchased very nice fruits and vegetables of all different varieties, and Prabhupāda could choose which he liked-<span class="Italic">portal, jinga,</span> so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What other news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What other news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Everything is very nice there, very organized. Jayapatākā Mahārāja and Bhavānanda Mahārāja have organized it very nicely. Calcutta is very clean. Also Calcutta was prepared in case your Divine Grace was feeling tired. Then you could have stayed at Calcutta for a day or so and then gone on to Māyāpura. Many life members had come to the airport. Sita Ram Daga...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think we have to go soon, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Actually, to take you to different places is the greatest ecstasy, because there's no greater pleasure the devotees have than when you first arrive, they see you. Their feelings know no bounds. Airport arrivals have always been ecstatic over the years, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The newspapers always remark how ecstatic they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the condition of the road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This road is hopeless. We have to find an alternate way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> How about going from Mathurā to Delhi by train?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning you were asking for Bharadvāja? Here he is. We thought of a better way to go, Śrīla Prabhupāda, than car. We'll take the Taj Express from Mathurā to Delhi. It's quite a nice train ride. It takes only one hour and forty-five minutes, and it doesn't even stop one time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> I just took it from Delhi this morning. Very clean, very smooth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We will have one devotee get on in Agra to reserve a compartment for us, and then we'll board it here in Mathurā, and it arrives in Delhi at about nine-thirty at night, nine forty-five. So then we'll spend the night in Delhi, resting, and then the following morning we'll take the morning flight to Calcutta and Māyāpura. This means also that you won't have to undergo any strenuous journey to Delhi and then immediately take a flight. The train journey is actually much easier than a car journey, and then we get the whole night to rest, which is also good. So basically it just means we take a plane and then the car ride to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I simply go by car from here to Mathurā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Then we take the Taj Express, which is nonstop to Delhi, then stay in the Delhi temple, which is also nice, overnight, and then we proceed on to Calcutta. The next morning we leave on the plane at six-thirty in the morning and we arrive in Calcutta by about eight-thirty, and we should arrive in Māyāpura by noon. Does it sound like a good plan? Now you simply should gain more and more strength, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This time, until the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> comes, from now until then, you should rest as much as possible, take these medicines. I think it's having a positive effect. You mentioned this morning that when you sit up you feel a little stronger now. I think it's good that you're not taxing yourself in any way. That's important. Would you like to do something specific right now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What shall I do? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, Upendra's saying you might like to wash now your face and teeth. When does Prabhupāda wash his body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Two, approximately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the afternoon. Maybe I should read some news to you? What would you like to do now, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> News?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I might have a little bit of news. I'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Māyāpura I shall stay in my quarter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. Everything is very nicely arranged. There's one nice, big bed, this same size, with nice, soft mattress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why another bed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> The other bed is still there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> The other bed, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is not wide enough. [break] ...very high. We find for moving you about on the bed, sitting you up and turning you on your side, that it's safer and more convenient if we're able to get up on the bed itself. So the bed that you had at Māyāpura was single bed. It wasn't very wide. This will be much more comfortable for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long it takes to go to Mathurā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From here to Mathurā? It would take about twenty minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean, within one hour of leaving here you'd be on your way to Delhi on the train. Another thing is that that Taj Express is very much on time. It's never late because it only stops one time between Agra and Delhi, and that's here in Mathurā. It's a very, very exacting train. So we can arrive fifteen minutes before the train is expected to arrive. We don't have to arrive hours before, or anything like that. It's... We'll also make a special arrangement with the train stationmaster that only when he sees that Your Divine Grace is settled comfortably in the train will the train proceed onwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You got one letter, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from the BBT Library Party in America. I won't read it all, but just to sum it up... That <span class="Italic">Readings in Vedic Literature</span> by Satsvarūpa Mahārāja, that book, remember, that I read some parts of to you? <span class="Italic">Readings in Vedic Literature</span> Satsvarūpa wrote? It's a short book? That book is becoming very much accepted in university courses. Many, many classes are using it as a textbook, which means that automatically thirty to fifty copies are purchased at a time. And all over the country now, as the Library Party travels, at each college one or two courses use this book now each semester. It's a regular textbook now. Now that they've introduced the study guide to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they expect the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> will also become a regular textbook more and more. Actually this is a... The Library Party reports that this is a great future for these books, is that gradually all of these books will be accepted as textbooks, and they will be made mandatory reading in college courses, which means there will be huge sales year after year. Another thing which they're beginning to sell very widely, Śrīla Prabhupāda... See, first the Library Party went to every university in America over the last four years and sold standing orders of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Now they're going back this year and starting to sell textbooks, text orders. They've done standing orders, now they're going to the same colleges and they're approaching the professors and saying, "Here's a book for your class as a textbook," which means that the teacher orders thirty copies at a time. So they're beginning to do this now. And they're also beginning to sell the movies. Yadubara's movies are being taken. In each school one or two people are renting these films or purchasing these films as well as slide shows. This is called audio-visual media. The Library Party is starting to sell a lot of the movies and the slide shows as well as tape cassettes. Music courses, for example, want to order tape cassettes of Your Divine Grace singing <span class="Italic">bhajanas</span> and playing the harmonium as part of a course in Indian music, for example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many of you are going to Māyāpura with me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are going, ten-ten on the plane and another four or five on the train. Say fifteen altogether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Even more. There was about four or five on the plane that Prabhupāda didn't take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now, of course, there are more devotees who are coming, just like Citsukhānanda Prabhu and others, so they'll also be going. By the time we go, we may be able to rent a third of the plane or something. At least there will be twenty or twenty-five devotees maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> And then they have big caravan arranged, so from the airport or from Calcutta temple to Māyāpura there will be at least forty devotees going with Your Divine Grace to Māyāpura-the devotees who go and the devotees who greet you there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you like that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That we go in big numbers like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Then at Māyāpura there will be at least 150 devotees to greet you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Running down the road? (laughter) Śrīla Prabhupāda, shall I continue with this report? Another thing that's beginning to happen is that the professors, after getting your standing orders and after teaching with your books in their courses, they are starting to become very friendly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For example here is one example cited. He says, it says here, that "Daśaratha Prabhu went straight to the chairman of philosophy who happens to teach in that field, and that chairman also bought a copy of <span class="Italic">Monograph 2</span>..." which is Svarūpa Dāmodara's science books; these are also becoming important, "...and promised to review it. During this time, Śeṣa was meeting with Fritz Blackwell, an Asian language specialist who has used <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book in his course as a textbook and has known devotees for four years. Fritz's exchanges with Śeṣa were so intriguing that we shall simply list them one by one. The two passed in the hallway, not knowing each other, but later, when they met, Mr. Blackwell said, 'Oh, I knew you must have been with ISKCON. No one else would be so nicely dressed.' Śeṣa had corresponded with Mr. Blackwell previously and sent him copies of 'The Hare Kṛṣṇa People' and 'Spiritual Frontier' movies to review for a special national survey of audio-visual materials on new spiritual movements. Fritz related that ISKCON's response was the quickest among his many suppliers for the project, and when he told his wife the Hare Kṛṣṇas were the first to send their films, she simply replied, 'They would be.' Śeṣa acquired advance copies of Mr. Blackwell's reviews on the two films, which we'll enclose with this report if possible. Introducing Mr. Blackwell to the <span class="Italic">Readings in Vedic Literature</span> prompted him to say, 'I will definitely use this in my course next year.' He also agreed to send a review by December. Fritz told Śeṣa, 'It's amazing that you've come today. We're just going to start our study of Kṛṣṇa tomorrow. Can you come and speak in my class?' Śeṣa immediately complied. Fritz introduced him as an authority and personal colleague, so the students listened attentively and took notes. Śeṣa used slides to supplement his academic glorification of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Interested, the students asked many questions such as 'Why is Kṛṣṇa blue? What is <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span>' Fritz was very pleased with the whole thing and gladly helped Śeṣa make arrangements to get another <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> standing order in the library." They already had one order, and they got another order. "On the same campus, Śeṣa sold a preview order..." Anyway, then they sold some more books. That's just an example of the way professors are beginning to be more and more helpful, and they're actually becoming devoted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They've been very much impressed with the Library Party. The Library Party devotees come in suits with ties. They look very proper. They're scholarly. The books are the most prestigious, scholarly presentations of the philosophy available. And these people, they first ordered the standing order. Now they're ordering course textbooks. And now they're starting to teach your books in the courses, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They're preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness right in the classrooms. So automatically, when the see the devotees, they are very much attracted and friendly with our devotees. They want to take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So the scholars, who are the most intellectual community in America, are becoming devoted now to Your Divine Grace and this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I read this letter? It's from Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have read already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that was Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa. This is Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa, from New Zealand. He says, "Dear Śrīla Prabhupāda..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you gave me that milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> This morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Quarter past eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now it's about 10:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, every two hours give me something. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> That's nice program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Little, little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Next I'll give you some barley and milk. Would you like to have some <span class="Italic">bati chachury(?),</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? <span class="Italic">Bati chachury?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe some fried <span class="Italic">portal</span> too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, fried <span class="Italic">portal</span> also. Would you like to have some <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi</span> with that, Śrīla Prabhupāda? <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭi? </span>Or some rice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) I'll not be able to take. Better not bother. This fruit juice or milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, better to take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe there's some way, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that the <span class="Italic">portal</span> can be made into a texture that you can easily accept. Once you have to chew it, it's difficult for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> I can do one thing-cut the <span class="Italic">portal</span> in small pieces and let it boil for say hour or two, so all the juice will come out. It will be some kind of a soup.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Portal</span> soup.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Make it in a way that Prabhupāda can take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, there won't be any solid thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's good. I think liquids are easier for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> also said that, that for now, liquids are best. That will be nice. Avocados you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Next we'll give you at 12:30, so after two hours we'll give you some barley water, barley milk and some avocado, like yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda. <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I go on reading, Śrīla Prabhupāda? He says that book distribution is doubling there also. He says, "On the farm we are doing spring planting, and this year seven acres is being put into crops, an increase over last year, since the population has grown. The farm is now famous throughout the country as..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you give me some rest, I can sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we give Prabhupāda some rest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Some pillows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Back rest. [break] "...with your permission we would like to come and visit you sometime later this year, as it has now been so long since I have had your personal association." Do you give him permission to come visit you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says, "I am a fallen wretch, but I am hoping and praying to the best of my capacity that your health will improve." [break] Would you like Bharadvāja to sing a little?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can sing now. [break] The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will be coming back to take us there. Better that we follow his advice and let this medicine work a little while, see if you get some strength, and let him come and take us there as he promised he would do. There is no reason why we should jump ahead. As we have placed ourself under a competent <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> better we take his advice as long as we don't find it to be harmful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When we expect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We expect him to come the day after Diwali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there is Diwali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Diwali is the 10th or 11th. I think the Marwari community, they celebrate on the 10th. So we expect him on the 11th or by the latest the 12th, which means one week from today. Do you mind waiting that long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was thinking if we have to go, why...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, because he's also said that he will give you some medicine for helping you to take the trip easily. No reason to rush, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Our original reason for delaying was to give you time to get a little more strength. That <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> felt pretty confident that if we wait this long, you will get some more strength. I think we should wait. Everyone is feeling that way. You're not unhappy here, are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You look very peaceful, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] He was not talking, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Without your blessings, how can I get compassion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And without your blessings, how could we distribute so many? We directly see the proof of that verse, that the more the <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva</span> saw that these fruits of love of God were distributed, the more they relished. We find in distributing your books that the more we distribute your books, the more blissful we feel. This book distribution is actually a part of our daily lives, just like... It is one of the regulative principles practically. Chant sixteen rounds, follow the four regulative principles, and distribute Prabhupāda's books. Everyone sometime in the day does some book distribution or helps in some way the book distribution. [break] ...distribution has begun, the devotees enjoy it so much that they even like to do book distribution more than the life membership. The ecstasy of approaching people, person by person, simply on the friendship of your books is the highest of all pleasures. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far I am thinking, I'm not improving in strength. And how can I improve by drinking little barley and milk and little fruit juice? I have no appetite for anything else. In case I... Most probably, I am diminishing my strength. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Most probably diminish your strength?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How? I don't see that you're diminishing in your strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I cannot sit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you haven't been able to sit for a long time. You mean you cannot sit up now even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In that also, I am diminished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a fact. Now when you try and sit up, you always fall over to the side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in case... "In case," no. From the fact I can see that I have no appetite. Then how I can increase strength?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I can only repeat the words of the <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He states that you can't expect to eat as long as the liver and the kidneys are not functioning properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not functioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he says that he can get it to function properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">He</span> says, but I practically see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But his medicine cannot... He also says that his medicine cannot be judged over a period of five or six days. He's not claiming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean in case I do not increase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right. Okay. In case you don't increase. Because I don't think we can say... Unless we want to say that this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is absolutely wrong. But if we accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say wrong or right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I agree with that. So we have to say, "in case." So what is your point, Śrīla Prabhupāda? That in case you don't gain strength...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Than what I will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, why don't we decide that when the time comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why don't we cross that hurdle when the time comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, no, because we're still saying "in case."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Because I don't feel appetite for anything except that little one sip barley and one sip juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But again the point is that the whole idea of this medicine is that it takes time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practically I have seen that it is not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you're not allowing sufficient time, according to the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What time? I could not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he says fifteen days. He said fifteen days. He said a minimum of fifteen days. It's been about six days, five days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, in case it is not successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why don't we wait for that "in case."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are waiting, but in case. (Tamāla Kṛṣṇa laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the <span class="Italic">Āyurveda</span> doctor was telling that one great factor is your willpower. That's very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am losing my willpower, because practically I see that I am becoming more and more weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said you're losing your willpower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Don't you think there has been a slight improvement, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Over last few days there has been a little improvement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that improvement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the improvement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Your intake has increased. Your voice sounds stronger than before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) What you will do with the voice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That's a sign of strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why don't you consider. In case it is not successful... <span class="Italic">Upāyān cintayet prajñā apāyān ca cintayet(?).</span> Two things side by side: success or failure. In case it is failure, then what you'll do? You cannot guarantee anything success. Maybe success, maybe failure. If <span class="Italic">kavirāja's</span> suggestion, if it becomes success, that's very good. But if it is failure...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How can we give a recommendation on this question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, what you will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we will do next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then we will go on. We'll go on trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What trying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well... Go on giving you juice and barley water, <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Maybe eventually the situation will change. How can we stop trying to feed you and take care of you? Kṛṣṇa can intercede at any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, suppose if you want to move me from this place. That is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. We're going to move you if we see some positive improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was the whole reason for waiting, is that you're supposed to get stronger by waiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall wait, but from practical point I cannot drink more than one cup of milk and one cup of fruit juice. That is practically happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, that certainly is the fact right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Each... Right now I am... I am thinking it may not improve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know you are thinking that there will be no improvement, but we are a little hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hopeful, hope against hope-that is natural. But I am becoming hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we are not yet hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the value of your hope? I am the practical man. Then, if it is failure, what you will do? That I am asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> One thing we could do is begin twenty-four-hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all? I am afraid you may put me in the hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Prabhupāda, we're not going to do that. We already said that we would never do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you..., what is called, want to move me, so what arrangement will be made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> What arrangement we have made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Moving is no problem. But we say that we're not going to move you unless you show improvement. But we're not going to put you in the hospital. That is not going to happen. We can always take up the program of twenty-four-hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Massage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And you can fast. That's... But why should we suggest that at this point? It is not proper for us to suggest that. Obviously we could say that, but that's not very... That means hopeless. So we cannot become hopeless. As your disciples, we can't become hopeless. And putting you in the hospital means hopeless. That's sure. Hospital is absolutely useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Neither we would ever go against your instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it's not within our... Śrīla Prabhupāda, we only took you to the hospital in London because Your Divine Grace said we should take you there. Otherwise we were not going to do that on our own. We did not go there on our decision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that starving and chanting and little <span class="Italic">gaṅgā-jala</span> or... In this way let me pass away peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, first of all let us see this treatment out properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> That you can always do. Fasting, that you can always do. But let us see this treatment through. We have hopes in it. And for moving you, what arrangements, that <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has said he will come here and move you personally. But he didn't want to move you for the next fifteen days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no actual strength...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. That's why now we won't move you. But if strength comes, then we can move you. The whole reason for going to Māyāpura, one of the main reasons...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I admit that it will be very nice if I can go to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there should be some strength. So we also say that. So let some strength come. Then we'll move you. And if it doesn't come, then we'll stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So in case things deteriorate, don't move me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. We're moving you on the basis that you get strength. That's why we're waiting this time. We're not fanatical that we have to be in Māyāpura. The basis of being in Māyāpura was that if you show sign of improvement, then changes for good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I shall also be very glad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. So that is the basis for moving you, that there should be some positive strength shown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now there is no strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Śrīla Prabhupāda? Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī has come to see you. Shall we have him come in now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Set up the chair. He'll be coming in a minute or two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get one small light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No Śatadhanya, the one on the right. On the right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, he hasn't come in yet, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa? (Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī chanting <span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> It is wonderful that he is speaking so nicely, with full sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying that it's wonderful that you are in full consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He doesn't expect this consciousness in this condition. Therefore he is astonished. Actually, physically-finished, everything. So wherefrom the voice coming and wherefrom intelligence coming? That he is astonished. (Bengali) [break] So fix up this program, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and whatever little I want to eat, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And you'll continue to take the <span class="Italic">kavirāja's</span> medicines?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I'll go on. What is that? If there is any improvement, welcome. Otherwise there is no question of moving me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. [break] There has to be some actual improvement before you should move. Otherwise you are already here in Vṛndāvana, so why move?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if actually you can show signs of improving and recovering, then there is reason to move for health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Traveling now should only be undertaken for health purposes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is welcome. But at the present moment, I don't see any such... (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why Tamāla Kṛṣṇa gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> I'll get him, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bābājī Mahārāja also I have consulted that "Being afraid, don't move me in the hospital." He also says, "No, don't do."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're not going to do that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That Saṁjāta dāsa? You know Saṁjāta dāsa, the architect from Bhuvaneśvara? He passed away recently. So I asked Gaura-govinda what were the circumstances. So he explained that he had been very ill for four or five days. They took him to the hospital. So the doctors gave some drugs for reducing the fever. But suddenly he died. When he died he was unconscious. Gaura-govinda said maybe it was due to the drugs that caused some severe reaction. We see one example after another that these hospitals, they are simply meant to kill, not to save life. I mean, I don't think we have any faith either in them, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And apart from our faith, which makes no difference, you strictly ordered it. So we're not going to disobey your order under any circumstance, even if we risk our own life. If someone says to us that "We will kill you if you don't let us take your Guru Mahārāja," then we'll say, "Then kill us." Your order is our command.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does he say? They will kill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I said supposing someone threatens us with our life, that "We will kill you if you don't let us take your Guru Mahārāja to the hospital," still, we will not let them take you. Your order is our business to follow, even at the risk of our life. So we are not going to take you to the hospital under any condition. Neither... Not only is it your order, but we also see absolutely no benefit from these hospitals. Your order is sufficient, but apart from that, also, from our own limited intelligence, we also see that the hospitals are condemned. These doctors are blind, these allopathic doctors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my only request, that at the last stage don't torture me and put to death. So I am not eating anything, and if we chant, by batches chant, I'll hear. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.</span> That is the medicine. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the decision, that in case it does not improve, let me die here. If it improves, I shall be very glad to go... (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Improvement hasn't come yet. Simply because you're drinking more, passing more urine, is not the sign of any improvement. (Bengali conversation between Prabhupāda and Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī) (end)</div>
