<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...our shelter is land. [break] ...Juhu? No, only some birds. (several birds are making noises, including a crow) There is crow. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhaktadāsa:</span> We have the ducks and swans over there, and we have the crows here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they are keeping crows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> "Birds of a feather flock together. They are crows so they are keeping crows." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say that "You are crows. You have come to see the crow." (laughter) Will they not say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...bottle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhaktadāsa:</span> This is a office for the zoo. They have a little exhibition of animals and botany. It smells like skunk. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They capture other birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhaktadāsa:</span> Yes, right. They eat mice, and birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> And chickens. They come flying, those chickens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...call gaj pat(?). They eat pigeons also. [break] ...not very clear. Dirty water. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...of the trees in Seva-kuñj.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. [break] ...are exactly Indian. [break] They have good facilities on this lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> They have one church here, Prabhupāda. It is Mormon church. It is not too far from here. It is very gigantic, and it's on a hill. And every Sunday they get maybe five to six thousand guests because they have spent great money on a big complex. They have a library, museum and church. This is... We could also do this sometime, make one nice Indian temple. Thousands of visitors would come, even just tourists, from all over the world. They could probably come the same way. Ours would be much better, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Very good idea. [break] ...also very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The lake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Due to that lake. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...but no one can swim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That big lake in Chicago? No one can swim because of the pollution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they polluted, such a big lake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> By factories. Many factories are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> They empty all their waste directly into the lake. All the fish are dying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here some fishy smell. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...gentleman first has to understand that he's not the body. That psychologist gentleman has to understand he's not the body first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So, what did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yeah, he believes that there is soul and that you're not the body, and he's hoping that he'll be able to become more serious about studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to understand that more clearly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him prove there is soul. That will be great service to the western world, if a scientist and philosopher, psychologist proves that "Here is soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, how should they set out to prove it, though? We've proved it by giving scriptural evidence. But how should a scientist do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we prove it as a living and dead man, we give that proof. What is the difference between this dead man and living man? What is losing? What is missing? This is the proof. If... I so many times spoken that son is crying, "My father is gone, my father." "Where is your father gone? He is lying here. So what is gone? You have not seen it." This is the proof. Why do you cry, "Father is gone"? Father is lying here. Why do you say, "gone"? So that means what is gone, you have never seen it. Now you perceive, "Yes, something was there. Now he is gone." This is the proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So our statements are also backed up by observation. The <span class="Italic">Gītā's</span> statements are also backed up by observation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Science means observation and experiment. That is science. You observe that this man is moving. There is something... (sound of someone calling from a distance) (Prabhupāda calls:) Invite him. You are invited come. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the psychologist is in ecstasy every time he speaks to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. No, he is a good boy. Although I say, "You do not know anything." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He didn't become angry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is good man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He has some humility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> You tell everyone that and they come back for more. (Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So science means observation, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, observation and experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> And experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is science. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> To make an experiment by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Here is experiment, just like the dead man and living man. First of all, you observe that this man is moving or this animal is moving. There is some moving force. And the experiment is when the man and animal is dead, you can understand that the moving force is gone. This is experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your car is here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We can walk further if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> The psychologists feel limited by the particulars means of experimentation that have already been used by other psychologists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What experiments they have made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Well, these particular tests and so on that they're using. So it seems that he ought to change. Because somebody started doing that, right? I mean, they didn't always use those tests. They always change different kinds of tests and everything. Instead of being limited, he should offer a new method of observation, a new method of tests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is simple, but because of their bad education, they cannot understand the simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They want everything complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Complicated. The experiment is there. Observation is there. Everything is there. And the eternity is there. Kṛṣṇa begins like reasonable gentleman, not humbug. He says, <span class="Italic">tathā-dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> very good example, that "As in this, body is changing from this stage to this stage, this stage, this stage, step by step, similarly," <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ,</span> "similarly another body." So where is the difficulty to understand? So if this is accepted, then immediately you can accept that the soul which is changing body, he is eternal. <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate.</span> Therefore he was never born, never died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> When Arjuna came, he was suffering so much distress, but Kṛṣṇa did not give him any psychological test to see what was the matter with him. He immediately knew it was because he was in the bodily conception of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, the thing is that you say that it is life which makes matter move, but the scientists, they don't accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are rascals. How it is moving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say it's a certain combination of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You make it. That means experiment. You simply observe, but you have no experiment. Therefore it is not science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You have to demonstrate knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, demonstrate. You make in the laboratory that things are moving by this combination. Otherwise it is useless. Therefore two things must be there: observation and experiment, practical and theoretical. Theoretical-something is there who is moving. Now you make it practical to see that this combination... Just like they say chemical combination. Now take the chemicals and make experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, the thing is that they are now in the test tube they are making experiment, and they are putting a certain set of chemicals together and maybe some soul takes shelter of those chemicals. But the scientists say that they get the credit for it. They don't say that the soul has entered. They say, "No, we have put different elements together, and now some..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They have never done that successfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And even they are successful, what is credit? So many living entities are coming every minute, and if after thousand years, they can create one ant, so what is the credit? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, now the impersonalists, they will accept that there's something in that body that's different than matter, but they won't admit that that's a person. They say that it's just some type of energy force, or they call it consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we haven't got to hear from them. You take lesson from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> Are they better situated than the person who doesn't accept it at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> The impersonalists that denounce Kṛṣṇa, are they better than the person who is ignorant of eternity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is he ignorant of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The common man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are the impersonalists better than the gross materialists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Śaṅkara's philosophy. <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> That is his philosophy. Brahman means that spirit soul, that is fact. And this material external, that is false. A little advanced than the Buddha philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, how is it that they describe the soul, the impersonalists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have no eyes to see. They say that "The body is finished. Now..." <span class="Italic">Gatākāśa potakāśa.</span> They give the example, just like within the pot there is sky, and outside the pot there is sky and when the pot is broken, the within sky mixes with the outside sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So we say that within the pot, or the body, there is consciousness, and that remains eternally individual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is said by Kṛṣṇa. It is not our imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So the eternal characteristic of the self, then, is that he is pure consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pure consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He knows that "I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa." That is pure consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> And therefore His servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Part and parcel means servant. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Would you like to walk further, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> It's twenty to seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Let us go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's time to go. (end)</div>
