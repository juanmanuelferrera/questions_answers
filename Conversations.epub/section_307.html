<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no spoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Someone's bringing it. Mukunda's bringing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get it. Give me little water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> What? Water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> I wonder if I could ask you first of all to tell me what is the central point of the teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Central point is to understand God. People have become so foolish. They have forgotten to know about God, know about himself, what he is. Everyone is under the impression that "I am this body," which he's not. He's spirit soul. They're so much in ignorance, and there is no education. Even big, big professors. Prof. Kotofsky, in Russia, he told me, "Swamiji, after this body's finished, everything is finished." That is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Can you tell me who is Lord Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Kṛṣṇa is God, the Supreme Personality of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> And what will it profit us if we get to know about Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The profit means you'll be saved from the material existence. Material existence means repetition of birth, death, old age, and disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> How does He speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> How does He speak to you or to us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was present five thousand years ago. He came on this planet and gave instruction, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So that is recorded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Why have you written <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it really is? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As it is, because there are many foolish rascals, they interpret unnecessarily. Just like Kurukṣetra. Kurukṣetra is a place in India, still existing. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> The meaning is clear, that "Kurukṣetra is a religious place and there, the Pāṇḍavas and the Kurus, they assembled together for fighting." But many so-called leaders, political leaders, scholars, they have interpreted, "Kurukṣetra means the body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Can you tell me the chant? Will you recite the chant to me? And then tell me why it's used so often by the followers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> The Krishna chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Center">Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare<br class="calibre2"/>Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This, this is transcendental sound vibration. If you chant, then the foolish ignorance will gradually dissipate. You'll come to real knowledge. You'll be purified. In India still, there are many snake charmers. They, simply by <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> they can get out the poison. Materially, if it is possible, how much it is possible in spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Can you tell me...? There's been an awful lot in these last two years said about the Jesus Movement. How does that sort of line up with Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know what is Jesus Movement. If you can explain, then I can speak. What is that Jesus Movement, I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Well, do you know very much about Jesus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Tell me about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Jesus, the son of God, he's representative of God. So we have got all respect and honor for him. We worship him. But I do not know what is about Jesus Movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Tell me a little bit about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, will you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness means the same, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, which was spoken five thousand years ago by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, we are preaching the same <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa is accepted, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So we are preaching that "Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Is Kṛṣṇa consciousness genuine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we are simply wasting our time, do you think? By preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, do you think we are wasting our time? We are so fools? Why do you ask this nonsense question, "genuine"? Unless it is genuine, why we are working so hard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Why is it so popular among young people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have got knowledge. Young people are receptive. Young people, education is given during youth time, not in old age. Old men cannot take any education. Whatever he has learned, he'll take another period of fifty years to forget that. Therefore sometimes it is called "old fools." But young men, they are receptive, they have got brain. When they understand that "Here is something," they understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (1):</span> Many thanks. I'm very grateful... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span> [break] This gentleman's from the <span class="Italic">Sunday Mirror.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> His newspaper, is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> That's right. Ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">Sunday Mirror,</span> they published, some, something about us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I think you published something about us a few weeks ago, about the manor out at Letchmore Heath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> That's right. Yes. With a lot of pictures. Were you there at the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> You were there at the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> How've you... Where have you been since then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I went to Sweden. I have come yesterday from Sweden. I was in Sweden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Yes, since then? And now your back again for the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now I have come again back to..., yesterday, and again I am going back to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> How long are you going to stay there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Sweden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> In India, when you go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, in India, I shall stay about one week. Then I shall go to Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Do you find, uh, you must find it very, very difficult travelling all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> What don't you like about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What don't you like about travelling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Oh, you like it. Do you always go...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but because I am old man, it is little troublesome for me. Otherwise, I like travelling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> What, what were you doing, what did you do before this, before 1966?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was retired from my family life. I was living in a holy place called Vṛndāvana. I retired from my family life in 1954. Then, in 1959, I took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> order. This is called renounced order of life. No family connection .</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then I started for American in 1965. And then my movement was started from U.S.A in 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> From the U.S.A. Could you tell me why you think the Western world has espoused your sort of movement now, has been keen on looking to the East for spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they, actually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Why is that, do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he can explain. He's Western people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> But I mean, how about in your view?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He wants to hear it from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are getting some substance. You see. Just like here is a sweetmeat. If you have never tasted a sweetmeat before and if you are supplied a nice sweetmeat, naturally you appreciate and take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> But why, why 1966? I mean what was there, what was there, special about the Sixties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And before that, this thing was not administered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> I mean the mood of the time might have been right then. I mean was there something about that age that made it especially attractive to the young people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Young people, even Young boys, they also take. So generally teenagers, they to...Teenagers, they take it very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Why was that? I mean what was there, was there something special about the 1960's that made it more likely that people would go for...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But before that, this movement was not there in the western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> I know that. But there's got to be a mood of the times before something like this can catch on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that, not that time. Any time. This sweetmeat is sweet all the time. It is not that at a particular time it is sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> But people have got to be hungry to eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes, hungry, everyone is hungry. Because in the Western countries, unless they are hungry for spiritual consciousness, why they are hippies? They are frustrated. They are not going to live like their fathers and forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Frustrated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This material civilization, ultimately it will be frustration because... Just like... Try to understand... You are a person. You are covered with this coat and shirt. If I simply take care of your coat and shirt, and if I do not give you something to eat, how long you'll be happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Not very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Do you take this throne with you all the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> No. How, how does it come to be here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We have a temple. So we bring it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> And this is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This is called a <span class="Italic">vyāsāsana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> And for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> A person, it's for a person, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, the spiritual master sits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Nobody ever else sits upon that platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> What happens to it when he's not here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Nobody sits on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> It's still there, but...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> And lastly, a very trivial question. The uniform, the haircut, why is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This shaving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Yes, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice. It makes the head cool, not with big bunch of hair, burden. We feel it burden. When there is bunch of hair, we feel it is an extra burden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> An extra burden on the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Makes it, weighs heavily on the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sometimes you have to take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> So that's the reason why? It makes the mind lighter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Actually if you keep clean yourself, then your mind is also clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> But it is... Is it really because hair presses down on the mind? Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's a burden, troublesome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> I mean a physical burden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Just like you have to get some, some hair cream and then a comb and a mirror and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Well, I don't. I just get up and go like that. But I mean, I mean, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You understand the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Well, I mean. I do and I don't. I mean physically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Very clean, very clean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> ...physically, it makes the hair, it makes the mind lighter. Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Very clean, cool. Natural, practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> No, I know, but I mean, this thing about it actually weighing down on the mind, is that fair to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> It's not fair to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> It is fair to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you keep yourself very clean and light, then your mind will work very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> Better than if it was being weighed down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> That's fair, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's a matter of cleanliness. Not when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> But he also says it's a matter of weighing down on the mind. That's fair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a Vedic system. All the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> take clean-shaved. Vedic system. So we are trying to stay in the platform of brahminical culture. Therefore it is one of the essential things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (2):</span> I understand that. Thank you very much from me for your help. Thank you. Bye, bye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> [break] ...A church. Which church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Methodist Church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Methodist Church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Which is fairly advanced, really...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Methodist Church is famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Methodist Church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I've seen many signboards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah. Do you have some questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Yes, I have. What, what is the real relationship between Kṛṣṇa consciousness and other religions? Is it that God has many names and...? (Someone comes up, introducing someone)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Chuckling:) That's all right. I thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Mr. Bose, representing National Herald.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Maybe you can move this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">ācchā.</span> (Bengali) Now, now, Mr. Bose... Let him come first of all. Give him a chair. Mr. Bose, let him come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> I'll come back later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, three minutes. He's old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Shall I take this away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Bose:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] She's waiting? Then I shall come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Right, well (indistinct) some publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, every religion has got God consciousness. Without God consciousness, there cannot be any religion. But somewhere we find the degrees of consciousness. Just like every living entity has got consciousness. A child has got consciousness, dog has got consciousness, and a human being has got consciousness, but there are degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Do people lose this consciousness, the God...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Do people lose God consciousness as they grow older?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, unless a person comes to God consciousness, his consciousness is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> And the actual importance of the Hare Kṛṣṇa chant, is that in saying the name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Or is it a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...spiritual process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> ...continuous flow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is a spiritual process because Kṛṣṇa and the name Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa the person and Kṛṣṇa the name, They are nondifferent, Absolute. That is the God's special power. Just like in the material world, if you want water, simply by chanting the name "water," you'll not be benefited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in the spiritual world, the name, "water," and the substance water, is the same. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's name is the same. So if you chant Kṛṣṇa, you immediately directly contact with Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> What do you see as being the future of the world? What will happen? Will there be an end?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Future, future of the world, because the people are trained up in the bodily consciousness of life, "I am this body." So so long people will remain in bodily consciousness of life, that is animal life. That is not human life. So they have to be educated to spiritual consciousness of life, that "I am not this body, I am spirit soul." Then they'll be benefited. Otherwise, they'll degrade more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Yes, but what do you see happening to the actual world? Do you see any... You know, with Christianity and other religions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> You know, with Christianity and other religions, the world has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Christianity, if you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> ...a beginning and an end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We also believe that, that the world has a beginning, and it has an end. Anything material. Just like my body, your body. It has got a beginning from the father, mother, and again it will end. So anything material, it has beginning and end. But the, within the body, the spirit soul, the spirit soul has no beginning, no end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> So how long has Kṛṣṇa consciousness been in India, or were you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness is in India from Vedic age, since a very, very long time. But especially since five thousand years ago when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> So you, you didn't start everything off?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. I'm simply presenting in English language. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says that he's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Does he not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is a bogus thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who says that: "I am God," he's a rascal.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter (3):</span> Well, thanks for talking to me.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> I've committed many sins in this lifetime. How may I make peace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says she has committed many sins in this lifetime. How she can make peace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is the only remedy. What you are doing now?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which newspaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">English Boy:</span> I'm not from a newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He said he's not from any newspaper, but he would like your blessings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">English Boy:</span> I do, regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you chant it? Very good. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Call that Jaya Hari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Jaya Hari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jaya Hari, no, Jaya Hari. What is the name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Jaya Hari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jaya Hari, eh? So what has happened to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> I've been working in London, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But when I go to London temple, I don't see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> I've been working for others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I, I, I think there is something wrong. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> Well, you see I've just been very heavily engaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> This reception I've been working on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> I've been working on this reception also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are a good boy. You were doing good book selling. Now you have stopped. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> Well, this reception is one of the points for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> One of the main reasons for having this reception was to help sell the books, also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I no... You cannot forget your duty. If, if there is some extra duty, that does not mean you shall forget your own duty. So now they are selling books. You also join. Yes. And you have no <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> You are just like ordinary boy. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> I don't have time to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is not good. This is not good. You must be as our representative, with <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> as we are dressed. Yes. Don't be deviated. You have got a good opportunity. Don't be deviated by bad association. Yes. You are a good boy. So you must revive to your original position. All right. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> Are you pleased by the reception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jaya Hari:</span> The reception is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The reception, did you like the reception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah yes, nice. So what is your question? You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">English Boy:</span> I'm trying to spread the word at school. I'm telling all my friends about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. That will help you. All right. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> [break] ...actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Professor Gombrich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So you have seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes, I have, yes. You are travelling to India, I hear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> You are setting up a university in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Are you establishing a university in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not so easy thing. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> At Navadvīpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Navadvīpa, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> And, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have begun teaching, but I do not know when it will become a university. That is a big job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> I see, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Who is teaching there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our students. We have got these books. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> You don't have the Bengali <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> teaching Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, at the present moment, we haven't got. They're... Generally, in India, they want to learn English. So, as soon as they learn English, they can read our books. And Sanskrit is also... You have seen? We have given each word meaning, Sanskrit. The pronunciation. Oh yes. Here is the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> So in Navadvīpa, will the instruction be in English or in Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These boys, they do not know Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Oh, I see. So it's literally for English-speaking devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not English-speaking. They are Bengalis, the students. But they want to learn English. Therefore we are teaching English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Is this a government-recognized college now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Government recognition means we have to abide by the orders of government. We cannot teach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> only or <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> But our aim is to teach... We have got another school in Dallas for small children. There we are Sanskrit, teaching Sanskrit and English. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes. But did you yourself study Sanskrit at Vṛndāvana or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We had studied Sanskrit in school, colleges. In our time, Sanskrit was compulsory. In our days. Nowadays, I don't think so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> I, I also had compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sanskrit compulsory and additional there was Sanskrit. So I took both, compulsory and additional.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to my I.A., I regularly studied Sanskrit, and in my B. A., I gave up Sanskrit. I read history. (laughs) No. Not in B.A. B.A., my combination was economics and philosophy. In I.A. I was intermediate, I.A. I had history and Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> That was at Calcutta University?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Calcutta University, Scottish Church's College.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have been in Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you know Scottish Church's College?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> I'm afraid not. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> No, I'm afraid I've only been to Presidency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Presidency?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So the Scottish Churches College is also on the same standard, Presidency College.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are teacher there? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> I teach in Oxford, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You teach in Oxford?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in India went to visit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes, I lived for two years in Ceylon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ceylon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> My speciality is Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A religious student. A specialist in religious, comparative study of religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Well, not so much comparative. I main, I really teach Buddhism itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Through Sanskrit and Pali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pali, yes. Pali is almost Sanskrit language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> It's not so different, yes. Derived from Sanskrit. And at Vṛndāvana you studied at a later time, then, did you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana, I studied the Vedic literature, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> as I mentioned so many, <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads, Vedānta-sūtra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Then that was after the university?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that was after my retirement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in student life I had knowledge in Sanskrit, and that was utilized later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Yes, of course. And do you return to Vṛndāvana often?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Every year I go there, during the month of October.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Do you have a particular <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Yes. Now we are constructing our own temple also, very big temple. You had been in Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> No, I haven't, I'm afraid. No. And do you think that the message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness or Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is very different from the message of realizing God which is promulgated in other religions, for instance the Śaiva religion or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No I don't think so. Any religion, you follow nicely. Just Christian religion, there is God consciousness. So actually it is not this religion or that religion. People have given up religion. All over the world they have no more interest in religion. And especially I see that in your London that so many churches are vacant. Nobody's going there. So thing is that there is no more regular teaching of religious system. It has become a profession like. Neither the teachers are serious, nor the students are serious. So our principle is that not this religion or that religion. Whichever religion you may like, you can follow, but we want to see whether you are God conscious. If you are not God conscious, then we take it simply useless waste of time, these so-called religions. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam.</span> You understand Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Verse">dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>notpādayed yadi ratiṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śrama eva hi kevalam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Śrama eva hi kevalam: "Simply waste of time, laboring." If one does not understand what is God, even after executing very rigorously about his own religious system, if he does not awaken his dormant God consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he has simply wasted time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> But do you think for instance, in this country, if somebody is a Protestant, or I mean a Christian and goes to church, this is also, you don't try to convert them away from that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We have no such process (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Gombrich:</span> Because your movement is extremely distinctive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We don't try to convert. Just like one gentlemen was asking, "Why these ladies, girls, they are putting Indian sari?" I never said that "You do that." But they're doing out of their own accord. So I never canvassed to become a Hindu, or like that, no. Our propaganda is, "Just become God conscious." (end)</div>
