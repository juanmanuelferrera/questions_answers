<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientist, they estimate something that thing is beginning from here, next year that it has changed. [break] ...test atomic bomb on this planet and to test atomic bomb on the sun planet. What is your idea? What is the description of the sun planet according to science?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Scientists say that is burning mass of ah, chemistry, gases. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...atomic bomb there. Huh? (laughter) It is a burning mass of... Suppose it is a burning mass. So what atomic bomb will act there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Atomic bomb normally acts as, ah, what happened is the particles floating in the atmosphere, like chemicals, chemicals, what happened is this explosion offers this, ah, fundamental particles like neutrons, electrons, they bombard further atoms which are already in the atmosphere. So one by one they knock out these smaller particles called electrons. They move very high velocity. There is a very tremendous energy, amount of energy released. So one... So suppose first atomic bomb, ah, the, ah, the energy-bringing substance like electron, neutron, hits another atom, and then it knocks out several of that sort, and then it makes a chain reaction, not stopping because..., and thereby several atoms they will knock each other, one by one, without stopping. Small particles, so much energy has got. But in the sun planet, where it is so hot, it is already probably more powerful that the atomic bomb itself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore this example. (laughs) What it will act, the atomic bomb, in the sun planet? Similarly, Brahmā might have possessed some power, but what is that power in comparison to Kṛṣṇa? Every power is derived from Him; so Brahmā's mystic power cannot act on Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
