<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Money is nothing but paper, but with the paper I can buy food, so then why is it that we say that money is nothing but paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You belong to the cheaters' association. You are cheated, and you cheat others. So the whole world is the association of cheaters and cheated. Because you are cheated, you want to cheat others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sometimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say well, if there is no God, then it doesn't matter what I do. But there is God, and He knows what I am going to do at every moment, then it doesn't matter what I do either. He knows what I am going to do, so what does it matter? I can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but why do you suffer? Why do you suffer? You do anything, that's all right, but why do you suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, it's all God's plan. I suffer according to God's plan, I enjoy according to God's plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, there may be God, but what does it matter what I do? He is controlling everything. What do I have to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are so senseless that you do not understand that you are suffering. That is required, just like cats and dogs, they are suffering, they cannot understand. Your position is like that. So our point is that you are suffering, but if you become obedient to God, you will not suffer, that is our propaganda. But you are so fool, rascal, that you do not know that you are suffering. And still you are denying. God is the master, so if you do something wrong, you must suffer. That you are suffering. And we are preaching, that don't do wrong, be very nice, you will not suffer. This is our propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the devotees, they seem to be suffering too, from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you cannot expect, if you are suffering from some disease, you cannot expect to be cured immediately. But one who is taking the medicine, he is intelligent. His sufferings will be gone. But these rascals, they will not take medicine even. They will continue to suffer. This is the position. Devotees actually do not suffer, but you see that he is suffering. Because you are suffering. Devotees do not suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> What happens to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They enjoy. They enjoy. Hare Kṛṣṇa! How you are dancing always, Hare Kṛṣṇa, unless you are enjoying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Sometimes I get sick stomach too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, because you have got this body. And after giving up this body, completely, blissful life. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are not going to get another body of suffering, that is your advantage. And these rascals, they are going to continue one body after another simply suffering. And for the devotees, although they do not suffer, it is just like, the fan is moving, you make the switch off. It is actually not moving, it is by the last force it is moving, but the switch is off. And it will stop, suffering. But you have no such chance, you will simply go on suffering, moving, moving, moving, <span class="Italic">bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> You shall have to accept one body, suffer, and again give up this body. Another body suffer, because so long as you accept material body, this body or that body, you will have to suffer. Material body means suffering. So those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they will change bodies one after another, and continue to suffer threefold miseries. And devotees, actually they are not suffering, but even if you say they are suffering, so after giving up this body, they are no more accepting material body. They will remain in spiritual body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> A materialist would say that is our faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may be your faith also that you do not believe it. Your faith, wrong faith. And if we are accepting this faith, so if there is chance, so we are getting promotion. But you have no faith, you will continue to suffer. We are at least taking the chance, but you are so foolish, you are not taking the chances. So your suffering will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> In India they say, well, we will take the chance when Kṛṣṇa wishes. Whenever He wishes; His will is everything, that whenever He makes me Kṛṣṇa conscious, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa said that you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> He wishes, why you don't take up His wish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because He is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is everything; therefore ask Him. You do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I am nothing, He is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can speak like rascal (?) (laughter) Why you are speaking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Double-talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why did God arrange for the pleasures of sense gratification if He wants us to go back to home, back to Godhead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, senses are meant for enjoyment. But if you want to enjoy your senses in diseased condition, that is your misfortune. You have to cure your disease, then you will enjoy. Just like the tongue, in diseased condition, even if you are given <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> you will not taste it. Senses, we are not the Māyāvādīs, they finish the senses, make, become impersonal. That is not our program. We want to purify the senses. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Purīfy. The diseased man, he cannot see. He has got some glaucoma disease. Cure it, and he will see very nicely. That is our program. The Māyāvādī program is that if this eye is giving trouble, I cannot see, pluck it out. We are not doing that, we are trying to cure the disease and see. So senses should be cured, and then you will be able to enjoy. That is our program. We are not stopping sense enjoyment; we are trying to give you real sense enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but I see that your devotees, they are working every day, doing so many things. I am also working. Why is it that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are working blindly,... just like monkey, he is busy, but he does no value. You work under our direction, then it will be of value. (Chants <span class="Italic">japa.</span>) <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Senses are not to be abolished. They cannot be. It has to be purified. And then, when the senses are engaged in the service of the proprietor of the senses, then it will be perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So this body is temporary anyway, so aren't these senses temporary also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Senses are there. The dog has senses, you have got also senses. Body may change, the senses will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But when the body is finally finished, aren't the senses also finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Body will have finished when you are liberated. Otherwise, one after another, another body, that's all. Childhood body is finished, you have got another body. But in a childhood body there were senses, and still you have got senses. The body may change, but the senses will continue. Even in the small ant, for sense gratification, they gather as soon as there will be grain of sugar immediately. They have got the same senses. Just like you run after something according to your estimation very big, for them that one grain of sugar is very big. So they are also running after sense gratification. So anybody, <span class="Italic">viṣaya karuṇa sarva dakṣaya,</span> whatever body you may get, the senses will be there, and you'll enjoy, according to your capacity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> If we take the position of an objective observer, and we look at the hog and we see that his standard of happiness is very low...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You become attracted when the hog enjoys senses without any discrimination. You become attracted: "Very nice. Why not get this facility?" That is your fault-you become attracted. Whatever you see, you are so in diseased condition, you become attracted by that. That is your disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> The point that I was trying to establish was that if a hog has a standard of happiness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> ...which he is satisfied with, we also have a standard of happiness which we are satisfied with, as devotees. Could there be... Who is to say there is not a higher standard of happiness, higher than what we think is the ultimate happiness? See, we are thinking that to become liberated from this material body and go back to home is the highest happiness, and we are feeling this is our standard of happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Because the happiness which you are enjoying these are not actually satisfying. You are not actually satisfied, therefore you want transfer of happiness from this field to that field. That means you are not actually happy. Otherwise, why these rascals they are enjoining the same vagina at home and why they go to see vagina in the theater? The vagina is there, but they think that to see vagina at home is not so good, but to see vagina on the stage is better. That is all. Disappointment. You'll see the same vagina, here and there. You'll go there by purchasing ticket. That is your misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> But the devotee is <span class="Italic">ātmārāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All these Paris big men, they go to see the vagina at night, purchasing ticket fifty dollars. All big, big men. In Paris there are so many clubs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The Lido.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Lido is the leading nightclub in Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (All start laughing.) Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, no, I have not been there. I don't know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well you know such clubs are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I know the clubs are there. I used to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's said. And that is much. These rascals are chewing the chewed. One thing one has chewed, and throwing it, and again another person trying to chew it-if there is any mellow, if there is any sweetness. This is going on. Just like our Indian leaders, they are going to chewing the chewed. They are seeing the effect of material civilization in the Western countries, and they are going to imitate it, thinking that they will be happy with that. They are giving up their own culture, and they are going to accept another culture which is already failed (?) <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ.

But the business is the same: <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Either at home or in the club or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why is India not satisfied with its own culture? If the Westerners are now going after the spiritual culture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because your forefathers came from England and taught them like this. That is the real fact. India was satisfied, but the Lord Macauley, they said no, that if you keep Indian as Indian, you'll never be able to rule lower down. Cultural conquerer. So they began to teach Indians England's work in India. "Whatever you have got, that is all nonsense. You learn from us." And the first product is Jawaharlal Nehru. This is the misfortune of foreign rule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> It would seem then that English culture is stronger than Indian culture then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> It seems that the English culture has conquered over the Indian culture then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Indian culture is still going on. It is not lost. Otherwise how it is going to your country and bringing you? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ravīndra-svarūpa:</span> A person might argue that the Indians weren't satisfied either; otherwise they wouldn't have taken up the English culture. So what's the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. When you are standing on two boats you'll never be satisfied. It is very dangerous position, you know? Two boats, on the river, and if you put one leg here, one leg here, it is always troublesome. Either you give up this or give up that. Then your position will be safe. But India's position is like that. Two boats, he is standing, and he is troubled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The English taught devotional service to England. The English were teaching devotional service to England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because the Indian people, they have such a feeling for <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and service. Everywhere in the world we go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the Englishmen never took that line and when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did they teach God consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When our godbrother Acyuta Mahārāja and Bon Mahārāja was sent, Lady Willingdon, he derided them that "You Indian people you come here..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...say that Western civilization is very good for the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but they cannot teach their own children. They are becoming hippies. That is the effect of their education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> You have to judge by the fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You cannot teach your own people, and you are going to teach others. "Physician heal thyself." Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Greets someone.) You have failed to teach your own children, they are disappointed, and you are going to teach others. This is another cheating. It is not the question of... That is another fault-"our," "your." There is no question of "our," "your." Any culture, actually if it is culture, it is meant for the whole human society. Why do you say, "our," "your." We never say, "The Kṛṣṇa consciousness is meant for Indians," or "for the Europeans." It is meant for everyone. That is our proposition. You have made this "our," "your," and bring another controversy. That is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is meant both for the Indians and the Westerners. That is the fact. When Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> "You have to change your body," Kṛṣṇa never meant that it is meant for the Indians. It is meant for everyone. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ. Dehāntara-prāptiḥ</span> is not meant that Indians only change and they become vanished, European. <span class="Italic">Dehāntara-prāptiḥ</span> is everyone. So try to understand this philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> will say that materialistic culture is also meant for the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we admit. The materialistic culture, how to eat nicely, that is meant for everyone. Everyone wants to eat nicely, not that only Europeans want, not the Indians. That is material. To sleep nicely in a good apartment, that is wanted by both the Easterners and Westerners. So there is no discrimination. Sex life, that is meant for everyone. So as material life is also meant for everyone, similarly, spiritual life is also meant for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> So there are only two cultures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The <span class="Italic">deva</span> culture and <span class="Italic">asura</span> culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So the human form of life, one should take advantage of the spiritual culture because in other forms of life it is not possible. This is the main thing. You become Indian or American, it doesn't matter. You are human being. Take to this culture and you will be happy. This is our mission. We want to make everyone happy. <span class="Italic">Sarve sukhino bhavantu:</span> "Everyone be happy"-with Kṛṣṇa. That is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that the children in the West, in the materialistic culture, they become hippies. They'll say that at least they've had the choice, at least they were given...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again, again you are bringing the same question, Eastern-Western.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Materialistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Materialistic means that is the ultimate end of materialistic life. Because they want new pleasure, new pleasure, new pleasure, so sometimes this, sometimes that... Sometimes they think the civilized way is better; sometimes the uncivilized way is better. That's all, this way and that way. That is called <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś ca...</span> And then you'll take again to civilized way of... I think some of the hippies are taking now. Yes. Because the same example, stool, this side or that side, it is stool. So these materialistic persons, they are trying to change from this side to that side, but it is stool. That is the... That they do not know. They are accepting stool as something very sublime, and therefore they are trying to change the position, sometimes this side, sometimes that side. <span class="Italic">Hitvā anyathā rūpam.</span> This is <span class="Italic">anyathā rūpam,</span> means a living being. Being spiritual, his business is spiritual, but he has accepted material as the platform of his happiness. That is his fault. So material thing, either this side or that side, it is material. <span class="Italic">Bhoga-tyāga.</span> So therefore he is not happy. And we are trying to give him spiritual platform for happiness. That is real happiness. But he is so much attached to the material happiness that he cannot believe that there can be any happiness beyond this range. That is his ignorance, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Therefore we call them <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> rascals. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, "When you become spiritually realized, then <span class="Italic">prasannātmā,</span> happiness." Otherwise it is not possible. Material thing, you take this side or that side-there is no question of happiness. When you become <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> spiritually realized, then there is happiness, <span class="Italic">prasannātmā,</span> immediately. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But should this be forced on people if they don't want it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If a large section of the people don't want spiritual life, that's their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you cannot force. That is not possible, because he has got independence. You cannot force. You can simply give him knowledge. Therefore to distribute knowledge is the best welfare activities, not this material so-called happiness, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva</span> and this... They have got that. That will not make them happy. If you give them knowledge, then they will be really benefited. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> How do we give knowledge to the common masses of people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, by <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> By hearing, hearing, hearing-this is a medicinal process-the heart will be cleansed and they will take up the knowledge. Now the heart is unclean, so he cannot take up. So this is the medicine. <span class="Italic">Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā. Harer nāma harer...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> wherever possible, and whoever will hear, he will gradually become cleansed. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> And then <span class="Italic">bhava-mahā-dāvāgni...</span> Then his material pangs will be over. This is the only medicine. Therefore chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Some way or other, let them have the chance of hearing, and then it will act as medicine. Even he does not will, you chant, you let him hear by force, and he will be cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes you say only a very small percentage can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But yesterday morning in your lecture you were saying it can expand to ten thousand, million, or ten million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if you take the proper way it can be increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Is that just up to our preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That will depend on your purified preaching activities. If you again become materially victimized, then you cannot do it. If you remain on the spiritual platform, if you try, then it will increase. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.</span> It will increase. As soon as there is any contemplation of sense gratification, then the spirit will be lost. Then instead of Christianity, it will be "Churchianity," officially going to the church, doing nothing, and gradually nobody will go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Like the Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere. Christians... Now who are coming here, in so many temples? Nobody is coming. They have made it a business, "Oh, the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birthday, you come here." And somebody will come, collect some money, and then there is no business-go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That requires our personal austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That requires our personally being austere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. And what is austerity? It is very simple thing. <span class="Italic">Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yoga-prayojitaḥ, janayaty āśu.</span> If you continue devotional service to Lord Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa, then automatically the effect of these austerities will become, <span class="Italic">janayaty āśu,</span> very soon. <span class="Italic">Vairāgyam.</span> Austerities means detachment to the material world. That is the result of austerity. So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">janayaty āśu vairāgyam.</span> Simply by executing devotional service to Vasudeva, that <span class="Italic">vairāgya,</span> detachment, very soon arises. Come. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is very good engagement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> It says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that persons who at least attempt to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, they again, at least they get human form of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So what is the position of <span class="Italic">tyāgīs,</span> persons who are simply trying to renounce material life? Do they... Are they considered on the devotional path, or do they have to fall down into lower species of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that considered attempting to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, simply to give up, say, material sense enjoyment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, these <span class="Italic">tyāgīs,</span> Māyāvādīs, by their process they may attempt <span class="Italic">paraṁ padam,</span> means Brahman effulgence. But Brahman effulgence being simply, what is called, eternity. But a living entity does not want simply eternal life, but he wants <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Now, suppose if you are given, if God says that "You live here in this field eternally," would you like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> It's boring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you alone live in this field eternally, that is not bliss. That is punishment. You see? So that is nature. We want <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> blissfulness. Therefore those who are... <span class="Italic">Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padam [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> After severe austerities they rise up to the Brahmān effulgence, but on account of his original nature of <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> he cannot remain there. He again falls down. "Oh, it was better, family life. What is this nonsense? Eternally sit up in this field? What is this? Let me go to the town and work there." You see? That is your nature. Therefore these impersonalists who want to merge, they can merge, but there they cannot remain. They will again come. These so-called <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they give up everything<span class="Italic">-brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā-</span>Vivekananda or this Karpatri. Again they come to these material activities. Somebody takes social work, somebody takes political work. But if it is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> if it is false, why...? [break] But they have... [break] Again come, open hospital, do political work. They cannot stick up. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So they are not saved from the greatest danger of falling down...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> ...into the lower species of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will fall down. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says. They will fall down. The same example: if I ask you that "You sit down in this vacant land and you live eternally," you will leave this place: "No, no, I don't want this eternity. Let me go to Calcutta." (laughter) [break] ...perpetually. So that is wanted. The spiritual kingdom is Brahman effulgence, and there are Vaikuṇṭha planets. So if you take shelter of the Vaikuṇṭha planet, then you can stay. And if you take simply the impersonal Brahmān, sky, you cannot stay there. <span class="Italic">Arūhya kṛcchreṇa patanty adhaḥ.</span> So without varieties, simply impersonal conception of Brahmān will not make you happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> The descriptions of Goloka Vṛndāvana, that even the dust is personal... So we have experience of personal form. Even Kṛṣṇa's form is personal. How is the dust of Vṛndāvana personal? How is it individual living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want something from this dust, you cannot get it. That is material. But in Vṛndāvana, even from the dust if you want any, he will deliver immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Would you like to see the land that we have got here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Just take one moment. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...for enjoying, but if He's our friend...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For enjoying and getting slaps also, both thing. You see? When the children enjoys, sometimes the father slaps also. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Disobedience. They do something that is harmful to themselves or to others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can enjoy life, material life, as the father directs. So that is devotional service. Then you will enjoy. Otherwise you will get slapped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> So-called enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you manufacture your program of enjoyment, then you will be slapped. And if you enjoy according to the direction of the father, then you'll enjoy. This is the... Kṛṣṇa says, "Enjoy life. All right. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī.</span> Live peacefully. Always think of Me. Worship Me." That we have prescribed. Come here and think of Kṛṣṇa. And so that is enjoyment. So they don't want. They want liquor. They want illicit sex. They want meat. So therefore they must be slapped. Actually all this whole universe is made for your enjoyment, but enjoy it according to His direction. Then you will enjoy. That is the difference between demigod and demon. The demon wants to enjoy, manufacturing his own way of life. And the demigod, they enjoy better than the demons because under the direction of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Why does Kṛṣṇa provide the living entities with these sinful pleasures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simple pleasures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Sinful pleasures, such as becoming intoxicated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa does not provide. You create your sinful. Kṛṣṇa never says that "You eat meat," but you open slaughterhouse, so you suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But there is a pleasure, a certain pleasure derived from these sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that pleasure? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, some people like to... They get pleasure from intoxication, they get pleasure from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And therefore they suffer aftereffect. That is ignorance, that immediately you get some sense pleasure, but the result is very bad. And that is sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You wrote in the Fourth Canto that if we have too much sense pleasure when we are young, then we have corresponding disease when we are older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here material life means as soon as you violate the rules and regulation, you suffer. Therefore <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is the beginning of perfection in material life. It is the beginning. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> God has created this. If you adopt this institution of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> then your perfection of life begins. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Everyone is sending their sons and daughters to the university and colleges, and they are getting degree, but they are not getting any jobs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa never says that, that "You send your children to the universities and make them fools and rascals." So one who is depending on job, he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> That is not education. Education is not meant for the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> but for the <span class="Italic">dvijas,</span> twice-born, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya,</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśya. Śūdras</span> are never for education. So their education, so-called education, means creating so many <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Unless he gets a job his education is useless. Therefore he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> And <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya-</span>they will create their own means of livelihood. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya.</span> Therefore they are unhappy. They don't get job, neither they are able to work independently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> Punishment is not the best means of reformation. Sometimes if someone is sent to jail by the government, he'll simply be thinking, "Oh, when I can get out and depose these rascals?" So if someone is punished by God, he might become more angry towards God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that does not mean God will stop punishing. Just like these animals. The stick is there. He may be angry, but stick is required. Otherwise you cannot work with him. <span class="Italic">"Hut!"</span> You see? The stick is there in his hand. Otherwise he cannot get work. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> So eventually they will have to surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without surrendering there is no other alternative, willingly or unwillingly. (end)</div>
