<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The people who were there, they all paid to come to that engagement. They did not come free. Five marks. About two dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many men came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There were about 120, 130. At least. I counted them. That many... Engagement. <span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: Hmm?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And the lecture was very, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good morning. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So last night our explanation was right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. Lots of people of the country was in the football, was going in the football.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This week is the big world football matches. So everyone goes to see that. They either stay at home and watch television or they go to the fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have been taught like that. What is their fault? They do not know the importance of human life. "Eat, drink, be merry, and enjoy." That's all. And then become a dog. That's all. They do not know. And they say, "Never mind I shall become a dog. After all, I will forget everything." (Haṁsadūta translates into German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many planets, so many different standard of life. Nothing. They do not know anything. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (German man):</span> But the other planets has a more spiritual form than our planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Material forms. Just like in the water, the fish is there. That is also material form. But you cannot live within the water. Neither the fish cannot live on the land. So in different planets there are different types of atmosphere and different types of body also. You cannot go to the sun planet. You cannot go to the moon planet because that is a different atmosphere. But there are living entities. They have got their suitable body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But I think for the people it is difficult to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are fools. How they can understand? (laughter) Simply fools eating meat and becoming like a tiger and dog. That's all. What...? Tiger may be very strong, but what brain he has got? No brain. (laughs) For brain, there must be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Satya śama dama titikṣa</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> He must be qualified. A tiger may attack me and kill me. He is very strong. But that does not mean he has got better brain than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, yes, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the modern civilization is making tigers, how he can be bodily strong and kill others, and discover atomic bomb. They are busy only on these things. The dog's business, how to attack another dog. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> This will be a very nice country here for your community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And I think a very, very good example for the people around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the advanced human beings, they come to shoot here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (translates to German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And then it will be finished. And later it will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The animals, they are living in their own atmosphere, and these people, they come to kill them. Killing business has become very prominent at the present moment, and therefore they are being killed in the womb of the mother, abortion and killing child. That they do not know. Nature will not excuse you. You are killing; you'll be killed within your mothers' womb. You'll never see the light of the sun. You go on being killed, one after another, as many animals you have killed. They do not know. And time will come in this age when there will be no food and man will kill man and eat. That time is coming. Yes. They are now killing animal, but animal lives on this grass and grains. When there will be no grass, no grains, where they will get animal? They'll kill their own son and eat. That time is coming. Nature's law is that you grow your own food. But they are not interested in growing food. They are interested in manufacturing bolts and nuts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Manufacturing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bolts and nuts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, yes, yes. I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Factory, big, big factory. So they will have to eat bolts and nuts. Where they will get food grains? They thought that "Let us eat the animal and manufacture bolts and nuts." Then when the animal will be finished, then what they will eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The scientists are making artificial food; so they're not that worried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, that is... That I say bolts and nuts. That artificial food means bolts and nuts. Somebody told me that they have manufactured artificial butter and by eating they were vomiting. They're vomiting. There is ample butter supply. Why these rascals are interested in manufacturing artificial butter to show their scientific brain? Just see how they are rascals. They can get, huh? Just like Kṛṣṇa was stealing His mother's butter and throwing it to the monkeys. Butter can be produced in that way, that everyone can eat sumptuously. No. "Kill the animals and artificial butter you eat and vomit." That's all. Just see their intelligence. And they are proud of their advanced civilization. The same example, that a man barking as a dog, people will go to see it by purchasing ticket. (German translation).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they do not see the natural dog is barking. Artificial, they pay ten dollars ticket and see how a man is barking like a dog. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa. You, at least, introduce in your country: "Chant Christ's name and stop animal killing." This is from Bible. This is not that I am asking. Bible says, "Thou shall not kill, and glorify the name of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Ahiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just in the beginning Christ says, "Thou shall not kill." That is the beginning of religious life. The animal killers cannot understand what is God. It is not possible. There is a statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, viṇa paśughnat.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">nivṛtta tarṣair upagīyamānād<br class="calibre2"/>bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt<br class="calibre2"/>ka uttamaśloka guṇānuvādāt<br class="calibre2"/>pumān virajyeta vinā paśughnāt<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">"Who can remain aloof from the chanting of the holy name of God unless he's an animal killer?" Yes. Animal killers cannot understand what is God, what is God's name. That's not possible. (pause) Kṛṣṇa, what to speak of killing animal, He was embracing animal every morning, every... Yes. He was embracing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't come near. (German translation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And also the holy Francis of Assisi was in relation with all animals in the Christian tradition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Christian tradition there is everything nice, but nobody's following. That is the difficulty. [break] ... portion of the road is not paved like this. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni.</span> Both the man and animals will live prosperously when there is sufficient foodgrain. [break] <span class="Italic">...</span>at <span class="Italic">anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> If there is sufficient rainfall, the production of foodgrains will be very easy. And <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> And if you satisfy the Lord by performing <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> then there will be sufficient rain. And <span class="Italic">yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ.</span> And our activities should be only to perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> to satisfy the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But Sanskrit word for..., <span class="Italic">yajña?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña,</span> sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yeah, <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña</span> means to satisfy the Lord. Just like glorifying the Lord, that is also <span class="Italic">yajña. Saṅkīrtana-yajña. Yajña</span> means to satisfy the Lord. Do it anyway and there will be no scarcity. Everything will be all right. <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhū... </span></div>
<div class="Verse">annād bhavanti bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>parjanyad anna-sambhavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yajñad bhavati parjanyo<br class="calibre2"/>yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.14]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So sacrifice are we self, or ourself. That means sacrifice to the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sacrifice, there are different description of sacrifice. Just like one of the sacrifice is this chanting of the holy name of God. Yes. There are other sacrifices, offering in the fire, butter, grains. That is also sacrifice. But in this age, these things are almost not available. Therefore chant the holy name. This sacrifice is recommended. It does not cost anything. Simply God has given you the tongue, and you chant. Any poor man can do it. (pause) [break] ...excursion? No? (Chants japa softly) <i class="calibre3">Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare R<span class="Bold">ā</span>ma Hare R<span class="Bold">ā</span>ma R<span class="Bold">ā</span>ma R<span class="Bold">ā</span>ma Hare Hare.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Cultured excursion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Weekly and planned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (French man):</span> There is regularly <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> in your community?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here also, there is temple. There is regular <span class="Italic">pūjā,</span> six times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Offering light...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Light, food, everything. Dress, bathing, so many things. If you receive me, you must give me something eatable. Simply light, how can I be satisfied? (laughter) If you give me simply light and no food then how can I be satisfied? Kṛṣṇa says, "Give Me this food." <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati, tad ahaṁ aṣnāmi [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I will eat." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Cigarettes. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tin can. You can get also tin can in the slot? What is that? Paying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh yes. Anyone can get it. There's no restriction. Here's the car. (end)</div>
