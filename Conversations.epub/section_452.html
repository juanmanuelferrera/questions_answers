<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...the original beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Original beauty, just like animals. They remain naked. So the, the original beauty is animal. Because the animals, they do not dress. In the human society, they cover. Animals do not cover. Therefore original beauty is animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say that this is, the body is made by God. Why cover it up? Nakedness is the work of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. God said that you should cover. (Some French boys in background are making mocking sounds, yelling, etc.) And they are becoming naked now. (yelling increases) What is that? They are laughing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Do we go left, Harināma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harināma:</span> To the right. (more yelling, Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> When there is big <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party, then they stop laughing very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are these buildings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This is a big museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Museum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Everything man creates...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why does he die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> We have got knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has created death? Eh? Who has created death? Man creates everything, but who has created your death, Mr. Man? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> He has not created anything then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, no. I accept that man has created anything, everything. But who has created your death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Is there any answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, man has not created death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means somebody has created. So how you can say that man has created everything? The fallacy, just see. How rascal they are. That I wanted to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> You have quoted a great English poet who said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> You have quoted a great English Poet who says that "Man has created the city..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> "...and God has created the country."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the statement of Mr. Cowper. Man has created nothing. Suppose this building, man has created. But wherefrom the ingredient comes. Has man created? This stone, man has created? Eh? What do you think? Is this stone, creation of man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what... You have done the work of a laborer. That's all. You have taken ingredients from God and worked hard and transformed into a step. That's all. Your creation means just like carpenter creates a furniture. That's all. That is his creation. Then that is... The economic law says that man cannot create anything. He can simply transform. These trees, has man created these trees? Why do they claim man has created everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> But they will say that they made the garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They will say that they made a very nice garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. That is the business of gardener, servant, not creator. That is the business of the servant. Just like I keep a gardener servant, and "Do like this. Do like that." That is not he is creator. It is my money which has created. Therefore it is Kṛṣṇa's, everything. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that you have not created anything. You are servant. You are working, and Kṛṣṇa is giving you your subsistence. That's all. So why don't you accept that you are servant of God instead of claiming that you have created. What you have created? This is our challenge. Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What you have created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Life becomes so artificial. In the big city, people don't see that they depend on God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. City or country, that I don't say that Mr. Cowper is perfect in his statement. City is also created by God. City is also created by God. God has given you the ingredients, He has given you the intelligence, and you create. Eh? Wherefrom you get the intelligence? Eh? Who will answer this? Wherefrom the man gets his intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> From Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is the verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">. Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ.</span> So He is sitting in everyone's heart, and He's giving intelligence. And because the intelligence comes from God, therefore one is more intelligent, one is less intelligent. Because intelligence is not his. It is by the mercy of God one gets more intelligence, one gets less intelligence. So intelligence is supplied by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yet... But they claim to have found a way of making people biologically more intelligent now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The scientists claim that they have found a way of making babies more intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, they are dipping in so many things. Therefore we kick on their face, that say, promise, so many things, but cannot do anything. That is the defect of the so-called scientists. They are promising, "By scientific method, we shall make man deathless." Do they not say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But have they made him deathless? Simply a dream. That's all. Utopian dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Even if they succeed in one area of doing something they promise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...they create something that they didn't want to. They create some other problem that they didn't expect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they have created? They are creating... But still dependent. Suppose they have created this horseless carriage. Now they are crying, "Where is the petrol? Where is the petrol?" So if God does not supply petrol, then all these horseless carriage will be pieces of tin. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā-sukhāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you create petrol?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the value of your, this horseless carriage? You are dependent on God. What you have created? And what you can do? You can create war only to fight, man to man, and when you are in danger, then you go to church; "God save us. God save us." That you can create. And as far as peacefully living, accepting God as the Supreme, you can create war. That's all. That means... Like dogs, they create war. So this is a nice park. Why do you go so far? It is nice park. Now you create something to enjoy. Just like who created this building? Napoleon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee (1):</span> It's not by Napoleon. It's just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> What is it from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee (2):</span> It's a new building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee (1):</span> It's new. It's not hundred years old. It's called Marine Museum, Museum of the Marines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It's a museum for exhibitions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa. The man who created, he's kicked out. "Get out!" What did he do? "I have created this thing. I must enjoy." Why he's kicked out? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Because it is actually not his property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the answer? Why you are kicked out? Answer somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> It's just like this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He's not the real proprietor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore... Yes. And not only kicked out. Who knows that he has been given a different body, maybe cats and dogs? So what is the value of this creation? Suppose I create this building, and on account of mentality, nature gives me next body a dog, and... Then what is my profit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yeah, there was that man who came to see you a couple of days ago. His argument was that we can't really say for sure because it's not perceivable that we will take a dog's body. But at least this is something we can understand. Here's something, a nice accomplishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you understand, but you can understand also that you'll be kicked out. Don't you understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He doesn't know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Therefore, he's a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's a statement that says that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like suppose if I do something here in Paris, and if you say, "Sir, as soon as your visa is finished, you'll be kicked out," shall I be interested to create anything? That is intelligence, that "I will be kicked out after two months. Why shall I construct such a big scheme?" That is intelligence. So these rascals know that he'll be kicked out. Still, he works day and night for collecting bricks and stones and he becomes a big man. Mean a foolish rascal, he is considered a big man. Therefore <span class="Italic">śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> People argue that "God has given us our intelligence and our senses, and therefore we must enjoy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You enjoy. The dog is also enjoying. What you are enjoying more than the dog? Dog also eat. You also eat. Dog also sleep. You also sleep. Dogs also enjoy sex life. You also enjoy sex life. Dog is also afraid of his enemy. You are also afraid of your enemy. So what is the difference between you and dog? Why you claim that you have become very great? What is the difference between the dog's mentality and your mentality? God has given you intelligence to understand that you are nothing, God is everything. Just realize it. That is intelligence. That is intelligence. When you understand that "God is great. I am His servant," that is real reali... That is his intelligence. Otherwise, he's exactly like the dog. What is his intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But people today have reasoned God is dead with their intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is not dead. Your intelligence is dead. You have got a dead body, and you are proud of it. Eh? Decoration of the dead body. And you are decorating the dead body. The body's dead. That's a fact. Because as soon as you, soul, get out, it is dead body. But the body's already there. That means I am occupying a dead body. So long I am there, it is working only. But the body's dead. And you are decorating the dead body. You are so intelligent. You are interested with a dead body. And you have no intelligence to see that actually it is dead body. Because as soon as I will go away, it is dead body. The body is dead, but... Just like motor car. It is dead. If there is no petrol, it is dead. Similarly, your body is dead. Now try to understand. And if somebody decorates a dead body, is he very intelligent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Your all acquisition is decoration of the dead body. That is a verse, <span class="Italic">aprāṇasya hi dehasya mandanaṁ loka-rañjanam. Loka-rañjanam.</span> You can get some rascal and fool, some applause, "Oh, you are so nice. You are decorating dead body." But intelligent man will say "What a fool he is that he's decorating a dead body. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's like the story of the emperor's new clothes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There's a story about an emperor who commissioned a tailor to make some clothes for him. So the commissioner, the tailor, outsmarted him and told the king, "I have made you invisible clothes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So the king said, "Oh, how wonderful. I'm the only person with such clothes." So he wore the invisible clothes and went out in public. And because he was the king, everyone was saying, "Oh, just see how beautiful clothes he has." But then one simple person said: "Why is the king walking naked?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So a simple person is more intelligent than the so-called sophisticated citizens. Decorating the dead body. I think in my <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> I wrote this article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> One old <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> One old <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Decoration of the dead body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They might ask why we decorate the Deity if we say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Why do we decorate the, a stone Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is not dead; it is living. They can put forward this argument. But that you do not know, that we are not decorating... We are, we are decorating the real body. Now what will be your question next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You say it's a real body, but it appears to be stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why stone? Stone is also God's body. You don't know that? Do you know it or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, in the Universal Form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Universal Form... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">. Bhūmi</span> means the earth. "That is My body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But there are no... They would say that there are no symptoms of life in the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is life, but you have no eyes to see. There is life. He's the supreme life. Only <span class="Italic">premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">,</span> one who is devotee, he can see. Otherwise, are we fools, rascals, that we are worshiping a dead body? Do you mean to say after reading so many books, we are worshiping stone? You have no eyes. You have to create that eyes to see that "Here is personally Kṛṣṇa present, <span class="Italic">arcāvatāra."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"> <span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They can't even see that in an animal other than human there's soul. So how can they understand the Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> so therefore they have to become our student and become our disciple to understand this science. Otherwise, why there is propaganda if we remain the same fool and rascal? That, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that the stone is also, that is <span class="Italic">virāḍ-rūpa.</span> That is also Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But by that argument, then, this body is also Kṛṣṇa, made of earth and water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is Kṛṣṇa's. But you are thinking you are. That is Kṛṣṇa's. Therefore this body should be engaged for Kṛṣṇa's service. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You, as soon as you accept this body is Kṛṣṇa's, then you cannot employ it for other purposes. But that realization you have no. Why do you say it is Kṛṣṇa's? You are thinking your body. Or you are body. Where is that consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The impersonalists argue when they read the verse, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya bhūteṣu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They argue that Kṛṣṇa's in the heart of every living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Therefore, every living entity is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If I am in the room, I am room? Is that very good argument? Because I am in this room, I have become room? Is that argument very sound? Kṛṣṇa is within this body. I am also within this body. But does it mean I am body, or Kṛṣṇa is this body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is everything; again Kṛṣṇa is... That is... What is the verse? <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:</span> "I am spread all over the universe in My impersonal feature." <span class="Italic">Jagad avyakta-mūrti..., mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Everything is in Me." <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ te...,</span> "But I am not there." This is called simultaneously one and different. <span class="Italic">Acintya-bheda,</span> that one has to understand. Where there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is different from Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, everything is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The other religions do not give any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not talking of religions. We are talking of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So don't bring in any religion. A type of religion is made, "Believe something blindly." So that is not our concern. We are talking of the science. If I say that stone is also Kṛṣṇa, is not that the science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's the science of how God's energies are working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like if I say heat is also fire. Is there any wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Heat is also fire. But at the same time, heat is not fire. What is the difficulty to understand? If I say heat is also fire, but it is not fire, where is the wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Heat comes from the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore the fire quality is there. Heat is the quality of the fire. Just like I taste sugar. The sweetness is also sugar. And the form is also sugar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, they would say, "If stone is also Kṛṣṇa, then why aren't we worshiping all stone?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Then why don't we worship all... Here is also some stone. Why don't we worship this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You worship. Because you are rascal, you worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We, we worship Kṛṣṇa in His form, but you are formless. You worship that stone. When we make the form of Kṛṣṇa in stone, then we worship, not that any stone. Because Kṛṣṇa is everything, that does not mean I have to worship the dog. That you worship. Because you are impersonalist, you worship dog. And you are doing that. In the morning, you take a dog and worship it. That is your business. Our business is to worship the form of Kṛṣṇa. That is the, required. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Could we say that anyone who is engaged in glorifying the body is actually engaged in idol worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Anyone who's engaged in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already answered. Kṛṣṇa says, "The body is Myself, but still, I am not there." So you cannot say by worshiping your body, you're worshiping Kṛṣṇa. At that time, he's not there, although the body's also Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Sometimes, they argue, "How do you know this Deity is Kṛṣṇa, and this one isn't? Because each Deity looks a little different to the material eyes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to pluck out the material eyes. Then you'll see that it is all right. First of all, let me pluck out your material eyes. Then you'll see. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">premāñjana-cchurita:</span> "Eyes with love of Godhead." Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He saw Jagannātha Deity, Jagannātha Deity's not very beautiful. But immediately He saw Kṛṣṇa and fainted. You have to make that eyes, then you'll see. So your present eye have to be plucked out. Then you'll see. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Who is that statue? You are...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It's a decoration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Where do we go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> There's a promenade around the fountain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they have made this art. Suppose a real man and woman stands here. Will it be considered as art or criminal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It would be considered criminal to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Their art is criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But their argument is that when you glorify the body of man with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't glorify the body of... Who glorifies the body of man? We say it is dead body. Dead body means that does not need glorification. It is condemned. We say dead body, decoration of the dead body. We don't say art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Catholic Renaissance Art, they glorified the dead body. Leonardo da Vinci, they glorified the body of man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called <span class="Italic">bhūtejya.</span> That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as worshiping the material elements. That's all. Here in western countries, that is the prominent thing, <span class="Italic">bhūtejya.</span> (pause) What is the other side? Lion? (pause, break) They cover with some cloth, some loose cloth. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is French art, to make naked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Little more advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. Therefore nowadays students are walking naked in America. Advanced, more advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There was one picture in the paper of one student running to receive his diploma without any clothes on. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how much rascal they are becoming. (to devotee:) Take care of your son. It is... Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If the material creation is created by Kṛṣṇa, then man cannot destroy it although they are thinking that if they have a nuclear war, then they will destroy the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they will destroy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They're thinking the earth will just blow up with all the atomic bombs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means this earth will be finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're expecting that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The earth will be finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They think it's within their power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's within their power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within their power, so many things they're imagining. That is not possible. He can make a big hole only. That's all. Then where he'll stand? Suppose he finishes the earth. Then he is also finished. Then what is the credit? If you suicide, if you cut your own throat, is that very good credit? Then what is the credit? Suppose he has manufactured something that the earth will be finished. Then he'll be also finished. So what is God's loss? There are millions of earth-like planets floating in the sky. So one is lost. What is God's loss? It is your loss, that you are finished. Is that very good invention, to finish yourself? You are being finished. And now you have invented instrument to be finished. So you'll be finished. Wait for that. Why you are anxious to invent something to finish yourself? Is that very good intelligence? You'll be finished. That's a fact. So why you have invented machine to finish yourself quickly and you want to take credit? That means he proves he's a nonsense. He's a nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If God is all-good, why does He permit so many wars to go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you want to be finished. You create war to be finished. God does not create. Just like you have created this weapon. In the name of finishing your enemy, you'll be finished, also. Is that very good credit? And God has created like that? You have created. Why don't you understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, why has God permitted me to do such a horrible thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is your little independence. God does not want to touch any... By your independence, go to hell or go to heaven. That's your choice. God says that "Don't use your independence by malpractice." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. God, that is God's statement. "You surrender to Me. I'll guide you." But if you misuse your independence, that's your business. You go to hell or heaven. That's your business. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Where do we go now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The car will be waiting for us down there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You're going to get it right now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They're all demigods, these pictures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Demi-animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is, I think, Adam and Eve, in the midst, middle? There must be some sense in the picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> People are believing that at the end of life, there's just death. So why worry about anything else? Therefore we should just enjoy right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference between you and animal. The animal is in the slaughterhouse. He's not worried. But why you are worried. Suppose if you are brought in the slaughterhouse, and if you know that you'll be slaughtered, are you not worried? An animal is not worried. He's eating grass. That's all. So that is the difference between animal and man. If you are not worried, then you are animal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You once said that human life is pessimistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dissatisfaction. If you are not worried, that means you are animal. You are not human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that like Prahlāda Mahārāja's prayer when he saw Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva and he said, "I am not afraid of Your ferocious form, but I am afraid of this material world of <span class="Italic">saṁsāra."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. He has given nice reference. A devotee, although sees God in His lion feature, and very ferocious, he knows He is God. "He's my Lord." But this so-called advancement of material civilization is the greatest enemy. That is not... Material civilization is very, very backward position. <span class="Italic">Māyā-mohita.</span> He'll be captivated by the so-called stones and bricks, and he'll forget God. That is the disease of the western world. They are very much fond of these stones and bricks, and therefore they have no knowledge about God. This electricity, the electrons, the radio, this, everything machine and stones. They have got, forgotten God. <span class="Italic">Jaḍa-vidyā jato māyāra vaibhava.</span> The more you materially advance, you forget God. So human life is meant for reviving our relationship with God, but if you forget God, then what kind of civilization it is? You are forgetting your real business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Some people use the argument, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that by this advancement of technology, it will free us to think of philosophical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will free us. They will free us. Oh, that will never come. That will never come. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> They are captivated by the external feature, and one who is leading them, he's also blind, and one who is following, he's also blind. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know that material laws are so strong that they are not free to do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They are thinking that the technology will free them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> The technology cannot...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will bind them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It simply creates newer problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Some people glorify suffering in the material world because they say this increases their sense of appreciating the momentary happiness they have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good. (laughter) That is good, yes. "Blessings of adversity." That is blessing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Blessings of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Adversity. Yes. Therefore, according to Vedic system, big, big king, they give up their kingdom and becomes a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> mendicant, voluntary acceptance of adversity. This is good. To live very comfortably and forget God is not good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How can a devotee be free from being attracted to this worldliness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How can a devotee be free...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he's attracted by Kṛṣṇa, he'll forget. Just like we are more or less not attracted by these material features because we have little attraction for Kṛṣṇa. That's all. So increase your attraction for Kṛṣṇa; you'll forget all nonsense. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means more realization of God and forgetting this, all this nonsense. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is the test of <span class="Italic">bhakti:</span> how much you have become disinterested with this material advancement. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> advancement of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> And the... Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says, <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcanasya.</span> At last, when you'll feel that "Now I am dispossessed of all this material nonsense," then you make progress. And so long you'll feel "I have got this, I have got that, I am in possession of this, I...," that means your material disease is continuing. When you'll feel that "I do not have anything material," that is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, what is the devotee's greatest enemy? A devotee's greatest enemy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He, he himself. Because he's a rascal, he's his greatest enemy. So just get out of this rascaldom, and you become your friend. Nobody is enemy. You are yourself your enemy. Nobody is enemy. (pause) Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
