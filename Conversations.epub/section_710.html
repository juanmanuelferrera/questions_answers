<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, we've actually done it. We've changed some genes and made some people better. By experimentation we can make people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And your big, big cities are full with hippies. You cannot induce them to give up their LSD, and you are making better men. Better men is going to become worse. Just see how cheating.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They should close the universities and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So by birth they want to make better men. They can't make them by culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, culture... They adopt real culture. What do they know about culture? They're killing their own children in the womb, and they're cultured? Worse than the animals. The animals do not do that. These rascals, they are cultured? So wretched and fallen, and they are claiming to be cultured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So you can't culture a superior man unless you are one yourself.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Any woman should be looked upon as mother. This is culture. Except his married wife, all women should be treated as mother. The brahmacārīs were taught like that, "Mother." This is culture. Simply they are trying to elope other's wife, other's woman, exploit them. And they're cultured. There is no culture at the present moment. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat:</span> "And others' money should be treated just like pebbles in the street." Nobody cares for it. So they are simply making plans how to grab others' money. And <span class="Italic">Ātmavat sarva bhūteṣu:</span> "And if you feel pains and pleasure, you should consider for others also." If your throat is cut, then do you feel very happy? Why you are cutting the throats of the poor animals? Where is culture? There is no culture. Simply rogues and thieves and rascals and fools. Where is culture? They do not know what is the meaning of culture. Here is culture, three words:</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And treat it like mother. Not only call, but treat it like mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually we have not even any idea how to treat mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Learn it. At least mother should not be proposed for sex. This much you can learn. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat, ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu.</span> [break] ...two questions, that they have not gone to moon planet and they cannot make even a chicken egg, you make great propaganda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, to kill animal is not very heroic. Nonsense. Innocent animal wandering and you kill. "Oh, very great hero." Again he deserves to be kicked on the face. All action, they are simply rewarded with kicking on the face. Why should you kill animal?<span class="Italic"> Ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu.</span> If you are killed, you feel pain. Why should you kill others unnecessarily? [break] ...here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not here, I don't think. A golf course is not a private place.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the window there was "cut, cut." [break] ...African government policy to keep these Africans', er, service, yes, for working, get money. They will remain happy in that way. They have no brain. They cannot govern. It is not possible. So this policy is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Someone was telling me that the weather here was supposed to be like Miami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Miami? [break] ...places were reserved for the sinful man in Kali-yuga. Formerly the Aryans never touched these places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Africa or similar, other places. They were living in best places, like India. Now the number of sinful persons are increasing. Therefore they have been transferred here.</div>

You simply take our advice, and govern." The modern legislative assembly, they should be composed of first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> no salary. Then the government will be first-class. All of them are after money; therefore they are trying to capture the power. They have no idea, no desire for the well-being of the citizens.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you ask some astronomer. I am not astronomer. But I understand from Vedic scripture that moon is beyond the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> 'Cause we have seen that the moon comes between...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, eclipse, it is Rahu. It is Rahu between the sun and, sun and moon. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Between the earth and the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No earth. No, Rahu. Earth is...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They say that every planet gives light. That is not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The reflection I think, of the sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In the moon too there is fire? But it is cold, as the, our sages say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is surrounded by cooling atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It rotates?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In a different way, not as they explain.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They move together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The pivot is the polestar. Fixing, the pole-star, they are moving like this. And there is sun's movement. So we shall go once again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. We can go back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> [break]...friend, and I told him that you said these things. So he asked me the question about the eclipse. So I would like to know to explain to him about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The eclipse is... When the Rahu comes between sun and moon, there is eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It does not eclipse the moon. But why people say that it's the moon that covers the sun? Because they don't know it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are misinformed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They suppose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Astronomers too say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is up to the man to believe or not believe, but we have got authorities, different; they have got authorities, different. So if we follow our authorities, then we have to accept according to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We get in a dilemma, we people who do not know more than they explain about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no dilemma, because our literature is there from millions and millions of years, and they have their knowledge within two, three hundred years. Now it is up to us whom to believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You want to say that the astronomers are the mistaken. The astronomers have been mistaken to say all these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone commits mistake. Anyone who is conditioned, he must commit mistake. This is our position, that anyone who is not liberated, he must commit mistake. We take knowledge from liberated soul, not from the speculators. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They prove their inadequacy by changing their theories every twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They've proved that their brains are weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have no brain. If it is going to change, then what is their brain? [break] Still, there are so many big, big Vedic astronomers. They never change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The astronomers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They follow the old principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Your Guru Mahārāja, he was an astronomer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> [break] ...some astronomers who have the correct understanding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> There are some still. They understand correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Indian astronomer, they correctly say, "This time, this moment, there will be eclipse." How do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the basis of Rahu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> No, he said they correctly know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now recently some European astonomers, they said comet is coming, but he did not come. Just see. But no Indian astronomer said that comet is coming, no Indian astronomer. So he became a fool. So much arrangement was made: "Comet is coming." Nobody came. And in our childhood we saw one comet, and Indian astrologers, they very particularly said, "It will begin from this corner. It will rise like this," in this... Exactly it was done. The comet came, and as it is stated, "From this corner it will come," it happened so, everything correct. [break] ...comet did not come, what people said to this astronomer? Nothing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nobody knows if it came or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was advertised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Just like they were selling land on the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just see. (laughter) He was telling me. Selling ticket. And if I say, "They are cheater, bluffer," they become angry. Just see. Actually they cheated and bluffed so many men. Now they say it is inhabitable. Why they sold ticket for going there? So many living entities there are, living within the sand, and they say there is no living entity. How they are eating? How they are sleeping? A small...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Millions of them. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...airless, Swāmijī. Therefore we can't have the life there. They have proved that it is airless, waterless and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you say there is no life? You see in the sand there are so many lives. So there, if it is desert, there are so many lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In the Sahara desert we can have life there, Swamijī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, but we see practically there are lives. Why shall I believe them? Here I see so many lives are there within the sand. So why shall I believe you when you say that nobody can live there because it is sand or dust. I see practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Here we have air and water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There also there is everything. Therefore I say they did not go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In the moon it may be. But where they went, there. There could have not been there. They say there no life there. It may be in Rahuloka, as you have said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is life in Rahu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> In the ocean they have air? In the ocean is there air? What is the chemical combination of water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot live within the water. Why do you think that others cannot live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, no, I don't mean... Please, Swamijī... I want to say that they have said there is no air and water there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Where is water within the water? Where the air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Not as you call because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> How do they live, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Live where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> How do they live, then? The same example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they live? So this is all misconception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Oh. There should be life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They have a different way of getting the air than we do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or they may not require air. It is God's creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And because they have not seen, therefore they say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here people take in consideration of his position. That is rascaldom. One should not think... There are varieties of life. And how they're in the sun? There is life. So you cannot conceive that there is life in the sun, but there is life. Otherwise how Kṛṣṇa went there and talked with the president of the sun? The president means he's alone there? President means there is kingdom. They have got body made of fire. Can you imagine there can be body made of fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If Kṛṣṇa says, then there must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That is our business. But you cannot interpret. They cannot accommodate within their tiny brain what is going on in the creation. They think in their own way. That's it. Now, they say that the water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. And who supplied so much hydrogen, oxygen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore it is, everything, in God's hand. Their difficulty is that they'll not accept God. That is the... Therefore we are very much angry with them. We want to kick on their face. The atheist number one, all these so-called scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> As soon as they were able to create some oxygen and hydrogen in the laboratory, then "Oh, there's no God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "There is no God." So you bring hydrogen, oxygen; create another ocean. Simply talking nonsense. Now, our challenge is "You just get one egg." Can they? Ask any scientist. Can he make one seed which will bring such a big tree? And where is that science? They're all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They were trying to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Trying." That's it. And therefore they should be kicked on their face. They are trying like foolish man and it will never be successful; therefore they should be kicked. This is our proposition. "Trying," "in future," this is their bluff. We don't accept this. [break] ...one check, million dollars, postdated. Then, if you ask me, "Why you have postdated?" "No, I have no money now. In future it will be deposited." Will you accept that check? This is their bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, why not accept it? It might turn out. It might turn out in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So a rascal like you will accept. (laughter) We are not so... [break] ...transaction, even today's date check, they will not accept. Bring cash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> 'Cause the cheating tendency is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. It is cheating. Postdated check means he cheats. What is the guarantee that there will be deposit of money? Will the bank guarantee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They've done so many good things in the past, you can understand that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No good things. All bluffs. What good things they have done which has benefited the human society or saved the human society from birth, death, old age and disease? What they have done? Our main problem is this. And when there is no food, what the scientists can do? If there is no rice, no wheat? That will come. The scientists will be taught very nicely. Time is coming when there will be no food. Let them produce. Therefore they are trying chemical food, one, one tablet. This is another cheating. Why tablet? Why not actually produce rice by chemical composition? Why tablet? This is their bluff. The Western people, they take dozen of tablets every day. Still, they are the same condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They are becoming more crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...ceptive tablet, sleeping tablet, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Waking tablets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Waking tablets and so on, so on. Tranquilization tablet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They had one tablet for pregnant mothers, and that tablet was used very much in Europe, and that tablet proved to be very harmful to the children that were born. They created terrible deformities amongst many, many children. So there was a tremendous lawsuit against the company. I think it was a German company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What for the tablet was used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Some vitamin for the pregnant mothers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Thalidomide, yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The babies they came out with no arms. Just hands like this coming from their shoulder. Flippers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. This is their cheating. [break] ...everything had been experimented, and they were defeated; still, "science." This is their foolishness. [break] ...telling me that fifty thousand people died by motor accident?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was telling you that. In America they used to have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One city is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Fifty thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Each year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It used to be ten thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, fifty thousand. That was years ago even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the advancement. Every year one city is finished. This is the advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They were making one joke that on the independence day of America everyone goes out in their car and celebrates. They were making a joke that more people will die by the celebration than died in the original battle of getting the independence. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see their intelligence. <span class="Italic">Andha yathāndhair upaniyamanas te 'pisa-tantryam uru-damni baddhaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> By nature's law they are bound up hands and legs, and still, they are trying to do something independently. That is their fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Don't you think that the scientists have done good things but people have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that good thing, first of all say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> For example, they have invented medicines like the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But have they stopped disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, no "but." First of all, they have got medicine for making money, but have they stopped disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> To some extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "To some extent," that is another bluff. That is another bluff. "To future," "some extent." Why some extent? Stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> There were many people dying in Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is dying. How you will live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Malaria...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Will you live forever?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you speak that many are living? You cannot live. That is nature's law. You must die-today or tomorrow. It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They died before time comes. People die before time if there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the present moment they are not dying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Not... They should... There have been more deaths than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So more or less, they are dying. Can you stop it? This is all bluffing, and fools are bewildered by these, all these propositions. You have to die today or tomorrow. Can you stop your death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the benefit of this? And pay the scientists money for bluffing. You'll die today or tomorrow. It doesn't matter. Why you are anxious? After all, we have to die. Just like we are in a friend's place. We have to vacate it. And if two days' advance, "All right, you can remain two days," that means I have got the proprietorship of the house? It is all nonsense. You have to die. Stop this death; then there is credit. If I become proprietor of the house, there is credit. And if I am living for four days, if they give concession, "All right, you can live two days more," is that very great benefit? I'll have to leave it. Similarly, you will have to die today or tomorrow. It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But the Jains(?) can stop this death...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is... Rascals and fools will that: "I'll not die. Tomorrow I shall die. (laughter) Tomorrow." This is rascal. These things will be done by the rascals. "I'll not die today. I'll die tomorrow." This is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> About religion, Swamijī. Religion is capable to stop death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here the... <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is our proposal, to go back to home, back to Godhead. No more death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> After death no death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Okay, then, Swamijī, we should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "After death" means we have got this body; we'll have to leave it. That is certain. But after leaving this body, you are not going to get another body which will die. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. If they can manufacture some medicine that "You have suffered from diseases. Now you take this medicine-no more disease," then there is credit, no more disease. But there is no guarantee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> One kind of disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One kind or another kind, disease is disease. Disease is disease. It is foolish for the person to think, "If I would have gotten that disease, it was better for me." This is foolish, another foolishness. Disease is disease. Disease means suffering. You have to suffer, that's all, this disease or that disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The man who owns this house, his wife died recently from cancer. He sent her to London for special treatment, very costly, and they could not do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Just see. Where is this? That is their science? Take money and do nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least in the past when there was disease people would depend on God more. Now they depend on the doctors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, still they have to depend on God. Otherwise this man spent so much money. God denied, "No, your wife will not stay," and she had to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> [break] ...when she went to London for treatment she became worse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like vitamin pill-no hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. No arms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply they are cheating. There was one gentleman, English gentleman, Sir William Temple. He used to say, "I wish to die without a doctor. Don't bring doctor."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Without a doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Let me die peacefully. Don't bring doctor." I say also. Don't bring doctor when I am diseased. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> [break] There's a chair if you would like to sit out here in the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is not so cold.<span class="Italic"> Jaya. </span>(end)</div>
