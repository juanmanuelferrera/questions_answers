<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Māyāvādīs may die like that, imagining... (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Ara saba bhṛtya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are after, inquiring after Brahmān, but nobody could give them. So they have got it. Now they are taking it. This is stage. (Hindi) That is the stage, <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> stage. So these hippies, they are also giving up all work, that is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> but there is no guide. There is no guide. And because they have no guide, therefore their intelligence is not being purified. Simply there is a propensity for renunciation, <span class="Italic">tyāga.</span> But <span class="Italic">tyāga...</span>(Hindi) After renunciation, what is the next stage, they do not know. That we are giving: "Yes, come here. Stand here." (laughs) Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very successful. They are standing: "We don't want this." But they must stand. So they could not give the standing. But here is... Oh, here is standing. Therefore this movement is successful. They want some standing. And where is the standing? (Hindi) So unless you get a solid ground you cannot stand. You'll fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ. Kirāṭa-huṇāndhra-pulin...</span> Huh? (Hindi) [break] ...obeisance to guru. Then his guru, then his guru, up to Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">...paramparā</span> system. You cannot directly approach God. That is useless. You have no power to approach God directly. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Guru kṛṣṇa kṛpayā</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) Let them study this philosophy. We have got books, enough books. One cannot read all these books even throughout whole life. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) You do actually work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So I can also accompany certain places like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You arrange. We can go there with all party. Now here in this part... You can get. This... Immediately we can go. From India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> From India, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can go to Indonesia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> At the end of March we can go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You also come. Arrange like that. After finishing our program in Simla, let us go to Indonesia. You do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. At least at the present moment nobody can give better thing than what I am giving to the world. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> There are many things you can give us. I'll arrange the tour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are present, a tourist program here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I was there. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this program...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I wanted to join with the camp in the public but nobody was convenienced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you could have informed him. You could come to the pal... Anyway, next, next, tomorrow also we'll have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I no way want to disturb...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hamsadutta:</span> No, you won't disturb. You'll enhance us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Tomorrow I'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you are staying here? [break] ...actually inquisitive, he'll capture it. It is not the question of... Japan. [break] ...personal ambition. It is service to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are canvassing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That word, that <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā,</span> that is the position of the whole world. Yes, that is the position. They have enough seen about this material nonsense. Now that is the position. They want to know what is this Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is called Treta-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is not this <span class="Italic">yuga.</span> This is called Kali-yuga. But... Then it will come, Satya-yuga. And that is long, long after, 400,000's of years after. (laughs) Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
