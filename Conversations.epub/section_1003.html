Old figure, not very beautiful, and this man has fainted." Actually there is nothing so extraordinary that one should faint but we see practically that Caitanya Mahāprabhu fainted, "Here is My Lord." It is the question of vision. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> [At this point a tik-tik lizard makes his sound] It is also confirmed.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salve, yes. That is the word, salve. The salve of love. One who has painted the eyes with salve of love, he gets it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> But sir, there will only be a few who can reach that stage, but the down-trodden...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">You cannot make such person by showing film. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, that I agree. It is not possible to make men devotees or religious by showing films. But at least those who cannot read our books, to whom individually we cannot reach in spite of our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they know, they hear. They hear. There are different processes. They know Kṛṣṇa (indistinct). Just like in India the Janmāṣṭamī is coming, I think cent percent houses will observe Janmāṣṭamī. There is no doubt about it. Either he's a devotee of Kṛṣṇa or not, even some Muhammadans are there. I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, Parsees, Muhammadans, (indistinct)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They observe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They observe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So to some extent they have got some affection for Kṛṣṇa but not to that extent. They, there maybe one man may seeing Kṛṣṇa's pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I think generally people are more attracted to our society by the behavior of devotees rather than philosophy, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. Philosophy is there but generally when they see the devotees, and by association, purification comes. As you say, there are so many books about... If the movie is made, just like our Hare Kṛṣṇa People movie, this is showing the practical example of how one can live Kṛṣṇa consciously and solve all the problems of the day-to-day life. Such a movie can attract people to become devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For the students it is good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> For everyone. I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who cannot read the book, they are still better. Those who can read the book, they are still more dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They will misinterpret the whole thing. They will misrepresent, the danger is still more there. It is rather more with the educated people that the danger is there than the uneducated. But to reach the uneducated we have, I was thinking this is a better media. This is one of the medias perhaps, I wouldn't say better. Perhaps one of the medias by which we can reach them in a larger crowd.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But not in the way that the films are made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that is not say. I don't want. I could produce...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Kṛṣṇa consciousness is developed when one practices according to the prescribed method,</div>
<div class="Verse">tapasā brahmacaryena<br class="calibre2"/>śamena ca damena ca<br class="calibre2"/>tyāgena satya-śaucābhyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yamena niyamena vā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These are the process, <span class="Italic">tapasya, brahmacaryena.</span> So it is very difficult for the common man to undergo <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Little <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> we have introduced, no illicit sex, no meat eating, no gambling, no intoxication. That is also become very difficult nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But is it not possible that we (indistinct) name of society for Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then they will be attracted more and more and they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you want to attract people you have to show that you (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> There are good persons who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That good person is very, very rare. I... [break] ...education point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless one is put into practice, it is not possible. That is Vedic culture. From the beginning of life students were sent to <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> for practicing how to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> That training (indistinct). Then they are trained as <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> then <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> and ultimately <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> completely renounced. Immediately, a person cannot be renounced, therefore gradually, step by step. So unless there is proper training... Now just like we are selling millions copies of these books, they are reading, and how many of them coming forward? So it requires training. Training is essential to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> I would rather request that you direct your efforts... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one goes in the village without any dress, without any, if he plays the part of Kṛṣṇa's and somebody plays the part of Rādhārāṇī, thousands of people will come. There is no need of film. <span class="Italic">Yatra-</span>party.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say, that mass of people will come. As soon as they hear that here is some play going on, Kṛṣṇa pastimes, still in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> It is there, sir, so what my submission was that what we do as film producers and in this line of business, that we do it more on commercial basis. Gimmicks are there, castings are there, but then it is not so much educative. What your Prabhupāda wants to convey. If, as a member of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Education you cannot give. Education means it is practical practice. But to show something, that you can attract even without film. The <span class="Italic">yatra-</span>party can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Yatra-</span>party, sir, here again the problem is India's a vast country and for that purpose if you take the whole world as a place, how many <span class="Italic">yatra-</span>parties can you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say, that even if you attract better crowd, what will be the benefits? Unless, because unless you come to the point of practicing, there is no profit. Who will be attracted to practice Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. Nobody is... We are getting practical experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In other words just being attracted to philosophy is not sufficient. There has to be... Let them become a devotee. (indistinct remarks)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now just like we are attempting-not only here, everywhere-we have got nice buildings, and (indistinct) and Bombay we have constructed such big, big house so we are asking, at least those who are learned people, that if they retire, come here and practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness. No, nobody's prepared to practice. And this is a thing, without practice you cannot realize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That is why sir, we don't going outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Whole thing if we make it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like, practice is also not very difficult. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you daily come to the temple, see the Deity, he'll have some impression and he can think of Kṛṣṇa, how He is playing flute, how He is nicely dressed, how Rādhārāṇī is standing (indistinct). Then <span class="Italic">man-manā,</span> he can think of Kṛṣṇa very easily. So <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto,</span> and as soon as you think of Kṛṣṇa, you become a devotee. Because a businessman will not spare so much time thinking (of) Kṛṣṇa, how He is playing flute. He has no business. Without being <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> nobody will be interested to meditate on Kṛṣṇa, how He's standing, how He's playing flute. This is <span class="Italic">bhakta's</span> business. So anyone who is planning some trying(?) to think of Kṛṣṇa, that means automatically he becomes <span class="Italic">bhakta, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto. Mad-yājī,</span> then naturally if he becomes <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> naturally then why not offer to Kṛṣṇa something? Eh? Naturally. Give Him some fruits, some flower, some grains. Then Kṛṣṇa is accepting them, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So to think of Kṛṣṇa, to become a devotee and to offer Him something, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ,</span> and offer Him obeisances, these things are development of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. And the result is, find out this verse, <span class="Italic">man-manā. Mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.65]<span class="Italic">,</span> by simply executing these four principles, Kṛṣṇa assures that you will come, <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaḥ,</span> without any doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Without (indistinct).</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But as soon as you say "mythology," there is no Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Don't say "mythology," I mean to say, my meaning was that they are distorting all our religious... They are making films, putting something, unusual things and cheap things. We can reform them and bring...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, unless (indistinct) it will not to the art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> You can bring these (indistinct) into the art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you can use your art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to give some incentive but the thing is unless we practice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> That is the most important. Practice is of... That is the essence. Of course, that is the essence but to bring to the essence something should be (indistinct) people to the right path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can be a part of the propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes, because in India even this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But for that part of propaganda, the energy will be required (indistinct). Money energy. Who can spare good money energy? Just like Kṛṣṇa is lifting the..., you'll show in the picture. You can inform also about that lifting by talking with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> No, that is no sir. What my suggestion was that we are conveying whatever is there in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> whatever, whatever one subject we take. While we are discussing the subject... After all, we are also all human beings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have already said that you can take it as part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Same time we give some flashbacks and in with cluded(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See the print, don't smoke, no vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> No sir, in the cinema houses they don't smoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is another thing but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Of course, by force it has been in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But even you can request also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We can do. I mean that is not a stage by stage... That stage can be reached, sir. They will feel that they will be ashamed to smoke when such a spiritual thing is being shown to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Creating an atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Gradually it can... It is not a thing of a day. It will take years to come. We will have to go and my point was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But here there is no question of begin. Hare Kṛṣṇa speculation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> In the midst of film you can some Hare Kṛṣṇa (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But we are... Suppose I am getting, sir as you say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Begins. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">,</span> if there is any other motive, then immediately there is no (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Verse">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāna-karmādy anāvṛtam<br class="calibre2"/>ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-<br class="calibre2"/>śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Maybe little <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> touch but <span class="Italic">uttama-bhakti,</span> the definition is <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it is very difficult for the actors and actresses to give up the commercial life. <span class="Italic">Anyā...,</span> that is <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣ,</span> that by playing like this, I'll be popular, I'll get money, this is <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣ.</span> So to make it zero is very difficult. <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> No (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. But everything can be dovetailed, <span class="Italic">nirbandhe kṛṣṇa sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate.</span> Just like our Sītā-Rāma(?), she wants to do some display to help Kṛṣṇa movement. That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> She wanted to make the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> She wanted to make the money in this country. She would have the money, the richest artist in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> But of course she is dedicated, as you say, without any motivation and even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money, money-making isn't made, money comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> She has not commercialized...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no commercialization. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">yad karoṣi yaj-juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasya kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam [Bg. 9.27].</span> To earn money, it is not bad, but if it is given to Kṛṣṇa then it is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> That is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> Very well, she has done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Just like Arjuna, he was a soldier but he fought for Kṛṣṇa. That is a military art. For his personal, he refused, "No, no, I am not going to fight with my relatives." But when he understood that Kṛṣṇa wants it, he did it. So anything, if we dovetail with Kṛṣṇa's service, that becomes <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> (indistinct) Just like Kṛṣṇa is saying, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who is offering in devotion a little leaf, little flower, little water, "I accept." So Kṛṣṇa is not poverty-stricken that He wants from me something but He wants your <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> that you become a devotee, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto.</span> He wants that. So if the poorest man also gives something in <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> Kṛṣṇa accepts it. So that does not mean that I have got money, Kṛṣṇa is satisfied with little flower, so give little flower to Kṛṣṇa and enjoy this money for my sense gratification. (chuckles) That is cheating. That is cheating. Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you do, <span class="Italic">kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam,</span> give Me that," and that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So whatever position we may be in, if our life is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> it doesn't matter what is his status, qualification. Kṛṣṇa is unlimitedly everything. Just like we are spending <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">crores</span> in this, for this purpose. They may say that Kṛṣṇa is satisfied with <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> why you are spending so much money? The idea is that when there is money, if you simply offer Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ toyaṁ,</span> that is cheating. Kṛṣṇa knows it. If you have got money, then you must spend-a gorgeous temple for Kṛṣṇa. That is proper utilization. Not the money is kept for my separate use and Kṛṣṇa may be offered a little leaf and water. According to one's position, he must worship Kṛṣṇa. So Bombay is so rich, therefore you are collecting. Spend for this temple, spend for this temple. Otherwise it will be spent for other purposes. Money will be spent, it will not stay. <span class="Italic">Samdimite varuṅkala vinaśiniyate sati</span> (?), money will not stay. At least at the time of my death money will remain where it is, I (indistinct). So money, so long is in my hands, let it spend for Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> It will be spent. How we are going to separate it? There is no excuse. So long it is in my possession, let it be spent for Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Whatever I know.... We are not of that pleasure, we say, "Don't touch money." No, not only touch, we can consume any amount of money. Bring it and we spend for Kṛṣṇa. That is our proposal. We are not that so-called renouncer that as soon as there is money my face becomes deformed, my hands go this way. No, we capture immediately and spend it (indistinct) for Kṛṣṇa. Lakṣmī, Lakṣmī is to be engaged in the service of Nārāyaṇa. Just like Sītā-devi, Lakṣmī she is meant for serving Nārāyaṇa, Rāmacandra. Rāvaṇa thought that "Take away the Lakṣmī from Rāma." He became vanquished, finished. He could not keep Lakṣmī but he became vanquished because she (he) wanted to enjoy Lakṣmī without Rāma. But Lakṣmī cannot stay without Rāma, Nārāyaṇa. That is false attempt. So he became vanquished, with money, with family, everything, personal, everything. So if we want to keep Lakṣmī without Nārāyaṇa, then it will not be very good. Lakṣmī keep with Nārāyaṇa, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, there will be... (end)</div>

So this is not the business of <span class="Italic">paṇḍita. Nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> So this is the position. People are unaware of self-interest.

To hear the answer to this question is the prime subject matter of hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists." Purport: "Even the very question is so nice that it is the best subject matter for hearing. Simply by such questioning and hearing one can achieve the highest perfectional stage of life. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Person, any question about Him is original and perfect. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that the highest perfection of life is to achieve the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa. Because questions and answers about Kṛṣṇa elevate one to that transcendental position, the questions of Mahārāja Parīkṣit about Kṛṣṇa philosophy are greatly glorified. Mahārāja Parīkṣit wanted to absorb his mind completely in Kṛṣṇa, and such absorption can be effected simply by hearing about the uncommon activities of Kṛṣṇa. For instance, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated that simply by understanding the transcendental nature of Lord Kṛṣṇa's appearance, disappearance, and activities, one can immediately return back to home, back to Godhead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is back to home, back to Godhead. Home is here in India, and again back to Godhead?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is the most favorite slogan of everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they're asses. Asses, they want... Even in Tehran, I saw the ass. This is Indian civilization. Loaded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> With pots or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Right. Some tons of things. The ass does not know why he is carrying so much load. Therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span>. What for he is carrying? What is his profit? He does not know. But he's carrying so much. "I am big industrialist. I have got so much business." What for you are doing industry? That he does not know. Ass. <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> are described as asses. They do not know what is the interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> How does it matter what people call Kṛṣṇa, whether they call Bhagavān or Viṣṇu or what, Kṛṣṇa? If it is just only one God. We are talking removing Kṛṣṇa from <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> but putting Bhagavān there instead of Kṛṣṇa. How does it matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "There is no more superior authority than Me."</div>

You have to decide, if you have got intelligence, to take up the instruction of Kṛṣṇa and by happy. It is up to you. What was your question? What was your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> What was my question? I said how does it matter what name we give to Kṛṣṇa, whether we call Him by Bhagavān or other names...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dog, cat, whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> No. As far as for God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, as you say, "Whatever you like." You can call Him a dog, a cat. You can call.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The name of Bhagavān only I said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you know Bhagavān's name? You do not know Bhagavān. How do you know Bhagavān's name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> It is interchangeably used, Kṛṣṇa and Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is interchangeable? Here it says <span class="Italic">mām ekam.</span> Where is interchangeable? Why you manufacture? Fertile brain. Don't make your brain fertile. That is going on, rascaldom. Interchangeable. Why interchangeable? <span class="Italic">Mām ekam. Ekam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa is the only God. That's why there is no other alternative. Kṛṣṇa is the God, there is no alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa is... That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> All incarnation of God is described, and the summary is given at the end that all these names, Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, and so many, hundreds and thousands, so all of them are Kṛṣṇa's plenary portion or portion of the plenary portion. <span class="Italic">Ete ca aṁśa-kalāḥ.</span> And this Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tu bhagavān,</span> He is the original. <span class="Italic">Ete ca aṁśa-kalāḥ.</span> And this Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tu bhagavān,</span> He is the original. <span class="Italic">Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is clearly stated. And Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are many incarnation of God. So many incarnations that you cannot count even. Just like it is said in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that like you cannot count the waves of the river, similarly you cannot count how many incarnations are there. But <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> gives you the information that all these incarnations, innumerable incarnations, they are portions or part of the portions. But <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.</span> And Kṛṣṇa also confirms that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ: [Bg. </span>10.8] "I am the origin." <span class="Italic">Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> What is the difficulty? But unfortunately you have got fertile brain. You manufacture things. And that is your misfortune. It is better to remain a fool before the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Then he'll make progress. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc.</i> <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 7.71]<span class="Italic">.</span> "My guru saw Me a fool number one, and he has chastised Me." When Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī asked Him that "You are a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> You are simply chanting," so He replied like that: <span class="Italic">guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsana,</span> "My Guru Mahārāja saw Me a fool number one. Therefore he has said, 'You simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You rascal, You cannot do anything.' So I am doing like that." He said that. He represented Himself a representative of the fools and rascals. So <span class="Italic">kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.</span> This is the only business, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then you gradually come to your original sense. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> It is very easy thing. People will not take it. They want to see magic, they want to see jugglery, they want to hear all nonsense. This is the... If you talk nonsense, cheating them, they will like it. <span class="Italic">Satya bole tomāre lata yuta jagat bihar dana kali-yuga tuk lage anahaspar.(?)</span> Kṛṣṇa is speaking, but... Personally? That is not good. They'll go to some rascal who can talk jugglery and show magic. Who can show greater magic than Kṛṣṇa? Who has done it? A seven-years-old boy lifting the mountain. That is mythology. When Kṛṣṇa shows something wonderful, that is mythology. Mythology, Vyāsadeva has written mythology. And big, big <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya and Madhvācārya, big, big, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they have studied this mythology and given their comments. Another common sense is that there are hundreds and thousands and millions planets. There is no life, everywhere, rocks and sands, and everything is here? Here there are rocks and sands and there are living entities, there are forests, there is greenness, everything. Variety. Why other planets without varieties? If somebody has created, why he's so dull that he has created everything here, and everywhere simply rocks and sands? And what business he has to do this? Rocks and sand? How he has misspent his valuable time for creating rocks and sand? And wherefrom the sand came? Scientifically, sand is there where there is sea. Because sand is sodium silicate. It is manufactured from salt. So without water there is no question of sand. These things have to be considered. And rock is also combination of sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> In today's <span class="Italic">Times</span> there is a news item. Very light, but it can be giving different sense.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Somebody has given the prediction, I forget his name, but he says that in the next thirty years or so the human beings will discover some things on which gravity does not act.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Human beings will discover some things on which the law of gravity does not work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Law of gravity does not work now also. There is no question of this discovery. You take one small needle and you take one big log. The log will float and the needle will go down. The needle is so less weight, but it goes down. And the log is so heavy, it floats. Where is law of gravity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But that is, that is only relative. Both are being acted upon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore relative, it is not absolute, law of gravity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The thing is, till now we are thinking that light (indistinct) things, and all our thinking was conditioned by that. At least in the scientific context.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientific context... In Hawaii they cut all the coconuts because they are very scientist-law of gravity. But we don't care for this. We don't care. We are keeping the coconut on our head. We never think of law of gravity, that it will fall down. And those who are very much advanced in law of gravity, they have lost all the beauty of the trees, they have thrown the... They are afraid they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Fall on the head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will fall down. This is their gain of life. We have discussed this point. Why the green apple does not fall down? So this is their concoction. And why the other planets do not fall down? With so many rocks. Millions. They do not fall down. Where is the law of gravity acting? That means, law means it is made by somebody. And the maker, if He likes, it will act. If He does not like, it will not act. Just like Lord Rāmacandra, all the stones He threw over the sea and they began to float. Not that when He made that bridge with stones, they are solidified. No, they began to float. And all the monkeys went over them. So the lawmaker is Lord Rāmacandra. If He likes, the stone will go down. If He doesn't like, it will float. The lawmaker is fact, not the law. Just like in the state law, today it is law, tomorrow it is no law. It depends on the lawmaker. [break] ...there is the Govardhana Hill. What law is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even these yogis, they can do that. <span class="Italic">Aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti-siddhi. Aṣṭa-siddhi-yoga.</span> By yogic process you can become so stout and strong that you can take a hill on your... <span class="Italic">Mahimā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> I may come tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I had written to you, and I think Mr. Saurabha had forwarded my letter to you, to which I got a reply, and I was asked to come and meet you today. I just require to is it the right program of the right place or right tell you what I had in mind or perhaps have in mind? I have about thirty acres of land at Udaipur, in Rajasthan. I was trying to make a campus with studios, laboratories, and residential places for these producers, stars, casts, and things. When discussing with Mr. Saurabha I was amazed that some spare land which we had thought of utilizing for horticulture, we could better utilize it for cowherds to have say one hundred cows. I have been thinking, apart from this cowherd business, I have been thinking about this campus for some time back. And when I met Girirāja and we started getting more close together, association, I thought that why not should we have a temple of Lord Kṛṣṇa as the center from where we start the activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. We must have Kṛṣṇa, that's a fact. What is the next proposal? We have got experience. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also introduced this dramatic play, but the play was performed by a great devotee. So unless devotees are trained, this play will not be effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, I have discussed that also with Mr. Saurabha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break]... The devotees who can spare time. First of all, all the devotees, they are also in the training, and if they have to learn another training, it may be very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Sir, you would perhaps agree that... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we are doing. Just like in New York we have got stage. So we are playing something from <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Bhāgavata</span> occasionally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> I saw in New York one month back <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa-gītā.</span> In the temple I saw the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa-gītā.</span> It was really very exciting. My two sons are there in New York, so I took them to the temple. So Your Divine Grace was at that time perhaps busy or something, that I couldn't have the <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I was there you were also there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes, same day I was leaving for India. So I couldn't have your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> I just got there. Girirāja told me... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about the car(?) there? But a film project, it can be done, provided it is done in foreign countries. Here everything is expensive and lacking manpower. [break] To make a film it requires huge amount of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Money perhaps we would be able to..., that problem we will be able to solve now because initially for the project, not only making the film, the whole project of the campus, I have got the blueprint with me. When you are little better, I'll show the blueprint and I'll have your blessings that if I am able to achieve it. What I was thinking that a short film, say, about eight to ten thousand feet, which occupies an hour and twenty minutes or so, initially made. And dubbed into as many languages as can be done, because the sound portion is always separate. And as I was discussing to Saurabha, Girirāja... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The life of Kṛṣṇa is known almost everyone. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes. And also, sir, there are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What benefit they will get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> ...numerous pictures also. What we have to educate the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] By practice. We are training them to practice how to become devotees. By superficial seeing the activities of Kṛṣṇa, this is not... One has to practice. Just like we are going to start <span class="Italic">gurukula. Gurukula</span> means practice. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī guru-kule vasan dāntaḥ [SB </span>7.12.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> How to become self-controlled, <span class="Italic">dānta.</span> That is the... So our mission is to awaken the original consciousness, and that can be done by practice. Without practice, it is not possible. It is not by seeing some picture one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But sir, do we not convey to a larger people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is being done through books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But sir, books are for such people who can read, who can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, something can be done by showing the picture, but taking consideration of the labor and money invested in that way, the response will be not satisfactory. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> What I was thinking was that we have a limited...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply by seeing that Kṛṣṇa is lifting the Govardhana Hill, they'll, many of them will laugh, that "This is all mythology. A boy is lifting Govardhana Hill." Many of them will laugh instead of taking seriously. Because unless one is devotee, he cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as he sees the boy Kṛṣṇa is lifting Govardhana Hill-he does not understand what is Kṛṣṇa-he'll laugh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That is elsewhere.</div>
