<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you called for me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I was asking how many men we can accommodate in the new building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Comfortably we can accommodate five to six hundred men in first-class rooms with first-class <span class="Italic">pakka prasādam</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Bajaj:</span> That's already established and people are already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, it's already established.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Bajaj:</span> Functioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Bajaj:</span> But you have plans to further expand and add many more buildings and temples. Because I've seen the big plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. Prabhupāda has made a plan for fifty thousand devotees to live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Bajaj:</span> Fifty thousand devotees in one place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What activities going on, just describe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> At Māyāpura now we have two hundred resident devotees. We have the handloom, we have our own handloom production. We have <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> distribution to the local people on the weekends. Two to three thousand people a day are given <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and during the week seven hundred to a thousand take full <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> Free? All free distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. And we have our Gurukula, mainly local boys, resident boarding, no day students. When I left there were eighty-five boys. Probably it's increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> All local.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> All local. Our international Gurukula is here. There is local.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> This is the international, here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This Gurukula is international, and our Gurukula in Māyāpura is mainly local Bengali boys, many coming from <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> families, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> Then any industries? Hand industries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Our handloom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> Handloom. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> And our <span class="Italic">gośāla</span> is just developing. That area of Māyāpura, Navadvīpa, is a big handloom...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> Yes, handloom area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Many handloomers. So we have designs to expand that into a very large area, and most of it will be exported to our temples and devotees all around the world. And all of the handloom workers, they're devotees so they don't take any salary. None of us take any salary. And they get nice rooming and full <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and their children are educated. All medicine, everything is supplied to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> You could also, perhaps, introduce this new spinning wheel for the yarn. At present you must be purchasing yarn from the mills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> But have you seen this small nice <span class="Italic">carakā,</span> spinning wheel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Well, we do our own spinning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> Spinning also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Oh, yes. We're training up those who have children... They're trained in the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system. Some of the children in the school have a scholastic bent of mind, so they're educated in Sanskrit and higher studies. Some of them have a <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> bent of mind, and they work in the <span class="Italic">gośāla</span> helping to develop..., milk the cows. Some are... Their parents are working in the handloom. They also have that desire, so they're trained to be handloomers. In this way we will be able to develop a city of fifty thousand devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Bajaj:</span> Let us not overstrain him and whatever if... He'll feel tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We have our main festival in Māyāpura at the end of March, March 24th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> March 24th?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This year? Dola-yātrā. Gaura-pūrṇimā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Our biggest festival. All the devotees from all over the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recently there was a scientific meeting here. Where is that <span class="Italic">Statesman</span> report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> The report from, about Māyāpura? Some literature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, here. We... Just describe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We had a science conference here in Gurukula just about a little more than a week ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Nārāyaṇa:</span> Here in this new building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, the same building, at the same hall that you're going to hold your conference. I invited several scholars, scientists around Delhi and Agra. Also Śrīla Prabhupāda's disciples, scientist disciples, came from around the world. The basic theme was to show that life is coming from the supreme life. In other words everything is coming from Kṛṣṇa. But modern science says that we are just product of atoms and molecules.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This is an article which was published in <span class="Italic">The Statesman,</span> October 22nd, which covers this meeting. It says, "The Nonphysical View on the Origin of Species. Materialists and men of faith continue to disagree over the origins of life. According to the first group life is..." [break]</div>
