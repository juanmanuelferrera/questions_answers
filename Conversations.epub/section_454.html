<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Roger Maria leading<br class="calibre2"/>writer of communist literature<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 12, 1974, <span class="Bold">Paris</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> ...in France amongst the communist students, the communist Indian students. And I said he is also a literary critic. That means that he is writing a lot of articles in the newspaper and explaining many things in the literary circles in France. He also knows very much about Gandhi philosophy. He has been writing a lot about Gandhi's philosophy. So when he knew that you were with Gandhi, he came very interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So we are also communist. As you take the state as the center, we take Kṛṣṇa as the center. Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Where is Karandhara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, Kṛṣṇa, that "I am the enjoyer. I am the proprietor. I am the friend." <span class="Italic">Bhoktāram...</span> Read out this.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-loka-maheśvaram<br class="calibre2"/>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>5.29]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the process of peacefulness, when one understands that Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of all <span class="Italic">lokas,</span> all worlds. And Kṛṣṇa is the best friend of everyone. (French) (aside:) Get the light. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says that liberation of India from the English was done because of many, various forces, but that amongst the people, the common mass of people who helped to liberate India, there was, of course, a religious people. But there was religious people on both sides. There was religious people amongst those who wanted to liberate India, but also among those who wanted the English to be there, not in imperialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, his point, essentially, is that religious sentiment was there on both sides. It was there on the imperialists' side as well as on the side of those who were fighting for India's liberation. So there seems to be a kind of dichotomy. Religious sentiments can be expressed by anyone, whatever their motivation is. Whether it be imperialist, whether it be communist... Religious sentiment is found...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is religious sentiment? (French for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He says again that in India, now also there's a big struggle because they are trying to solve the immediate problems of hunger, you know, all these problems, now, and, of course, there is a religious people on the side of those who are struggling, but there's also religious people on the other side, of those who want to keep the situation as it is now... And then he said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religious people wants to keep the situation? Starving? Starving situation? (French for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You don't understand what he's saying now? Because he has a different translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> Because what he says, he says on the both parts, they are based on a passage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The imperialist people and the other side, they do both, sometimes on the base of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> The communists and the imperialists. And he sees some names, Rajagopalacharya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> This man, for example, the one that he just cite, he is also a religious man, but he is against the change now. He wants to keep as it is imperialism. You know. So he said that there are so many of these people who are religious and they are, of course, all they have good goals, that is to help people. You find people referring <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> on the side of those who are struggling now to change the situation and the side, on the side of those who are keeping the situation as it is. So he says there is an ambiguity there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ambiguity means he is not clear in his knowledge. What is religion and what is liberation-these things he does not know clearly. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He says that now they are using religion for their own interests and for their own goals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that man? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said all the social forces in India wants to keep their own privileges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? The communist does not? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that in Marxism there is no religious references.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the, what is called, terrorism facility, there is. There is no religious sentiment, but there is terrorism sentiment. Some sentiment is there. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that yesterday in Assam seven student have been killed, but is it the communists who killed them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He's saying, is it the communists who killed them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Communists killed others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Seven students in Assam. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he said that in India all the planners of the government, they are religious people. Some of them are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> but still they have been arresting forty-thousand people working on the railways for no good reason. So that's why he said that religion is used by the people for their own privileges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I asked what does he mean by religion. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What he's trying to say is that some people are using...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, it's clear. It's clear. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said one should ask a question not according to what one thinks about religion, but what is being used now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot think, you cannot think of religion. Our conception of religion is different. (French for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where are Satsvarūpa and Karandhara? Where gone? They do not want to hear? They have become...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They're calling Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They may be on the phone with Africa. I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he said that here in France, the Christians, they are now reviewing their own Christianity, their own philosophy, because they see that the materialistic people, they are giving critiques, and they are right in their critiques. So they are changing their religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, he's saying that religion has to be defined according to the way the mass of people accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not religion. That is sentiment. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (To Prabhupāda, as Frenchman speaks in French:) They're on the phone speaking with Brahmānanda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he says that those who have been just religious and working for the independence, they didn't do any real good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, first of all, our proposition is what does he mean by religion? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that there cannot be an abstract definition of religion, but only the experience of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got definition of religion. Let him learn from us. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he says that "I know what is religion, but what brings religion in the concrete life, in day to day life? What good brings religion in the life?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He said, "Even, even if I were to learn your definition of religion, the important thing is how it is practiced. Not just words," he says, "the important thing is how it is lived, how people live their..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The practice. It is practiced... Those who are real religionists, they practice it. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he said this is a real problem, how to practice religion, not only on the individual platform, but also on the social platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are teaching, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are teaching how to practice religion. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that even though he himself is materialist and atheist, he propagates this in his articles, in his newspaper, you know, he propagates certain aspects of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. First of all, we must know what is religion, and what is atheist or what is theist. First of all, if we know what is religion, then we can define who is following, who is not following. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he said what he can give is his own experience of religion and what he is propagating when he talks in his articles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is his experience of religion? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he said that in Hinduism, what he thinks is the best...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Religion is not meant for Hindus or Christians-for everyone. So there must be a general definition of religion. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he said that his idea is that <span class="Italic">advaita-vedānta</span> philosophy is the best in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">advaita?</span> What is that <span class="Italic">advaita?</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that <span class="Italic">advaita-vedānta...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">advaita-veda</span> philosophy? Let him define. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> <span class="Italic">Advaita. A</span> means without. <span class="Italic">Dvaita...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Without"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "Not." <span class="Italic">Dvaita</span> means dual. So non-dual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> Non-dual. "There is not two." This is <span class="Italic">advaita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that one? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So what I think this gentleman is explaining is that he finds the idea of non-dualism very attractive because he says that if a real religion is to fulfill it's responsibilities, then it will not try to teach its followers that there are two separate things, there is the creation, and there is you, the creator, that there is you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> Creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That there is a creator and then you, but rather, that there is a harmony with the individual being and the totality of existence, not just on an individual religious level, but also socially. So in other words, he's seeing that this <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy, this non-dual philosophy is very nice on the political or social level as well since it teaches a kind of unity of the individual with everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not very clear. (laughs) Now, dualism means two, and monism is one. So he says monism, <span class="Italic">advaita.</span> So monism, what is the center of monism? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he says that to discuss what is that center of monism is not as important as it is living the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot... If you have no objective, then you cannot live in one way. (French for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) I'm feeling hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...that before... He says perhaps it would be worthwhile, he finds it worthwhile, before trying to make any definitions about the center, to first free man from all of the things that are keeping him enslaved today. In other words, before we can build a platform for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you do not know what is the meaning of freedom, how you can make them free? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he says the best answer he can give you is an answer that he heard from Maharishi, he said, a very good answer, that before you can come to defining anything positively, first we must say, <span class="Italic">neti neti:</span> "It is not this, it is not that." Then we have decided what it is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am therefore asking. Whatever he is proposing, I say <span class="Italic">neti:</span> "It is not" defining. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You better translate that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says that the answer of that is very often come, although it doesn't have to come with a name of God because the name of God is very often utilized to mystify the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, he's saying, "I know what you want to get me to say. You want me to say that the center is God." But he's saying, "I'd rather not say that because that's too mystical."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of talking if you do not know the central point? He says that to come to the truth, <span class="Italic">neti neti.</span> So we must come to the truth. So we must find out first of all truth. Then we discuss the other, subordinate things. (French) <span class="Italic">Neti neti</span> means "Not this, not this," means to search out the truth. (French for some time, devotees try to explain Prabhupāda's challenges, RM makes a long speech.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The first thing is he's talking for too long, and you're missing the point. It's getting confusing. Ask him, first of all, to speak a little shorter. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he said, what he's suggesting is that first of all, we'd be better off not giving it some kind of concrete form because he thinks ultimately the silence is the best answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let him learn that. If silence is best, then don't talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, he says, still, we can give it some form for discussion purposes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is his silence? Silence means don't talk. If you prefer silence, then don't talk. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He suggests, "Well, In that case, if we're going to discuss the Absolute Truth, then you can say that the ultimate is..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he raised that Absolute Truth is non-dual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Non-dual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Tat tvam asi.</span> He's saying, "We are that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then, then why he raised the question of Absolute Truth, non-dualism, <span class="Italic">neti neti?</span> This is the discussion of Absolute Truth. So why he says, "For the time being, let us become silent"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, he's saying... Oh, it's hard. In other words, he's saying, "Let's get rid of everything that's not the Absolute Truth, and not talk about actually what is the Absolute Truth yet."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yeah, that's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He's just saying, "Let's get rid of..." (to RM:) You understand a little English? "Let's get rid of this bad situation, let's get rid of this bad situation, and let's not talk about really what the truth is yet because we don't know. Let's be silent about that. Let's just work to get rid of the bad elements." This is how he's trying to practice his philosophy. In other words, if there is this political problem here, let's get rid of this, and let's get rid of this one, but let's not talk about what actually the goal is yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> Then he said that... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just for example, he says that Kṛṣṇa was urging Arjuna to fight. He says, well, that fight has two meanings. One is the historic sense, and the other one is that it's a struggle inside ourselves to get freed of all of the bad situations, to get free of our false ego, to get free of our pride.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The question is "What is he aiming at?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless we understand that what is his aim of discussion, then how we can make progress? (Yogeśvara mentions something in French about Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna) No, why you are bringing Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna? First of all, let us know what is the aim of our discussion, the subject matter of discussion. (French for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> His main point when he quotes <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is to show that it is a philosophy of action, it is dynamic, that Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna to fight. So there was a war. It is dynamics, not just sentiment, philosophy. It is active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yeah. <span class="Italic">Neti, neti.</span> Getting rid of the bad elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is practical, practical action. Yes. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he says, "Therefore we're coming back to our original point of discussion which is that real religion is not a question of a man's motives, but it's a question of his actions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "What it motivates, what does a man do, how his religion is lived. That's a point."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we are preaching. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are not sitting idly and smoking <span class="Italic">gāñjā.</span> It is not like that. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So what he's saying is that, "Yes, in this connection, I can compliment you (Śrīla Prabhupāda) for the work that you are doing because," from what he has experienced, "most of the people who are coming from India to preach about Kṛṣṇa, talk about Kṛṣṇa to old people or people who actually don't have any use for Hinduism or spirituality except as a kind of diversion or a drug."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So I think, if I understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I agree. I agree. He's right. He's right. He's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He wasn't appreciating exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Did he appreciate? First of all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He doesn't appreciate what we are doing exactly. He says, he says, with his Indian, with his Indian, what he's doing with his Indian, what is the name of it...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Francend. (Name of paper?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> Franscend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> Franscend. He says there is many swami and writer come from India and teach to the people, to the western people, what is Kṛṣṇa, what is Indian philosophy, what is God, but they always teach the people who need to be safe, to be, who need something to be safe, and they take it like just a drug or some kind of a dream just to get something to get safe from the material world. But that doesn't mean their action is concrete. That is his point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are not doing that. We are, in the material world, we are teaching Kṛṣṇa philosophy, practicing. All these young men, they are actually twenty-four hours engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are different from them. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He thinks that the people in western world, mostly now they take Indian religion, some religion or philosophy come from India, because the Christian philosophy has some defect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says the religions that come from India are infinitely richer than the religion we know in the West. And we cannot see only one aspect. He says there is so many faces in Indian religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In... The idea of philosophy and religion, that is originated from India. There is no doubt about it. And that original idea of philosophy is practically demonstrated by Kṛṣṇa. The ideal original ideal of religion and philosophy is preached by Kṛṣṇa. And all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> followed that. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He said that is the distinction between the dogmatic aspect between the Hindu religions and the western religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What is that? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says the western or the Christian religion are marked by dogmatists and they are very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> And they have imperialist conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that western religions are narrow-minded, that they don't have the openness that the religions of the East have in India, for example. And that the West has this capitalist, imperialistic tendency which is also supported by its religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. First... Therefore I asked what does he mean by religion. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says we can't say... His point is we can't say something. There is so many aspects of religion. There is the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> by love and by heart. There is the <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> by action. There's <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga,</span> by knowledge. He says if in western countries, we propagate <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> we take the risk of using <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> like a drug or something like this, if you are dreaming or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> by drugs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says, he made the statement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> ...according to the state of the French people, in right now, in this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we do not prescribe drug. We ask them to give up drug. (laughter) (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> What he's questioning, Prabhupāda, is whether or not <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is suitable for everyone in every instance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the only yoga meant for the human being. Any other yoga system practiced, they're against <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga's</span> an escape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> brings to escaping one's responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he does not know what is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> He does not know. (French) Arjuna did not escape. He was trying to escape, but, by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> he was captured. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He says it's a work which is very, very practical and rational.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore that is real <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said that <span class="Italic">Anu-gītā</span> is also a very practical work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No <span class="Italic">Anu-gītā. Anu-gītā</span> is also another rebellious condition. <span class="Italic">Bhakti, Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. That is required. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that the great choice of scriptures from India allows us to choose like that. We can choose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can choose, but if you do not know how to choose, what is the meaning of your choosing? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says he choose Radhakrishnan, he choose all the <span class="Italic">seigneur...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they, all of them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He reject Aurobindo...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I understand. All of them, they make center Kṛṣṇa. So why not take Kṛṣṇa? (French) Now this Ramakrishna said, "I am the same Kṛṣṇa." So if we give respect to Ramakrishna because of his being the same Kṛṣṇa, why not go to the same Kṛṣṇa directly? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says it's not the full conclusion. And he says he says he can take another way and it excludes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Siddheshvarananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> That's another... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you cannot... If he was referring to Kṛṣṇa, if you are referring to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> so why don't you take it originally? (French) [break] (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, he says this is the answer from Ramakrishna. When you have a thorn in your foot, you take another thorn and pluck it out, and afterwards, you throw them both away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> does not say. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that "You surrender unto Me, and sustain this." Therefore he has misled. He did not understand what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and he misled so many fools. That is his business. One thing is, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> And Ramakrishna says that "You can accept any path." So this is against <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, of the two choices, he likes Ramakrishna's better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his choice. But if he says that "I am the same Kṛṣṇa," why should he differ? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says to accommodate, to accommodate them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No accommodation. No. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> and Ramakrishna says that "Whatever path you select, it is all right." So it is completely against <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> principles. And, and he said... His name was Gadadhara Chatterjee. So at the time of his death, he declared to Vivekananda that "I am the same Kṛṣṇa, I am the same Rāma." So they believed in that, without any evidence, and they started this Ramakrishna mission. This is the history. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that he recognizes that, and he says it is one interpretation, as you have your interpretation, as there are many. He doesn't think that these interpretations are as important as the art of knowing how to live, which is, he thinks, the essence of all religion, how to live. He says the interpretation is not so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he thinks Ramakrishna lived very well than others? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I think one... If I've understood, he's insisting on one point. That is the that the public opinion is actually the most important thing, just as this Ramakrishna expressed the spirit of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> in a way that was most popular, was most favorable to the public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that public? Amongst you, who accepts Ramakrishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says as same as Gandhi. A different type, but at their time, at their own time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yeah, but Prabhupāda's questioning the presumption of this generalization. He said that a majority of the public have accepted Ramakrishna's comments on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but what public? Where's the specifics of that generalization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He said and then Gandhi gave another interpretation that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Amongst the scholars and the true Vedic authorities in India, they don't accept Ramakrishna at all. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> It is difficult word to translate in English. He says at his time, Ramakrishna's was the expression of the mass of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> What mass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Ramakrishna's popular in the West because of his skillful propaganda... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that "Well, in a sense, we have to accept that Ramakrishna was expressing the sentiments of the public because he lived amongst the public."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is his false understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Still, that doesn't make it valid. Hitler, Hitler lived amongst the public too. And he was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'll give you example that mass of people in Jagannātha Purī, in Vṛndāvana, many thousands, ten thousands, twenty thousands people, every day come, to worship Jagannātha, to worship Kṛṣṇa, but there is a Ramakrishna temple in Belurmath, or somewhere else-nobody goes. So how do you say the mass of people are attracted to Ramakrishna? And similarly, recently, our foreign students went to Vṛndāvana, went to Navadvīpa, by thousands, but nobody goes to Ramakrishna Mission temple. Then other point: Ramakrishna Mission is working in the western world almost one hundred years. Find out their disciples so many we have got. So your statement, "It is meant for the mass of people," it is false. I have given you proof from India and from here also. That means throughout the whole world. In India nobody cares for Ramakrishna. That I have given you proof. You go to Vṛndāvana. There nobody cares for Ramakrishna. You go to Jagannātha Purī, Haridvar, so many holy places. Nobody cares for Ramakrishna. So your idea, that it is for the mass, it is false. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says he was talking about the time of Ramakrishna, when Ramakrishna was there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, everything, bubble comes and goes away. It is no meaning. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says numbers aren't really very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> It's not a proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's not a proof, just numbers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says: But that's not a proof, just to say that there are greater number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> He was trying to submit it as a proof just a minute ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, sometimes he is going this side, sometimes goes that side. Sometimes he says, "Mass of people," and again he says, "Not the number of people." What is mass of people? That is the number of people. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says, for example, he can see the mass of people in Italy, they are Catholic. But that doesn't mean he's going to be impressed by the Catholic philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, now, we have to... He was comparing that the mass of people, they take to Ramakrishna. That I have proved. They're not, the mass of people, not at all interested... That I have proved. That is my answer. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He said he was not saying that thousands of people were following Ramakrishna...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the mass of people mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says Ramakrishna, whether he knew it or not, he was expressing a sentiment of the people at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time. That is finished. So that is not permanent settlement. But Kṛṣṇa's, Kṛṣṇa's, I mean to say, supremacy, at least for the last five thousand years, is intact. Now, he says Aurobindo, Gandhi, Ramakrishna. They're all gone. They came and gone. But Kṛṣṇa philosophy is truth, and it is standing, and it will go on standing. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says it's not the person important in this example. It's the idea they was expressing, all from five thousand years. The same idea was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, same idea. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam: [SB </span>1.3.28] "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." That idea is accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, he's saying that Aurobindo and Ramakrishna expressed that same idea in contemporary language in their own time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that existed temporarily. Now it is gone. That will not appeal. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, what he's suggesting is that that's not actually an argument because the important thing is that there were times, at different times, different people have come and have attempted or have actually represented the public sentiment. They have become the epitome or resume' or synthesis of the public sentiment at a particular period. In other words, he's saying the great reform..., the great preachers, they've always been representatives of people; instead of being representatives of Kṛṣṇa, or God, they've been the representatives of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people's representative is different from God's representative. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that "Well, that's a belief." You have to believe that. He said that's only a belief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, people change according to the time, circumstances, they change. Their opinion has no value. We don't give any value to the people's opinion. We give value to the Supreme Being's opinion. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that that's dangerous because then we run the risk of having people who say, "Well, I represent the word of God. I can give you the true interpretation of the word of God, and they're actually only interested personal, private interests..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if... If people... Not all. If there is actually opinion of God, if one man says the same opinion, then how others can say that "You all not giving God's opinion." God said, Kṛṣṇa said, that "You surrender to Me," and if I say that "You surrender to God," then how I am deviating from God's instruction? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, what you're saying is that, in essence we must stick to the words of God without interpreting." (aside:) Is that what he said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That's it. That we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> (to translators:) You should repeat your point that you make sure he understands. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you interpret, then the God's authority is denied. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says there is some deviation, some interpretation by some philosophers or sages. They deviate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who deviates is not a sage. He's a thief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> Yeah, it's what he says. I'm just translating his words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if he deviates from the words of God, then he is not a sage. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, well, the thing that he appreciates in Hinduism is its openness and its tolerance to so many different paths and so many different interpretations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. But to abide by the orders of God, that is another thing. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says then we've made the full turn again. We've come back to the beginning. (French) He said so we've actually come back to the beginning of our discussion again which is that real religion has to be judged by the actions of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that you can judge. Here is the action of the men. Now the young men and boys and girls are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And who is taking to Ramakrishna? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So he is a man of action, and here we have a movement of action which is solving all problems of the world. What's his complaint? It's not a dream. It's actually by following this movement, we're solving all problems. So what does he have to say? If he follows exactly what Kṛṣṇa says, then all the problems will be solved. So why doesn't he follow what Kṛṣṇa says? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He received information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He received information that to follow, with some interest, that to follow what Kṛṣṇa says and like that, we can solve problems. (French) And personally, he respects you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. That's all right. But thing is that we must know that he has spoken about Ramakrishna and Aurobindo. They also center their propaganda on Kṛṣṇa. Just like I already told. Ramakrishna said, "I am the same Krishna." That means he takes to Kṛṣṇa. Aurobindo, he has written "Life Divine." That is his explanation of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He takes to Kṛṣṇa. This Maharishi, he has also presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā;</span> he (has) taken to Kṛṣṇa. So their importance is by taking to Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, they are valueless, nobody. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that for him, that's not really a problem. He says rather than referring to the person Kṛṣṇa, he just goes directly to the teaching of the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> and he profits from that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> means Kṛṣṇa. That is the folly of the so-called scholars. They want to study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> without Kṛṣṇa. Just like one wants to play Hamlet without Hamlet. (French, mentions Śaṅkara) Śaṅkara has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Does he know that, that Śaṅkara has accepted Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Personality? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So his point is that, well, ultimately, the, now what is going to happen, he says, is we're going to get into a discussion about whether or not the Supreme is a person or impersonal, and he says he doesn't really have the time to get into that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Then? What did he...? Why he come here? What for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We invited him. (laughter) (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, at the end of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He says, "Give up all this religiousness, and surrender to Me." The whole purport of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He's telling Arjuna to fight, but ultimately in the end, He's saying, "Just forget about all these ideas you have in your head, and surrender to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Me" means Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then Kṛṣṇa is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām ekam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">mām ekam,</span> "only to Me." (French) So anyone who has studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> rightly, he'll do that, surrender to Kṛṣṇa. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he accepts that as being... He says that's an opinion, just like there are many other opinions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that is an opinion, just as there are so many other opinions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this opinion is followed by all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This is Kṛṣṇa's opinion. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India's culture, India's culture depends on the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Just like Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Śaṅkarācārya, Nimbārka, Viṣṇu Svāmī, like that. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam.</span> So India's culture is still, up to date, it is followed by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Anyone you find in India who claims to become a Hindu, he must have followed the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> So all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says all the Christians and all the priests, that they tell to him from, that from two thousand years, the truth is in the Evangel. But still, he says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just like we're saying that all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have accepted Kṛṣṇa, he says so also in the Christian religion, all the priests and all the Christians have said that Christ is the ultimate, as it is said in the Evangel. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we have several times explained that Christ says that he is the son of God. So we don't deny it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The point he's making, Prabhupāda, is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> What he's saying is that outwardly, they all profess allegiance to Jesus, but they, it's seen that they disagree with one another on many points. They have diversified opinions about what Jesus meant about this and what does life signify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> And therefore, for him, he doesn't even consider that question, whether Christ is the son of God, whether he's not the son of God. For him, it's a secondary problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, now, what is his problem. That he did never disclose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, he says the problem is the art of living, what is the best way to live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has got his opinion. I have got my own opinion. How we'll agree? We say that you remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everything will be solved. Does he agree? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, "No, absolutely not. Just like I don't accept the existence..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why shall I agree to his point? (French) So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he says, "So I have to leave now. But the last thing I'd like to say is that I reject that conclusion just like I reject also the Christian conclusion that the truth is in the Evangel. But," he says, "that doesn't impede me, that doesn't stop me from working very nicely with some of my best friends who are Christians when it comes down to practical work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is his opinion? That he never disclosed. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> But what practical thing is he doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> What he says, what he says... He's not Christian. He's actually, he's atheist and he's materialist. But he says he guides the people to read the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> because he says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there's something more than in the Evangel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we say also same thing. So where is the disagreement? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He says that in his political work, he teaches sometimes <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and people are very interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he is the only Communist to suggest to people that they read the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we recommend everyone to read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> (French) What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He says that when he explains <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> or presents <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> to people, he doesn't tell them that "This is the word of God and you just have to accept it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he has not studied himself <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That means he has not studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he says that he thinks the same about us, that we are also not understanding perfectly <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let him understand from us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No, he says he thinks that we don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> (Simultaneously with Yogeśvara) He thinks that we don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that he thinks that we have imperfectly understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us discuss who understands, you or me. So who will decide? You are understanding or I am understanding-who'll decide? Who will decide it? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So if he is a man of action, let us see. He has got his philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We have got our philosophy. Let us see by the results whose action is doing things. We have no political problem, we have no economic problem, we have no social problem. What more action does he want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religious problem. Any problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No problem. So what does that indicate? And you have all problems. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this question... Listen. Our Bhagavān says that he has no problem. We have no problem. And you have got all problems. So who is better? Who is better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And anyone who joins us loses all his problems. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says then that's very serious because if you have no problems, that means you are trying to escape from the world because the world is full of problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are in the Paris City. How we have escaped from the world? (laughter) We have got branches in London, in Paris in New York and big, big cities, and all these boys are coming from big, big cities. How they have escaped? It is not justice. If he says that "They have escaped," that is wrong statement. We are not escaping anything. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What kind of proof are you looking for? Let's talk about proof. What kind of proof are you looking for? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, another point is he's accusing us that we're escaping. Why he's escaping Kṛṣṇa consciousness? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he thinks that what we're doing is simply a kind of medicine that doesn't actually resolve the problems that people are facing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is not result, then how this boy says, "We have no problem"? The patient says that he is cured, and you say that it is not curing? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> (to translators) So repeat to Prabhupāda what he said. (French) We have proof that anyone from any part of the world who takes to this process loses his problems. It's not a matter of western or eastern. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> With your permission, he would like to take leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? He should stay with us. Let us conclude. Why you are flying away? We have started one discussion. Let it be finished. Why you are going away? (French) That means he is escaping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says because he works in the evenings. He's a theater critic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Some way or other, he's escaping. (French) A man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> With pleasure, he would like to come back to finish the discussion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> And with friendship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes. That's it. Don't escape. (French) When we have begun the discussion, let us finish. Don't escape. Thank you. <span class="Italic">Haribol. Jaya.</span> Thank you. (R.M. leaves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Make sure he has some more <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> before he goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> I'll bring it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Hmm, open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> (to devotees outside room) ...Prabhupāda is very tired. He's just finished a long evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when there is discussion, you should all be present. It is very interesting. Those who are our men, GBC men, they must know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They come in like Keśī demon, and they go out with <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in their mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are escaping. We are not escaping. We want to capture everyone. (laughter) He has no clear idea what is the aim of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He likes to see people engaged in work that is humanitarian, that will resolve the problems of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That everyone says. All rascals says like that. Humanitarian. He does not know what is humanitarian. And then killing one capitalist or communist and this and that. Sophistry. Fascist and communist. This is their humanitarian work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's like one of these rascals who translates the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in a certain way like saying the five Pāṇḍavas are the five senses, and the battlefield is the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And here we're having a fight with the body, but he doesn't accept that Kṛṣṇa is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their only business is to escape Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They're trying to interpret that Kṛṣṇa is just our own intelligence or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The point is even when they see the practical proof, they don't accept it. They're so stubborn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You be strong. Don't be... They cannot conquer us. But you be more strong. (end)</div>
