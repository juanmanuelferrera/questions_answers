<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is giving the tree food, huh? (Hindi) What is the answer? Who gives them food?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Kṛṣṇa is giving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these rascals they cannot understand. They are making economic development. They have no program for economic development. How they're eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, they're not in very good shape either. I mean they have to stand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are also in not very good shape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I can put on a coat. They're standing out in the cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) In your country nobody likes white, they have begun to tan. So you are not (in) good shape in consideration of ladies. (chuckling) How you can say that it is not in good shape? It has got another lady to appreciate. You may not appreciate. One man, lady, may not appreciate your beauty but that does not mean you are not beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caitya-guru:</span> It says <span class="Italic">ulu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caitya-guru:</span> Name of that tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Ulu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Sometimes the trees just die because there's not sufficient . . .</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not the standard that you do not like somebody, therefore he is not liked by others. That is not very good argument. That is applicable everywhere. The point is that it is a living entity, it so stout and strong, who is giving him food? That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, my argument was sometimes he's not being supplied the proper way so therefore economic development is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alright. That is your... Out of 8,400,000 forms of life, the economic development is taken, a few only. Why others they're developing without any economy? There are so many other living entities</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well for example, the bees or the ants, they're, the bees are making hives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They are developing a big bee-hive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is collection of food. The trees also do that. They are called <span class="Italic">pāda-pa. Pāda-pa</span> means they drink water by the legs. You drink water by the mouth and they drink water by the legs. <span class="Italic">Pāda-pa.</span> Just like the, what is called? Bats. They pass stool through the mouth. Is it not? You do not know this? Yes. (laughter) You'll find the bats, they are hanging down the head, and they're passing stool. Sometimes man also does so, when there is strangulation. That is very dangerous disease. What is called? Intestine strangulation. Then passing stool through the mouth. In Bengal sometimes they curse, "You'll pass stool through the mouth!" Yes, sometimes they do. Sometimes they eat through the rectum. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They inject glucose through the rectum. There are many varieties of life. That is the fault of the modern rascals. They want to compare with himself, everything. They do not know that in the God's kingdom there are varieties of life. Otherwise why the 8,400,000? There are varieties. What these rascals know about these varieties? <span class="Italic">Ātmavat manyate jagat.</span> They think, "Everyone should be like me." (sound of crows in background) Now these birds, within a second, goes hundred feet high. You cannot do. This is variety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But the bird is always looking for food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is looking, that is another thing. But food is there. He has no arrangement for making industry. (to passer-by) Hare Kṛṣṇa! He has no arrangement for making industry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, that's why he always has to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their food is there, he is simply searching out, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So if we economically develop, we don't even have to search out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you are opening factories. They are not opening factories. Nature's food is already there. And "Be satisfied, take this." That's all. That much endeavour is required. That is material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So in other words he has to look for food, but man has to make a factory in order to look for food...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he hasn't got to make factory. He has got also food but he... If he does, he is claiming to be more civilized. He has complicated his activities by opening factories. That's all. He has got also food. Let everyone remain in nature's... You take fruit from the trees and drink milk, you are also sufficient. You don't require to cook even. There are fruits. Formerly all the sages they were taking fruits from the trees, and milk from the cows. That's all. They did not even produce food. Like agriculture. No. Whatever nature is supplying, that's all. But you are killing the cows, eating the meat, and producing no food and and making things, complicated. This is your civilization. (a car accelerates past)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's a lot of fun to drive fast cars and have sex and see movies and... This is fun you know. It's the only way to enjoy!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Enjoyment is there in the cats and dogs. When you enjoy sex in palace and the dog enjoys sex on the street, the value is the same. The taste does not increase or decrease. But you are thinking to enjoy sex in big palace is advancement. That is your foolishness. Actually sex enjoyment in the palace or on the street is the same. It has no difference of taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So then we can have sex on the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are going to have that, next life! (laughter) Because you are desiring, you will get this life. Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your desire. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante māyā... [Bg. </span>4.11].<span class="Italic"> Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> Kṛṣṇa is within you. You are thinking that I will be very much happy if I enjoy sex like the dog. Kṛṣṇa notes, and next life, "My dear friend here is the body. You enter and enjoy." <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe... [Bg. 18.61].</span> He is noting down your desire. <span class="Italic">Hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati. Māyayā brāhmayan sarva-bhūtāni, yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> This is clearly explained. Alright, you want the enjoyment like dog, here is. Remembrance is also there. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> You wanted to enjoy sex like a dog. Now I have given you this body, now you enjoy. Everything is there, arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but dogs they have to lead a pretty miserable life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have also, you have got, not living very happy life, this human society. There are others, even Indira Gandhi, she's always disturbed. Who is happy here? I saw personally. Oh, she is so disturbed. Everyone is unhappy. Who is happy here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I mean, you say that to anybody in America, they'll go, "I'm happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is unhappy, America, India, god or beast everyone is unhappy. <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya, bhaya</span> means fearfulness. That is unhappiness. Everyone is afraid what will happen next. This is unhappiness. So either you be Indira Gandhi or a street dog, that is nature's law. Nobody is happy. That they cannot understand that there is no happiness, and he's trying to make development for happiness. Actually there is no happiness. This is struggle for existence. <span class="Italic">Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati [Bg.<b class="calibre4"> </b></span>15.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> with the mind and the senses he's trying for happiness, but there is no happiness. That is called illusion. That is called illusion. There is no happiness and he's trying to get happiness. Happiness is beyond the senses, material senses. <span class="Italic">Sukham atyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyam grāhyam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.21]<span class="Italic">,</span> if you want real happiness that is transcendental happiness, not this sense happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But there is happiness of the senses. When you have sex life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When... Happiness there is, not for the rascals, but for the intelligent. Happiness there is. Unless there is happiness, how we are seeking for happiness? Unless there is immortality, how we are seeking for immortality? There is. But the way in which you are seeking for these things, that is wrong. That is the whole education. <span class="Italic">Māyā muni sthitaḥ.</span> Just like a foolish animal, he is seeking water from the desert because it appears there is water. But that is his foolishness. A human being he knows that there is no water, it is all sand. That is the difference between animal and human being. Therefore if the dog sees another, what is called? He makes a dog in the water, and he thinks another dog carrying a bread and he wants to take it away, so his bread goes away</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's a perfect example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He loses his own bread and there is no other bread. That's all. (Sanskrit) The lion he thought there is another lion within the well, and jumped over it. He lost his life, that's all. This going on. So, he's so strong, lion, it is fabulously strong, but he's animal. In spite of so much strength, he's an animal. Similarly this modern civilization, in spite of so much so-called advancement, they are simply animals. That's all. A big animal is eulogized by another small animal, that's all. Animal is animal, big animal or small. (pointing out on the road) Just see he hasn't got master, and what is his condition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Pretty bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> If anyone depends on the master's mercy, he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Here in New Delhi, these big, big buildings, big, big officers, as soon as the government will fail, they will be street dogs, that's all. Now they are plundering, by official instrument. Now when the government will be finished, they will be street dog. That's all. This is your civilization. Immediately if all of a sudden there is attack in New Delhi, all the people will starve. There is no food at all, and they'll die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's a really important point that the government takes more and more, and everybody gets poorer and poorer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The government is also poor because they do not know how to govern. <span class="Italic">Buddhi yasya balaṁ tasya.</span> If one has got intelligence he has got strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Change of government means getting poorer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A change of government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Change of government... Just like they say, a change of theories by the rascals. Change means rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But as soon as a government changes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything change means it is the domain of rascals, pandemonium. Just like in <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> it is said that, <span class="Italic">nāsyāṁ svatantratām arhati,</span> women should not be given independence. Once said, that is fact. If you want to change, you suffer. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Any deviation from absolute law means immediately suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bas,</span> immediately you have to suffer. (reads sign on building) DTS, what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> German Democratic Republic. German diplomat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> German Embassy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> This is going to be the Punjab Bhavan. For the Punjab state government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You're painting a pretty bleak picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paint picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The one you're painting of society, and the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's no hope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Unless they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no hope, that's a fact. There will be more chaotic condition and everyone will suffer and perish. <span class="Italic">Āchinna-dāra-draviṇā gacchanti giri-kānanam.</span> This is already predcited. I am not painting. It is already there, I am simply repeating. That's all. I am not speculator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually most of them are aware that they're in a very bad position. Everybody is expecting another war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just see. This is capitol of India. This is the position. We can know, understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The problem is in America, it all looks so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are not yet so poverty-stricken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You ask anyone, tell anyone this in America, they'll go, "Oh well we've had difficult times in the past, but we've always pulled out of it." Like the Depression. They always quote the Depression of the thirties. The Depression and they say then there was the war and everything became better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the academy? Nonsense. They are spending so much money in this <span class="Italic">kala-kendra,</span> academy, this, that. And no place for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just see. Such a cultural book of knowledge. There is no such institution, <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> instruction, institute. No. This <span class="Italic">kala bhavan,</span> this <span class="Italic">kendra bhavan</span> this... They have got so many dance <span class="Italic">bhavan,</span> and when Kṛṣṇa dances with the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> "Ah, that is bad!" The rascals, they do not understand where you have got this tendency for dancing. Because it is there in Kṛṣṇa. That they do not understand. Kṛṣṇa dancing is bad, and my dancing is very good. They will put so many questions, "Why Kṛṣṇa dance with others' wives." "And why your are dancing with others wife, fall-down." Just see. Kṛṣṇa's dancing is mythology and his dancing is fact. Although His life is mythology (indistinct). (laughter) (indistinct) Rabindra Bhavan. What they are doing? Such a big house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Aravindra Bhavan</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? This is Aurobindo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> This is Ravindra Bhavan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is written there? Ravindra. Ravindra's Gate. Ravindra's gate is, how to enjoy illicit sex. This is his gate. He introduced <span class="Italic">māgha-melā,</span> inviting young boys and girls to dance together. And taking this opportunity, he was enjoying young girls. That was his purpose. They would come, the young girls would come, Ravindra (Bengali), grandfather, and he'll, "Alright you sit down on my lap." That's all. This is Ravindra Bhavan, to become debauch. And if you teach young man debauchery, he can attract millions. There is no doubt of it. The pride(?) philosophy. Hm? Debauchery. Allow sex without any discrimination. (observes passing hand drawn cart) Economic development. Where is economic development for these men? There, when there was no economic development, the same <span class="Italic">taila</span> and poor people with black cloth was there, and now the same thing is still there, so where is development?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> It's increasing actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature's law you cannot check. It must go on. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">. Bhāgavata</span> says, "Don't try to improve all these things, it is not possible. Improve your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That will be benefit for your life." (sees another sign) Sangeet (indistinct). Means you can dance. And when our men dance, what do they call? Crazy, crazy. (reads signs) Śrī Rāma. Śrī Rāma for art and culture. So arrange dancing in this Sangeet dance, here. (laughter) They'll not allow? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Their idea of dancing is different to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you, you sell tickets for ten rupees, then they'll (indistinct). If you make free then they'll...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caitya-guru:</span> International dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why don't you try? Just see. I think they allow dancing by renting the halls, no? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Which one? That Kamani Hall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any one. This one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> They have performances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they sell tickets. So similar way, why not ours? [break] Enquire from the authority that we want to hold festival, dance and chant. And singing, don't say chant. See if you can dance, for one week. So what will be the terms. Enquire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> The Supra House, I enquired before, so they want about five or six hundred rupees per day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that's alright! Five, six hundred, suppose if we continue for one week, they may reduce. Hm? Even five hundred, then we pay one week about 3,500, so why that LA... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> LIC grounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That is 50,000, 60,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> There is one big Vijñāna Bhavan. Three thousand people can sit there. Should I organize like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> For when the devotees come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> It is better than <span class="Italic">Ram līlā</span> grounds. We'll get the educated and sophisticated people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Not just the Old Delhi people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> And we can make very good... In the newspaper, if we get, then we'll get... We can sell the tickets also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you attend all these Kala Bhavan. Utilize like that way. You will have always engagement. This our chanting, dancing, <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution. And they will pay also. We'll sell books. Why don't you take advantage of this institution? It requires organisation, that's all. Why LIC grounds, so much money? Three thousand daily and 40,000 monthly and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> So much endeavor also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so much endeavor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> This Vijñāna Bhavan we can get, it's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it! Am I right or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Programs like that would work very successfully in the west also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And what is three thousand, four thousand? You get two members and it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> No. People will contribute. No problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Do it immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Should I make that for March?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Why March? Immediately! Try for immediately. Every week there must be some festival. Hm. In that way you don't require a very gigantic house. We can live anywhere, but our propagation will go on. [break] So many <span class="Italic">bhavans</span> and so many institutions, utilise them. And there will be concession, if we take for one week, two weeks. They will give concession. Sometimes they may give free also. When they understand this is nice movement. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...is starting to sell, to make more money. It's not very big (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He has done a mistake so he wants to rectify it. He wants to bring money, (chuckles) but if the money is lost, it is lost, let him come back. What is there? A life saved is more important than save the money. So if I could know the address... (to passerby) Hare Kṛṣṇa! Then I could write.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Well, we can... Revatīnandana, I think is staying in the, by Los Angeles, right near San Diego. San Diego or... I thinks it's San Diego or that other one, Laguṇa Beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I wanted to write him a letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Revatīnandana might be able to give you the address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (greets a man in Hindi) <span class="Italic">Jaya! Ha. Vṛndāvana hogya.</span> No, if you know Revatīnandana's address, he can forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, he can forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Śyāmasundara told me that he wanted to make millions of dollars for you so that he could...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (chuckles) And I am thinking when making millions of dollars, he may not be lost.
