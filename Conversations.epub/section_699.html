<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa (in car):</span> But still they come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, out of curiosity only, not to accept your proposition. "What this Swamiji is speaking?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, you asked them, "So why don't you surrender? What is your objection?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Objection is that they will not be allowed to drink tea. That is objection. No cigarette, no even tea. They think it is impossible. All, they are Indian house. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some live upstairs here. But all of these people who are living in this area have to move out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Businesses, for now they can stay. They try to push them out, though, all the time. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sahajananda has written very frankly that "All the swamis and yogis are deriding Kṛṣṇa. You are the only person pushing on Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world, single-handedly."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has very much appreciated this effort. Everyone will do that. I am the single man, speaking of God. Nobody speaks. All big, big leaders, politicians, philoso..., who is speaking of God? We are stressing only, God consciousness. As soon as you speak of God, "Oh, it is old-fashioned to bring in God. These are primitive. Now we speak of science. There is no God. That is very nice." As soon as you speak of God, "Oh, you are useless. You have no advanced knowledge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are challenging, then, the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are challenging the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no authority. And Vivekananda said, "You manufacture your own God, whomever you like. Even you can worship stool as God." They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now the Indian government-if this is true-they are giving visas to the devotees, and that means they are favorable towards the movement more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It may be due to my interview with Indira Gandhi. I appealed to her that "No Indians are joining, and these Europeans, Americans, they are helping me. And if they are asked to go away, then how shall I maintain the establishment? Indians are not coming." So they might have studied that "They are not politician, and this movement... Everyone will appreciate God consciousness. They are doing something," this consideration. Otherwise it is surprising. They have given three years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It is very surprising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very, very surprising. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There may be some more information to come about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't know, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Navayogendra is not the official source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Navayogendra, yes, why Navayogendra has said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think he wants to remind you of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because it is coming from Navayogendra it is not to be relied so much. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There should be mail there. There should be some more information, for sure. But then sometimes I think it's simply Kṛṣṇa's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, by Kṛṣṇa's grace...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here in South Africa is very, very conservative government, and we've been allowed to do practically everything. Simply Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Yogamāyā allows our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> activities to go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who will read our books, he will come to senses. These are all Indian quarters? [break] ...haven't got any good temple till now. [break] ...Africans, they do not live either with Indians or Europeans. They live separately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Live separately. But usually every Indian or European has one or two Africans living behind the house as servants, so there are many living in the cities. We have one African girl in Johannesburg. She works at the temple. We've called her Pārijāta. We have one African girl because when we first came there were only a few of us and we didn't want to take up time to clean up the temple for our preaching work. So she has to get up very early in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She was paid for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it facilitated our preaching work. At first, I was against the idea, but I found it was good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was not good to give, keep young unmarried girl.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> She is married with children. She is older. Her husband was murdered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, in Johannesburg. We didn't pick any young African girl, older lady and very respectful, honest. She's about fifty years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Her husband was walking home one day, and African killed him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just for money. (end)</div>
