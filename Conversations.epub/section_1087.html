<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I have just come from America, and at the universities, lots of times there are many questions concerning evolution and I was curious about what our position is in terms of artifacts. Bones like dinosaur bones and things like that that the scientists say they found.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists are rascals. Those who are following Darwin. What is their theory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They maintain that from the oceans came one-celled animals. Then from these one-celled animals, they developed into fish and then reptiles. And then these reptiles became very big dinosaurs, and they have put together many big museums. For instance, in Washington the Smithsonian Museum has many, many big bones put together and they date these millions of years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have got also the same theory. <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.</span> [break] ...within water. So where is the difference? We also admit the forms of life begins from the ocean. Then plants. As soon as the water is dried, there are plants, trees. <span class="Italic">Sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati. Sthāvara</span> means "the life which cannot move." So the trees, plants, grass, they cannot move. Then insects, then reptiles, then birds, then beast, then human being. In this way the living entity is changing body. So what is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But they say that the human body developed right from these other bodies. In other words...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Evolution, from beast human body has come. That is the difference? Even there is difference, what is the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, they maintain that therefore man was not created by God, but simply by chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascals! Wherefrom the life came first? Wherefrom the life came from? When you find life in the water, wherefrom this life came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say originally it came from chemicals that came together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal! Create from chemicals. Otherwise, beat them with shoes in their mouth. Why you talk nonsense? Create from chemicals, life. [break] What do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say they're working on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then be beaten with shoes. When you're successful, then say. Otherwise, I shall beat you with shoes. That's all. That is your punishment. You have not come to the experimental stage, and you are talking, "This is science." Science is experiment and observation. Unless the experiment is practical, practical science... It will be accepted as science when the experiment is successful. Not before that. That is scientific method. First of all, observe. It may be happening like this. But that "maybe" should be confirmed by experiment. Then it is science. Even in colleges there is practical examination. Theoretical and practical. So unless... "We are trying." Everyone will say, "I am trying." "I am trying to become millionaire." When you become millionaire, then say that you are millionaire. You are trying for becoming millionaire and you say, "I am millionaire." What is this nonsense? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. No one has ever observed the life coming from matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just prove that life comes from chemicals. How is that? "I am trying to be millionaire, therefore I am millionaire." What is this nonsense? You are trying to create from chemicals. Therefore you are scientist. What's this kind of scientist? Beat them with shoes. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> I have a researcher in our family, and he thinks the theory of evolution is the <span class="Italic">daśa-avatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can think like that. Your thinking has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, not my thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't say, "I am thinking."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I said I have a researcher in my family, he thinks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What research? He's a rascal also!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but he thinks the <span class="Italic">daśa-avatāra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "He thinks," means he's a rascal. Nothing to be think. It must be from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Is there any evidence in <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that I can look?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The <span class="Italic">daśa-avatāras,</span> that the first was Matsya and then Kūrma and Varāha, and finally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is God's pastime. He becomes like this, like that. It is not evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> God is not so morphic. He's not an animal. Just like we're in this room but we don't become part of the room. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutaśrava:</span> ...so clear, but they refuse to accept it cause if they do then they will have to give up all their nonsense. You make all these things so crystal clear, but they refuse to accept because if they do then they will have to give up all their nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Refusal, let them refuse, and who cares for them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Actually, if they were successful in any experiment they would be out of a job. So they actually want material life, scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now what is their science? This is science that "We are trying." What is this nonsense science? Do you think this is science? "We are trying." Everyone can say, "I'm trying." Is that science? Then? Any rascal can say that "I am trying." Is that science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha-līlā:</span> I heard that you had quoted a saying that anyone who goes to Laṅkā becomes a Rāvaṇa, and that similarly, when the devotees come to India, they become Rāvaṇa. I wonder if you would explain that or elaborate or explain how we can avoid this sort of thing happening. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask the leaders! I was talking that in all our other branches, our men manage the cooking and kitchen and as soon as they come here, they become <span class="Italic">varalasai.</span> (?) That is Rāvaṇa. Why do they not do here? We have to keep some cook who is neither initiated, nor very clean, a smoker, and we have to keep them. [break] In all other branches, the boys and girls, they manage everything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha-līlā:</span> ...follow the regulations more strictly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have to say again? That means Rāvaṇa. He's asking. I am repeatedly saying that follow, and he's asking. That means he's Rāvaṇa. Why you are inquiring like that. If you know this is the solution, why don't you do it? That means Rāvaṇa. If you know this is the solution, why don't you do it? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutaśrava:</span> ...one week ago and in just four days time the devotees there have distributed over one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of Back To Godhead magazines in just four days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not do here. Huh? That means Rāvaṇa. (laughter) [break] ...to become less intelligent, less active, and therefore I say, <span class="Italic">yāya sei laṅkā sei haya rāvaṇa,(?)</span> "Anyone who comes to Laṅkā, he becomes Rāvaṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Their promotion in local language would be very helpful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in India will purchase English magazine, he knows English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes he knows, but the popularity will be much more in the Hindi and Gujarati and Marathi speaking people, Bengali speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. That is for you, Indians. But you have no time. You are busy with your daughter's marriage, and you simply advise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I am busy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone. Every Indian is busy with his own affair, he'll come and advise. That's all. Advise gratis. But he will not do himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is going... I have got full experience, that Indians, they will come and give some advice, and go away for daughter's marriage. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well there are various types of Indians, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That type of, 99%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Just like 99% of us become lazy when we come to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll advise, but you'll never do it. That is going on. [break] ...elephants dance, and we see. This is Indian policy. These white elephants, they'll come and dance, and you'll see. And you are busy with your daughter's marriage. That's all. [break] ...means <span class="Italic">vairāgya-vidyā. Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 6.254]<span class="Italic">.</span> Nobody can become a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> unless he has disgusted with material life. "I shall do this, I shall do that." And he'll never do <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> That's all. This is not possible. [break] Before leaving my family life I wanted to get my all sons and daughters married, but some of them disagreed, some of them... My wife disagreed. Let them go to hell, I don't care. Time is up. Never mind you are married or not married. Then see your own business. [break] I or you, then who will take care of the marriage of your daughter? Suppose you die immediately? Then who will take care?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> God will give them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you do that now? God will take care. It is called, my Guru Mahārāja used to say, "civil suicide." Civil suicide. Just like if you commit suicide, that is criminal. But this is voluntarily committing suicide. Now I am dead. Whatever you like, you do. So we have to commit civil suicide if we are actually attached to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. That is <span class="Italic">gṛha-dharma.</span> But Kṛṣṇa says, "Give up that." But that attachment is there. I do not think... Suppose I die immediately. Who will take care of my daughter? At that time we say "God." And why not now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That feeling of attachment one has to give up gradually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore we cannot do because the attachment is there. That is the symptom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana</span> will help give up the attachment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore wherever you stay, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will help. <span class="Italic">Thākā ekhana pāiyā.(?)</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, try for the daughter's marriage. That will help. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Civil suicide is a good thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the thought only. Oh, Doctor comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I asked him where you were and he said that you are on the roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi) [break] I do not know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You agreed, huh? (indistinct) is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going within four days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You go, find out what you... and then communicate with you. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you asked me to stay at least a few days.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But you must stay, if you don't stay, you can't stay, I have got not power to keep you. If you will stay, well and good. If you can't even, well I will try our best to inform you what should be done in four days. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let God do whatever He likes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> God will be do it through us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But whatever you do... (laughs) You do not know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever is there is there. Let it remain. They also require some shelter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) Why you are getting swelling or whether weakness of the heart. There are various reasons why did you get the swelling of he leg you know. We must find out by biochemical examination of the internal flesh. Such as the blood, urine, and stool, and put you on the right information. Now if you follow or not is your own sweet will, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nārtasya cāgadam udanvati majjato nauḥ, bālasya neha pitarau śaraṇaṁ nṛsiṁha. Na ārtasya ca agadam.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa never neglects anybody. You have told once so. It is we, our own actions which we, I mean, forget. We get. If you walk too much you get tired. If you sit down you do not. If you walk then there is swelling of the leg, sir. Eh? So it is not Kṛṣṇa. I mean, this is your own saying, eh? I am not manufacturing my own arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">nārtasya cāga...</span> There is no guarantee. But we may try but there is no guarantee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is the play of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that we all know. But so long as we are in <span class="Italic">māyā</span> we have to play our part, haven't we?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is supposition, the pathologist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I am going to bring. That was myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll take blood, he'll take this, he'll take that. So that is another trouble. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, but why should you have a minus on blood? Why should you have minus and whose blood is it? This is your own argument sir, I am very sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How you feel? You are a soul! The body feels, you do not feel. Now we are talking about the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not a liberated person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are liberated soul, we are following you. There are many others, sir otherwise we would not have come behind you. So sir, that is not right. And I think I have got a right to prevail upon you. Have I or have I not? Tell me that, or I'll run away back again. [break] ...its not full. Who knows? We may be liberated in past birth. That is how I come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's fine. That's your process. You are trying to do something for the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see we must know exactly what is happening. After all, science is the same with the <span class="Italic">āyurvedic</span> or allopathic or any. Science is... I mean, advancement of man's evolution of the man's understanding about things.</div>

<div class="After-Verse"> (Hindi) Ghostly haunted. And he talks all nonsense. Similarly, anyone who is in the material condition, he is a ghost-haunted man. So he can talk anything, all nonsense. <span class="Italic">Piśācī pāile yena...</span> This is applicable to everyone. Anyone who has got this material body, he's ghostly-haunted. Therefore we are explaining that verse, that first treatment is how to get out of the clutches of this ghost which has attacked everyone. So ghostly haunted man, he's himself a victim of the ghost. How he can treat other men? He's also haunted by the ghost. This is the position. You may, one may say, "I am haunted by better ghost." That may be, but every one of us ghostly haunted. And <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says this is treatment. <span class="Italic">Tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā, yasmād sattvaṁ śuddhyed [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.

The Darwin's theory, he is putting that the bone is changing. The bone is not changing. You get different bones in different life. I am changing my position. I am going from one apartment to another apartment. The apartment not changing. I am changing apartment. That is the difference between Darwin's theory and our theory. They are thinking the apartment is becoming another apartment. No. The apartments are already there. I am entering different apartments as I can pay for it. That is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> According to my <span class="Italic">karma,</span> I am sometimes residing in one apartment, in another apartment. This is going on.

One gentleman, one big doctor, chemist, he has got Nobel Prize, he came to California and our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara, he was in the also in the university, he's also doctor and chemist. So he was speaking on the chemical evolution. So he's my student, he challenged him, that, "If I give you chemicals, can you prepare life?" "That I cannot say."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But their definition of life is very meager. They say that life is a chemical imbalance, a state of chemical imbalance. That is wrong. Life is something higher than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore these chemists-they are predominating-so how it is possible to take their version? <span class="Italic">Ayi.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...a simple version of Vaiṣṇava.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stay here. We want some Englishmen. (laughter) No. We want Englishmen, Australian, Canadian, because they have no visa problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> American will have no visa problem very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is no question why. We'll understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that's all right. So the visa problem is a great problem for us because in India for conducting our movement, we have to import the white men. Our Indians, they are not joining. So that is a great problem for me. They have to come, and they have to go again. And each time, coming and going, ten thousand rupees. And that is happening at least for hundred cases every year. Ten thousand, hundred times. Just imagine. This is my economic problem. Therefore I'm asking, "If you are Englishman, please stay." Because here, in India, they will see that "The white man dancing, let us see." They will never join. They are busy with their own affairs. They will advise, "Do this, do that," but they will never come. This is my position. Practical. Therefore I'm begging the Englishmen, the Canadians, the Australians, "Please come and stay." Because huge establishment, who will manage? I am managing with them, but there is economic question. For each person I have to spend ten thousand <span class="Italic">rupees</span> at least and such hundred case... This is the position. The Indians are not interested. They are not interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr.Patel:</span> You are firing everyone, so they run away. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done? This is real position.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone may be a fool, but if he continues to remain a fool, that is very bad. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A fool is a fool always. He cannot change his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More or less everyone of us, we are fool, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Kṛṣṇa has stated <span class="Italic">mūḍha, mūḍha.

That is the position. It is our movement. Kṛṣṇa came in India and because India is so glorified place, <span class="Italic">puṇya-bhūmi,</span> even the demigods they desire. Not India, this planet, <span class="Italic">Bhāratavarṣa.</span> Formerly, the whole <span class="Italic">Bhāratavarṣa</span> means whole planet. Anyway, for the time it is now minimized. So it is not ordinary land. So our men, they are not interested in such great movement. How much regrettable it is. And who are they? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ duṣkṛtino narādhamāḥ</span> [Bg. 7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you speak the truth, then you take the quotation of Kṛṣṇa. Now every Indian should take part in this great movement. Every Indian. That is the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is his real suffering. He's part and parcel of God. Qualitatively, he's as good as God, but he's suffering.

That Indians should take very seriously and join this movement, and <span class="Italic">para-upakāra,</span> people need it all over the world. Otherwise, why these young boys, they have joined me? They are finding something, relief by this movement. Otherwise, what business he has got to join with an Indian, poor Indian. I went to their country with forty rupees, that's all. So they are finding something relief. And actually it is relief. So our Indians are not interested. India is supposed to be the, what is called? Benefactor or...?</div>

So, <span class="Italic">sab bhārata-varṣī,</span> young men, <span class="Italic">jitna hai.</span> (Hindi) movement (Hindi) seriously. It is not ordinary movement. Cheating movement <span class="Italic">naiye.</span> This is real movement. Kṛṣṇa, what Kṛṣṇa is speaking, what Caitanya Mahāprabhu is speaking, that is not cheating. That is real solution of the problem. So we have taken the business of Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So every intelligent person, intelligent young man... Now we have got... We have got everywhere, but especially now in Bombay-it is important city-we have constructed this. We can keep at least five hundred, six hundred men in these buildings. But who is coming? Nobody's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If they all come then it will be difficult for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let them come first of all. (laughter) There is no "if." There is sufficient place. Come. But nobody's coming. They want to see, "Let these white men come and we see." That's all. "We see the fun." This is going on. They are coming. They are disgusted. But we are not disgusted. That is the difficulty. Therefore I was speaking to this boy, "You are Englishman, you have come." It's a problem now in Māyāpura, here. And the government is after them as soon as three months pass. "Get out, get out, get out, get out." Then how shall I conduct my business? A big, big establishment. This is another problem. But Kṛṣṇa is doing His own business. But practically seeing. This is India's business. <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.

You see, that charge is rather more grave than the particular one which they have leveled against us. You see, we can put that argument, isn't it? How many Hindus are converted into Christianity. We are not converting them, we are just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our case is not that we are going to convert one Hindu to Christian, or Christian to Hindu. There is no meaning.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That's what I say.</div>

And so long you are entangled with this designation, there is no question of devotional service. Either you Hindu or Muslim or Christian, it doesn't matter. So our business is not that, that we convert a Hindu to a Christian or a Christian to a Hindu. That is not our business. They are thinking, because we dress like that, with <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> with <span class="Italic">māla,</span> they think Hindu. But it's not our business to convert the Christians to become Hindus, as all other missionaries, they are doing. They are trying to increasing the number of Christian or Hindus. So our... There is no question of increasing. It is very difficult to accept.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> During the <span class="Italic">Kumbha-mela</span> we are having our <span class="Italic">rāma-kṣetra</span> to serve the <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> directly. We always started our camp on 21st December to last after tenth of February. If Mahārāja and all other devotees, they can definitely offer free arrangements over there because we have got the best camp. We have got the best camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should we spend for our camp? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We are just on the bed of the river, far away from the <span class="Italic">mela,</span> which is about three, four... We have our <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> at various places, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this philosophy? What is the philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Philosophy is <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> of the Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But whether you recognize Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes sir, he was our guru. We have published a book from the Calcutta University, so just take your remise. Leave the book for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, this is for me? <span class="Italic">Bheṭiye, bheṭiye.(?) </span>Vedānta philosophy (Hindi) Let us discuss. What is Vedānta philosophy? Let us discuss something. You belong to this camp, so what is Vedānta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Ādi Śaṅkarācārya's preaching, actually defining God as what he thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the meaning? Everyone can think of God according to his whim. You say, "As he thought." That is not standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> So, what he describes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all, let us... Whether if you think of God in your own way, is that valid or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Because he has given a thought to it you know. He has thought over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything, might be the first-class thought, but do you think that any man can think of God and create God? Do you think it is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Well we are guided by those who have given a thought to it and who have meditated actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You said that "As he thought."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God is unlimited and you are limited. So how you can think of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You see I'll just quote one of his stanzas which reveal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am talking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I understand your point of view, but I'm just, to your holiness, in the last stanza of his <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy, he says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ nirvikalpo nirākāra rūpa vibhur apya sarvatra sarvendriyāṇi sadame sama...(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says <span class="Italic">"aham"? </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means a person is thinking of God. So that is my point, whether an individual person can think of God and ascertain that "Here is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> He comes to that particular conclusion though, your holiness, he says that <span class="Italic">ahaṁ nirvikalpa nirākāra rūpa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">nirākāra...</span> If you are speaking, then how he can become <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> He actually defines what prevails in the universe, what is that element which governs us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us just discuss from the point. As you say, that I think and I speak, so when you speak, when you think, whether you are <span class="Italic">nirākāra</span> or <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> He defines, ultimately, after all thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am asking you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> He has come to that conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm asking you that when you think, when you... What is that other thing? Speak. So can anybody who is <span class="Italic">nirākāra,</span> he can think and speak? Is there any experience? So what is the use of talking like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Thinking is done by the mind and mind is not soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So, no, whatever it may be. If I think, if I speak, I am <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span> I'm not <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> And that is for everyone. This is contra...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> What is that "everyone"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What it may be. First come to the platform of understanding. As soon as I think, I speak, this speaking, I'm thinking, is not coming from <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But what is that "I"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I means, what do you mean by I? I am person, you are person. When I say, "I say," you say that we are person. So how you can say <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> It must be common knowledge. When I say, "I speak," that is not <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> How it can be <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> It is contradictory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> It is not contradictory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is contradictory. Unless you have got a personality, you cannot speak, you cannot think. So how it is <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> That is my first point. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">"aham."</span> He is person. We worship Kṛṣṇa as person. He says, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> That <span class="Italic">"aham,"</span> He's person. We are accepting Kṛṣṇa as person because he says <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br class="calibre2"/>iti matvā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 10.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He's person. Kṛṣṇa never said that "I am <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span>" Where He has said? Can you quote any verse? When He says <span class="Italic">nirākāra,</span> He says like this, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">. Mayā,</span> by Me. <span class="Italic">Tatam idaṁ sarvam,</span> everywhere, by My energy. Just like the sun-god. The sun-god is within the sun globe. His bodily luster is coming. The sun-god can say, "The sunshine is my bodily exposition." That is reasonable. Just like a big light, it has got exposition. Similarly... And that is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Yasya prabhā prabhavataḥ [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">. Yasya,</span> the person.</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-<br class="calibre2"/>koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam<br class="calibre2"/>tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.40]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> So when Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idam, mayā</span> means, "I am there." But "I" is existing. That "I", person, is existing. Just like if I say that "It is I who has expanded, I am expanded all over the world by this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement," that's a fact. But that does not mean I am not a person. If I say that "I am, this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement means I am, I am spread by spreading this movement," that's a fact. But does it mean that I am imperson? That is, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā. Avyakta.</span> So the same example we can give you that in all my branches, 110 branches, they worship me as their guru. <span class="Italic">Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Everything is existing on My management." <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ.</span> "But I am not there." It is a fact. All these 110 branches, they are going on under my direction, but not that I am present everywhere. But that does not mean I am not a person. So the supreme, the supreme manager, the supreme controller, how he can be <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> That is my first question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He means to say, sir, that the <span class="Italic">māyākāra</span> is not there. But the <span class="Italic">divyākāra</span> is there as we say. Let us understand him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, He... <span class="Italic">Nirākāra</span> is there. So far His management power is going on, that is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> But that <span class="Italic">nirākāra</span> does not mean that I am also <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> That is the defect. The Supreme Person, it is confirmed by the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> The Absolute Truth is person ultimately.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">So those who are simply captivated by the Brahman, <span class="Italic">nirākāra,</span> they are in the, just in the beginning of knowledge. Their knowledge is not perfect. That is not Vedānta<span class="Italic">.</span> That is knowledge, but it is not <span class="Italic">anta.</span> And Vedānta means the ultimate knowledge. And that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one does not know Kṛṣṇa, he's not a Vedāntist. That is my point . He does not know what is Vedānta<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">veda-anta</span> means Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Anta</span> means the last word. The last word is <span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.</span> Bhagavān. Unless one goes to the Supreme Lord Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa, he's not a Vedāntist. That is my point. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Śrī Śaṅkarācārya also said <span class="Italic">bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. One who says... We are studying from our common sense. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge and <span class="Italic">anta</span> means the last. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So unless you know Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of Vedānta<span class="Italic">.</span> There may be <span class="Italic">Veda...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, knowledge. But that is not the ultimate knowledge. The ultimate knowledge will come when you surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore all these so-called Vedāntists, they will have to wait for many millions of years to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is the position. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante.</span> And if he's actually in knowledge, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the sign. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted. So Vedāntist, so-called Vedāntist, we do not approve them because they have not come to the ultimate point of knowledge. This is clear. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge, <span class="Italic">anta, anta</span> means the last point. So unless you come to that last point of knowledge, that is not Vedānta<span class="Italic">.</span> That may be <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> but it is not Vedānta<span class="Italic">. </span>Vedānta means <span class="Italic">māṁ prapadyate.</span> Now, whether you approve these statements? Vedānta means to know Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo vedānta-kṛd veda-vid ca aham.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am the main meaning of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He is the... So He can speak what is Vedānta<span class="Italic">.</span> And unless one accepts this Vedānta, he's not a Vedāntist. Therefore some of our Vaiṣṇava friends, they have given me this title, Bhaktivedanta. In 1947, something, they, purposefully, they gave me the title that Vedānta means <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> "So you take this title, Bhaktivedanta." And we are preaching this Vedānta, that the ultimate platform of <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> knowledge, is to understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">. Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">. Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So he's person, he's speaking. So not that the Māyāvādīs, they take that <span class="Italic">paratattva</span> is the <span class="Italic">nirākāra-brahman.</span> But that is not <span class="Italic">paratattva.</span> Here the person says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you have to accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme authority, then Vedānta means, He says also, to know Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, it is not <span class="Italic">anta,</span> it may be middle, it may be beginning, but not <span class="Italic">anta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, Śaṅkarācārya has made so many abstructs (obstructs?) for this <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> And I mean to follow it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I'm talking of Kṛṣṇa. There are many other talkers. We are concerned because we are Kṛṣṇa conscious. Kṛṣṇa conscious means whatever Kṛṣṇa says, we accept. That is our philosophy. We may be fools and rascals, doesn't matter. But we accept what Kṛṣṇa says, that's all. Like a child, he's a child, he may be a fool. But when the father says, "My dear child, this is called microphone," and if the child says, "This is microphone," that is correct. Because he takes the word of the father who knows things. He may be child. So our business is like that. We don't claim ourself to be very learned, very advanced. We are fools and rascals. [break] "How can I become guru?" One may say. "I am not so learned, I am not so..." "No, no, you haven't got to bother. Still you can become guru." "How?" <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you simply repeat what Kṛṣṇa has said, then you become guru. That's all. So our business is that. We are guru not that because we are very learned, so-called Vedāntist. No. We are lowest of the lowest. But we are faithful to the words of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. We have no other business. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has ordered, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">. Bas.</span> Very easy. And that is being effective. Now because I am carrying these words of Kṛṣṇa throughout the whole world, perhaps I have done the best service than the combined so much Vedāntists. All the Vedāntists of India could not do that. That's a fact. How it has become possible? Because we are simply speaking what Kṛṣṇa has spoken. That's all. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa...</span> That's all. I do not claim that I am Sanskrit scholar, I am this big man, that man, no. Whatever books I have written, only about this-Kṛṣṇa. In our book in every page you will find Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa. My Guru Mahārāja, if we used to write some article, so we wanted to show him how it is written. So he was very busy. So somebody would read and Guru Mahārāja would say, "How many times he has said 'Kṛṣṇa'?" (laughter) If he finds that in every page there is Kṛṣṇa, it is all right. That's all. (laughter) So we are making Vedāntist, "How many times he chants Kṛṣṇa?" If he chants always Kṛṣṇa, yes, he's Vedāntist. That's all. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> Because <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is being effective. These boys, their forefathers or their father, grandfather never knew what is Kṛṣṇa. But <span class="Italic">kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.</span> So unless there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no question of Vedānta<span class="Italic">.</span> That is my point. (Hindi) That is real Vedānta. And the Vedānta says also... If you actually read Vedānta, what is the beginning of Vedānta?<span class="Italic"> Boliye?</span> What is the beginning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not Vedānta. This is <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1]. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is Vedānta. Yes. That is Vedānta.<span class="Italic"> Brahma-sūtra.</span> This is Vedānta. So this life is meant for Vedānta.<span class="Italic"> <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> And what is Brahman? <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ.</span> Brahman means the Supreme Soul of everything. And Kṛṣṇa replies, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then Vedānta study... I'm inquiring what is the ultimate source of everything and here is the answer. If you don't believe, that is another thing. You go on talking like anything. That is another thing. But answer is there. <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">. Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we have to go to such <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> who knows <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti.</span> Then it will be all right. If we want to waste time, that is another thing. I am very glad to see you. So I wish that you may spread real <span class="Italic">Vedānta.</span> That is essence of <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span>Vedānta means the essence of <span class="Italic">Vedas. Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Light is, of course there is light in the sunshine and there is light in the sun-globe, but the source of light is coming from the sun-god. Just like electric bulb, thousand power. So the illumination is also light and the source of illumination, the bulb, that is also light. And what is that? Filament within? That is also light. But what is the <span class="Italic">anta</span> light? Not this illumination. Similarly Kṛṣṇa is the original source of light. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavataḥ [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is confirmed in The <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā.</span> So Brahman knowledge is partial Kṛṣṇa knowledge. Paramātmā knowledge, partial Kṛṣṇa knowledge. And Kṛṣṇa knowledge is perfect. So partial knowledge is also knowledge but Vedānta means full knowledge. So unless you come to that point it is not Vedānta. The another example is just like from a distant place you see one mountain. You'll see just like something cloud. It is not cloud. It is the mountain, but because you are seeing from a distant place you see it is something cloud. If you go little further, you'll see something green, and when you actually go to the mountain you'll find so many trees, so many living entities, so many everything full of varieties. The same mountain, absolute knowledge, <span class="Italic">advaya-jñāna, tattva-jñāna.</span> If we accept <span class="Italic">tattva-jñāna</span> from distant place it is Brahman. If you see that <span class="Italic">tattva-jñāna</span> still nearer, then it is Paramātmā. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna [Bg. 18.61].</span> And when you go directly to the person, just like we are talking face to... That is possibility. And that possibility Kṛṣṇa comes to show us. That is indicated by Śukadeva Gosvāmī that,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">When Kṛṣṇa was playing with His cowherd boys friend, so Śukadeva Gosvāmī said, "Who are these boys who are playing with Kṛṣṇa who is the source of <span class="Italic">brahma-sukha?" Brahma-sukhānubhūtyā.</span> These boys are playing with another boy known as Kṛṣṇa. He is the source of <span class="Italic">brahma-sukhānubhūti.</span> And <span class="Italic">dāsyaṁ gatānāṁ para-daivatena.</span> Those who are devotees, for them He is the Supreme Lord. And <span class="Italic">māyāśritānāṁ nara-dārakeṇa.</span> And those who are under the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> they are seeing He's an ordinary boy. But whatever He may be, these boys who are playing with him, <span class="Italic">sākaṁ vijahruḥ kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ</span> [SB 10.12.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> After many, many lives acquisition of pious activities, now he has got this opportunity to play with this boy, the source of <span class="Italic">brahma-sukha. Itthaṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā.</span> They are not playing with ordinary child. He is the source of <span class="Italic">brahma-sukha.</span> This is the statement of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. So if we come to Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa is personally presenting Himself, that is Vedānta. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām...</span> We have come to that point, but if we neglect, then it will take many, many births to come to that point. Because that is the ultimate. Unless we come to that point, to understand Kṛṣṇa, there is still scarcity of knowledge. And Kṛṣṇa says that "When there is scarcity of knowledge, then I appear." <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the scarcity of knowledge is polluted... Not only scarcity, but it is polluted. <span class="Italic">Glāniḥ. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glāniḥ.</span> This is <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> to come to the perfect knowledge. Human being must come to the perfect knowledge, because this is a boon. Not the cats and dogs can understand. Human being. So when there is <span class="Italic">glāniḥ,</span> they are accepting the preliminary beginning of knowledge as the perfect knowledge, that is <span class="Italic">glāniḥ. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">. Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca... [Bg. </span>4.8]. These things are there. <span class="Italic">Dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya.</span> To establish real religious system. <span class="Italic">Sambhavāmi yuge yuge.</span> What is that real religious system? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is real <span class="Italic">dharma. Bhāgavata-dharma</span> is real, Bhagavān. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> means in a relationship with Bhagavān. So if you do not know Bhagavān then what is this knowledge? That is the defect. All <span class="Italic">dharmas,</span> there may be Christian <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> this <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> that <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Ask any one of them, "Do you know Bhagavān?" "Zero." <span class="Italic">"Nirākāra." Nirākāra</span> means zero. When you come to the right point, zero. No substance. Therefore they have got this prayer, <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi-pāścātya-deśa-tāriṇe.</span> This is going on. <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādi</span> and <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣa. Nirākāravādi.</span> We say... There are so many points. We say that "the Supreme Father," the Christians say. So how the Supreme Father can be <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> We have got experience, my father has <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span> His father has got <span class="Italic">ākāra,</span> his father has got <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span> So if you go to the Supreme Father, now how He is <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> I may not have seen my great grandfather but that does not mean he's <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> So I may not have seen God but if God is Supreme Father how he can be <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, he's a person. His father must be person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is common sense. If son of God, if the son has form, how the father hasn't got form? What do you say? I'm asking you. This English boy. How the father can be formless? Christ says that he's the son of God. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Englishman:</span> He said he was, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But he's a person. So how the father is imperson? What kind of father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, instead of calling person, we say he's an individual. Person means this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Person is individual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Individual. So God is an individual then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, person. God is a person. Individual means person. Individual person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything person is body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body or no body, that is separate thing. But when you say <span class="Italic">individual,</span> he is a person. And it is explained also in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad... Kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 12.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are inclined to the impersonal feature... God has got that impersonal feature. So they have to undergo more troubles to understand Him. And after going through troublesome business, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām,</span> many, many births, then he understands, "Oh, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam,</span> here is the person." Everywhere this disease is very prominent, that God is impersonal. Perhaps this is the only movement in the world that's preaching, "No, God is person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All Vaiṣṇavas believe in the personal God. This is only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bring some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Distribute. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> ...camp. Let your group come and stay in our camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we have already organized. We have also a organized camp. No, no, I would have saved this expenditure by joining your camp, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> There is no question of expenditure. We welcome you and your institution over there. We have an arrangement for about two hundred tents and we have got enough food to offer you, quality food, which you won't find in the whole of the <span class="Italic">Kumbha-mela.</span> Because originally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But suppose if we speak in this way, then you'll not agree. (laughter) Real food is finished. Only <span class="Italic">puris, kacuris...</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> We'll have more real food when you come over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you do not object our preaching like that, then I can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether your swamiji will like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> No, of course. Because actually there is nothing against your preaching. Otherwise, I would not have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is a contradictory. We say God is person, and you say <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> That is the difference. Why God should be <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Ultimately, it is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ultimately, you say <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> We say ultimately <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span> And that is the difference, gulf of difference. That is going on. We shall worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa there. With our <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> just like we are doing in the temple. Perhaps your swamiji will not like this. And as soon as there is some contradiction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> No. Our main theme at the <span class="Italic">Kumbha-mela</span> is to speak direct to <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> who come from Himalayas because mainly since 150 years this institution is serving them at Hardwar and Prayaga. They don't walk down to Ujjain or Nasik. Mainly they come at Hardwar and Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you kindly give us a camp, but we shall preach this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> You are at liberty. There is no ban on it. Actually, you see we, as we said, we are serving the humanity directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That all right. Nice. But sometimes, if somebody differs, that is not very palatable .</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> No, no, Swamiji. There is no... We welcome you there. I told Mangala when she came that we are not preaching a particular thing. We are going there to serve the people who come who are intellectual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For spiritual enlightenment. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes. And practically since many, many years our camp is considered as one of the best from all point of view. Hygienic arrangements, food quality. We don't use <span class="Italic">dalda</span> or anything. We have the pure ghee. There are people who give with heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if you give us one camp, so how many men we can provide there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> At least 50 to 100 people we can accommodate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Or if you want more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Our men will not be fifty to so much. Suppose for us, if you spare one camp, so how many men we can accommodate there. Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> In one tent at least we can accommodate six people. Easily. With a drawing room and two bedrooms. We have the military tents. And just on the bed of the river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how many men you are expecting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Fourteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fourteen. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...you can serve how many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Each tent we'll accommodate with all sanitary conditions. We have in one tent, which is quite a big one, six people easily. With a drawing and two beds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at least three camps we shall require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Three or five. Whatever. Swamiji, number is immaterial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> So why don't you do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One for yourself and three to us. So four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> I can even reserve for your institution six, eight, ten. Number is immaterial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is very good. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Number is immaterial. We have the special boats plying from our camp because what our principle is (indistinct) away from the <span class="Italic">Mela,</span> in seclusion. Now there is a <span class="Italic">bhāga,</span> what is known as a <span class="Italic">munshi-bhāga</span> (?) and since last 200 years all the director <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> they reside there because it is away from...</div>

We are in the bed of the river and this plot is reserved since last 200 years for us from the government when the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> comes. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇa-kumbha, ardha-kumbha.</span> And the boats ply from our spot downstream at Prayaga on the <span class="Italic">saṅgam.</span> That we take them during the day according to the <span class="Italic">nakṣatra.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> If it's away from the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> there won't be so much preaching there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> People will come to you when they know you are there. There is no need to go. (laughter)</div>

What can I say?" This was in 1956 just four years before he passed away. Then he was thinking what to tell these guys. Just thinking for five, ten minutes. And then he spoke for two hours spellbound.
