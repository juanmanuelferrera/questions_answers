<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...to keep it going we took a minimum amount of ten thousand a month. We were getting ten thousand a month. But to finish the building we require more, more per month, because ten thousand is just the most minimum amount just to keep it going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are collecting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, but that is going for maintenance. I give twenty thousand a month now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maintenance, twenty thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, that includes agriculture, the <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> everything. It includes everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Actual maintenance, about eight or ten thousand. Other things, landscaping and other things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Landscaping... We built you a very wonderful park, very nice park. We've also put a walkway around the <span class="Italic">ghāṭa</span> with stairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, what is the position of our big project?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's what I was going to tell you first. So what happened was that the application we had given to the Chief Secretary and the Board of Revenue, that has gone from them to Mr. Choudhuri, who in turn had sent it on to the Commissioner. The Commissioner sent to District Magistrate. The Commissioner sent to the District Magistrate. So District Magistrate, he gave a favorable reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Favorable reply. He said, "This is a good project. It will help the district." He only said that they should maybe get three hundred acres instead of 350 or like that. He reduced something. Then that went back again to the Commissioner, who was a Christian. He's the one I mentioned. He wrote bad report. Then when Choudhuri got it, he wrote a very good report. He wrote a very good report. He said that there's no question of Hindu or Muslim. Just like in Bangkok they have that one big Viṣṇu Temple. Or the Taj Mahal. This is no longer any type of religious. This is for all mankind. Similarly this Māyāpura will be a monument for the whole mankind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> For the whole world. So in this way he gave a very good, very good statement. Then that went to the Chief Secretary again, who had to give it to the Chief Minister. So the Chief Minister he does not have a good opinion. He did not have a good opinion of our society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is the Chief Minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Siddhanta Shankaraya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very expert man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's a very expert... He's one of their chief politicians from India. He used to be Education Minister of Indira Gandhi. He's one of her right hand men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Very important for Bengal. Bengal is the most important state, and he has very prominent position to the Prime Minister as advisor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So at that time, I couldn't write him a letter. He had written that..., something which made Mr. Choudhuri very angry. He wrote something which made Mr. Choudhuri very angry. Made also the Chief Secretary angry. He wrote...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, who wrote?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The Chief Minister wrote. He said, "Because of the impassioned... He said "I would have refused this application except for the impassioned appeal of one of my senior officers, namely Mr. Choudhuri. They are asking for three hundred acres of land but the East India Company, they asked only twenty acres of land and they have conquered the whole of India." (loud <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> "East India Company, they have asked only twenty acres of land but they have conquered the whole of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> "They ruled India for two hundred years."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh. "Ruled India for two hundred years."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said? Chief Minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> The Chief Minister wrote that the East India Company purchased twenty acres of land and rules India for two hundred years. That was his reply to our application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chief Minister said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. They're afraid that by taking this, we will rule India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Anyway, that's a very frivolous statement. That was a frivolous statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that, ruling over India, they politically ruled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But we're not politicians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if we are rule, we shall rule spiritually. We have nothing to do with politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's the point. That's why even the Chief Secretary, he became...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They didn't take it seriously. The Chief Secretary and Mr. Choudhuri did not take that very seriously, that comment. It's a frivolous comment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It's progressed. That's one month ago. Since then it's progressed. Then he said, Let there be more inquiry on the nature of the society and its source of funds, etc..." In the meantime many people had come and inquired about our society. CID, CI.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Also the industrial, one industrial from the... They want to know how we will arrange for so many work for so many people. I met them there. They want to know, "How will you get everyone to work?" They sent... Many, from many different governmental departments, came, inquiring, "How you will do this?" And they all went away satisfied. We showed them the handloom; we showed them the <span class="Italic">gośālā;</span> we showed them the children. Even Tarun Kanti Ghosh, he came, and we lined up fifty children, and they read the <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>, and he almost started crying. He liked it so much. He said, "Oh, you have done so nicely with the children." So they were impressed with the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So that time Mr. Choudhuri, he was put down. But he said, "I have not yet lost hope." He said, but he was put down a bit. That might personally talked to the Minister of Nadia, Anandamoy Visvas, who I personally met last year. And he was telling him that for Nadia he should sponsor this. Even the negative political issue with the Chief Minister, he should push it through. In the meantime I wrote an application to Karun Kanti Ghosh, who up to now we hadn't asked. Because it had already passed all the preliminaries. And I went and spoke to him. I told him that "It has already passed all the government stages. Now simply the Chief Minister has to be convinced." He said, "No, no. You are of good integrity. There is not doubt about ISKCON. I will immediately tell him." He called up the Chief Secretary, the Chief Minister was out then. Later on he talked to Chief Minister. The next time I saw Mr. Choudhuri. Before that, he told me... That's when he told me that "Maybe Prabhupāda should see the Chief Minister." Now he said it's not necessary. He liked your reply to them. After that, I saw Mr. Tarun Kanti Ghosh. Then I saw Choudhuri again a week later. At that time he said, "Now everything is changed." He said "Now the Chief Minister, that problem is solved." He has written that "Let Mr. Choudhuri make the decision. Let him make the decision. But I cannot simply take the decision. They'll say I am biased. I must work in the ordinary ways of the government. But there is no trouble now. You have waited so long. You wait another thirty or sixty days." He said, "Wait another sixty days, and then you'll get it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he wrote? When he wrote this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He spoke to me just two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Then, last week, again I saw him just before Janmāṣṭamī<span class="Italic">.</span> I asked him... And I gave him invitation to Janmāṣṭamī<span class="Italic">.</span> At that time he told me that... There was this bad publicity. He told me, "Now this bad publicity, I think it has given us some benefit."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, could you give <span class="Italic">darśana</span> over here later? They're all been waiting for your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Hey, wait a minute. We're talking about Māyāpura. We're talking about Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there...? Is there there necessity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's no necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. But we had you down on schedule for a lecture. So I said that you're not lecturing, but they just wanted to have a look at you. Later we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomorrow I shall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tomorrow. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomorrow I shall lecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Go ahead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now, just a few days ago, when I invited him for Janmāṣṭamī, then I asked him what the... He told me at that time... He said, "Now..." He had recently received a phone call from the Chief Secretary." You see? Now your favorite project is going to be spoiled." Then he went over to see the Chief Secretary. He showed him an article from the <span class="Italic">Rāja-Sabhā,</span> how the member of Parliament had given this challenge that "Are these people CIA or this or that?" Then Mr. Choudhuri said, "Sir, I am not afraid." He said, "Why not?" "Because I have you, don't I?" Then the Chief said, "Yes. You have won me over. I believe in this project." Then he said that now the Chief Minister has agreed that the project be sanctioned. But he said that "I don't want to take the full brunt of the decision. Let the Nadia District Planning Committee take the decision."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nadia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> District Planning Committee. So the head of the Nadia District Planning Committee is that minister, Anandamoy Visvas. So I went to him and I gave him an invitation for the Janmāṣṭamī. When I saw him, then... You gave me that letter. So I showed him that letter where you have said that "every day we're selling sixty thousand dollars of books, and I think you for helping me." I said, "Sir, we are simply doing Prabhupāda's order. This is not our work. It is not a foreign work. It is his work; we are simply doing it. He is selling so many books that he wants to invest some of the money to develop Mahāprabhu's birthsite. That is all. He has got the money. Why he should not invest it?" He said, "I am going to have a meeting of the committee next week, and I'm going to push your project through. We're going to pass it." That is the last word I heard. So it looks that everything is very good right now... But we have to keep our society very pure because their investigating us very strong. All the time they're having people watching us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There is now in Māyāpura... The talk is, there's... Some special advisors to the Prime Minister are in Māyāpura now investigating to make sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Some of the local people that were working with me, getting petitions, they came and told me that some people from Delhi or outside were inquiring about us, about Bhavānanda Goswami, about Jayapatākā, about this project, about how the devotees are dealing with the public, whether we are doing any anti-Indian work. All sorts of questions they are asking. So it's very important that we keep very up and up right now. All the time. But otherwise the government, they are happy with our work. And so far, Mr. Choudhuri said, other people have indicated that they have found no bad report about our society, although they are looking so hard. Therefore they are passing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> The State government is very favorable. But the doubt, of course, is coming from the central government because they don't know us. But the state government, they are very favorable. Everyone we've met within the State, they like us very much. They like the Society, they like your work, and, of course, they like your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The local police intelligence officer in Krishnagar, when I went to see him, he told me, (Bengali). Like that, he told me. "Definitely I make you an Indian citizen." So they are favorable. I don't know how much they can do, but locally they are favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Now on the weekend we have tours of the building. Many groups of people come. Fifty in a group sometimes come and visit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tourists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, tourists, and we take then on tour of the building. That's Subhaga. He takes them on tour and he gives some preaching. So many people are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Subhaga is in charge of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, he does.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Others are there also. One new boy is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Kiśora.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Kiśora dāsa. He's also translating. He's a little more strong than Subhaga, although new. Very good boy, very humble. He's from a good family also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the flood situation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Very mild monsoon this year. Almost drought. Almost. Very mild. Very little rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rain is not very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. Monsoon is not strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Our aus(?) crop has been hampered because of lack of rain and early monsoon. Only in the past week there's been a little rain. Otherwise, before, there was very little rain. Not fully drought...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But less rain than previous years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Everything is very green and nice, but so far as agriculture is concerned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It requires more rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It requires more rain and early tide. Right now the river is full, but it is not flooding. It is full. See, Mr. Choudhuri, he was interested. At that time when the Chief Minister wrote that, then he wrote this, that "If you were to see the Chief Minister, then this type of letter could be submitted and he would definitely see you, "although it is not necessary to see him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, it's not necessary to personally see him. You might write... When you come to Māyāpura we'll write him invitation that he can come and see and visit you there. That was better. Mr. Choudhuri said that "Your Guru Mahārāja, he has got also the Vaiṣṇava pride not to see the politicians." He said, "This is a good stand. I respect this very much." Actually he mentioned once to Abhirāma confidentially that "If this project comes through, then you'll be requiring some liaison officer because there will be so many government things. At that time I can work for you as your permanent advisor and go to Delhi and here and there and do all the work." I think he wants a job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I thought Mr. Choudhuri would do everything, but that is not the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Almost he is doing everything. Actually he's trying to say that he did everything. But I think that when we saw Tarun Kanti Ghosh that that cleared up that matter with Chief Minister that cleared that up. As far as the other lower secretary men are..., Mr. Choudhuri did everything. The Chief Minister doubt, I think Tarun helped clear that up. That's the only thing that he couldn't change the mind of is the Chief Minister. Otherwise he did everything else, almost, you can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He came on the last <span class="Italic">ekādaśī.</span> Just last <span class="Italic">ekādaśī,</span> what, ten days ago? Seven days he came for the <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> to Māyāpura just to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Tarun Kanti Ghosh. He took <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> he took the <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> and he liked it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I just saw him also just before Janmāṣṭamī, and he was still very favorable then. We talked for about an hour and a half. He introduced me to all the M.L.A's of the twenty-four <span class="Italic">paraganās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tarun Kanti?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When I go preaching, then I go, and the government M.L.A. and Congress people, they also help me. They arrange sometimes places for me to stay and big program. They protect that no people cause us any disturbances. Although we don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about our Godbrothers? They are also opposing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Subhaga made a very... Bhavānanda sent him over to invite Śrīdhara Swami for Janmāṣṭamī, as a show of respect. When he went there... he's not so clever boy. So Śrīdhara Swami asked him, "Oh, what about your land acquisition?" What does he know about land acquisition? We never discussed anything with him. He can only know by hearsay. So then Subhaga said, "Oh, it's in the hands of the Chief Minister," for which I reprimanded at all. Why you have given any information?" But they are very interested in these things, and maybe they are still trying to stop it, but I don't think they have the power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They are the ones who have raised up that first petition, that Surendra dāsa, I think, and others. They are behind that. They themselves were in the market trying to get petition against, but no one would sign for them. We made a little of political..., because in Māyāpura now we have got seventy per cent of the people are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> In our favor strongly. And only a minority are actively opposed, one percent even. And thirty per cent are in doubt. So, so much so that even I saw recently the M.L.A. who was previously against us. And when I saw him I invited him for Janmāṣṭamī, and he said what about our program for a bridge? I said, "Oh, yes, I discussed with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he suggested having a floating bridge to Navadvīpa. That will be very short. Very easily done with least expense." He said, "Anyway, next time you come to Navadvīpa you can discuss with me. I am ready to help you in all ways." So he has turned his mind around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The MLA. The local Member of Legislative Assembly. He was previously a little against us. But because our whole <span class="Italic">aṁśa</span> (?) is for us, if he doesn't cooperate he won't get their vote, they want the development in their area. Also the...He is changing a little. Everyone is saying that our society is actually simply doing sincere work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As they doing (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This food distribution has been very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now the price of rice has gone up by about eighty paisa. From two rupees to two-eighty. So the poor class of people, they are in a very bad situation. So now our attendance has gone up from twelve hundred to two thousand on that Saturday and Sunday, each day. So we have two shifts. So many people are coming that they come from ten o'clock in the morning and wait because otherwise they can't get a boat in time to cross the river. So then we were very surprised to read in a recent newsletter from LA that "They're going to restart the food relief." But we never knew it stopped. We never knew that they had stopped the food relief. We saw then that he said, "They're going to restart." But we never stopped, and we were very surprised to see that. And now they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Rāmeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> To maintain this food relief from the centers only requires what? Fifteen hundred dollars a month. So little amount and so much service is done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So I know Tamāla, he was giving one thousand but he has stopped now. He was giving one thousand a month. And now he has stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Rāmeśvara, you wrote him a letter that "Jayapatākā Swami should be sent money for ISKCON Food Relief." And he told me that "I am sending you. I have four thousand dollars, "which he sent. We had already been 36,000 rupees in debt because we had not received money for six months. But he wrote in a newsletter to the temples that "Prabhupāda has wrote me to send money to Jayapatākā Swami; and now we're going to start again ISKCON Food Relief." But that was making it appear that we had stopped. But actually we had never stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmeśvara? He did not know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Rāmeśvara had stopped collecting from the temples. But we had never stopped...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, he'll collect. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Your program everyone is appreciating. When the newspapermen came out, at that time the black development officer he came there, and when the newspapermen were there he sat down with all the poor people and he took also and said, "This is very good. This is our national service." And they photographed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "National Service"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, he mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Still, though, because of these articles, it has been a little bit hard to secure money from people now because the people who are giving us money, they are under investigation also, the rich people. So when they see we are under investigation, oh, then they get afraid. They don't want to give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because we're under investigation and they're also being investigated, so they don't want to endanger... The government is every day raiding the houses of the rich people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, what is the investigation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They are being investigated for income tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> For income tax. The government is making it so that no one can give any donation. They don't want any more donation. They want everything to come to the government. So it's not easy to get money locally. We are getting enough to do maintenance, but it is not like it was, say, two or three years ago, when you could get 25,000 fifteen thousand, especially in Calcutta, where the income tax, every day they are raiding the houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Even if people give, a life, patron member, 2,222, if they are not so big, they want to give in installment and even though they'll give at one time with postdated... They want different receipt because if they give one lump sum, then it makes it seem that they are very rich. Although they'll give you at one time, they want small, small receipt so that the income tax won't think, "Oh, they are are giving so much donation? They must be very rich. They must have hidden wealth which we can capture from them by investigation." So in this way they are very much pressurized. Sometimes they prefer to give money without receipt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soon the whole, our program is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, yes. No, it's going on more. The book distribution is going on more. More people are joining. There's no hindrance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> These are simply minor obstacles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Pālikā was just wondering if you wanted anything tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If she can... She can make little vegetable, potato, tomato.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Puris?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Or one <span class="Italic">paraṭā.</span> One <span class="Italic">paraṭā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just potatoes and tomato?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, tomato, potato, one vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Prabhupāda's house. Your house. You have not decided where you want to put your house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I wanted that if the major project is done, then we can select. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Let the big land be acquired and pick the best place. Let the whole land be acquired and then pick the best place. You wanted to wait for the whole land to be acquired, and then pick the best place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And not I want, but that you all see, that is the best place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> For the most privacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the time being, that place is very nice, that pond. What is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It's become congested there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We have 138 people now. 138 people are living there. Women, children...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's fifty children now. So that place is now... The front has become somewhat congested...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Congested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...with noise and children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about the painting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Painting is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They've done about sixteen or seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Two men. Ānakadundubhi and what's his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Pāṇḍu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I went to Haridaspur as soon as I received your letter because Bahusvarūpa was there, making arrangement for the Janmāṣṭamī festival. So I spoke to all those people for two days, Thursday and Friday. And the land is in the name of the <span class="Italic">zamindar</span>, Mr..., Ghosh family. There's fourteen members who have to sign. So in Haridaspur nine members are living, and they are all agreed for signing. And they say the other five members live in Calcutta. Once they sign the deed, they'll also sign. There's no doubt because that's not even in their possession. That's in the public's possession. And all the public, Anchal-pradhan and all the other leaders of that village they are also all eager to have us start . I think that we can also raise some money in the neighborhood. There's some relatively rich people. So that... I was trying to register that before I came here but because Monday is... That zamindar has one <span class="Italic">haṭṭa.</span> And that's... His <span class="Italic">haṭṭa</span> day is Monday, so he was busy. And Tuesday was Janmāṣṭamī by government of West Bengal, and Wednesday was our Janmāṣṭamī and Haridaspur Janmāṣṭamī, and I came here today, Thursday, so we couldn't do it beforehand. But as soon as I go back, I can register that. And... But someone should immediately come, Mūrti or Saurabha or someone and see that land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we have to... Yes. We have to see, make plans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because actually just by giving the site plan you can't make a plan because that's a high area and it goes down to the river. So from our land to the river, that is also under our use. That is <span class="Italic">klashjami.(?)</span> That is no man's land, but that we can also use and that has to be some strengthening so that when the river..., and rain cannot wear down the side. So these details they should come and see, and then they could make a proper plan, I think. Without seeing, they can't make. 'Cause it's a very small area, it should be very well planned. And the local people there, they are very innocent people. They don't seem to have any type of enmity or envy at all. They all come and chant and see. Although they don't strictly follow the rules, naturally. They eat fish and other things and smoke, but they seem to be simple people. If someone would work with him, I think he could make the whole village gradually Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But who that person is right now to work, that we have to train up some of our men. Because right now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can do, Svarūpa. He can take training, and he can do. And then, gradually, others will join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I think all the children, they could become <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs. </span>If the parents would be agreeable, they could become <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> and attend morning some class, then go to school. In this way the whole village could be made Kṛṣṇa conscious at least by chanting and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting is the main thing. Chanting and distributing <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> If we get <span class="Italic">prasādam, </span>then... I think that they all contribute some grain. They are very poor agricultural people, but there's no theft there. I asked. There's one man who has three acres. Three <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land he's giving. So they just grow their rice there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can ask that instead of making <span class="Italic">paraṭā,</span> a light <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> in the morning. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Instead of that <span class="Italic">sabji</span> and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">sabji</span> can make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Khicuḍi</span> instead of <span class="Italic">paraṭā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> will be easy, like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want some <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> and the potato?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Put in the <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> and tomato. Like in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. Do you want anything like <span class="Italic">puri</span> or anything to eat with it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> and the vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be easily digested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Digestion is not good now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> This will help digestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> This medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There is ginger, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">ajwain(?).</span> My only concern is about the immigration department. They are gagging you: "Now your visa... Go out, go away, go out..." So they are making so big, big arrangement. If my foreign disciples are forced to go away, then what is the value? That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, as far as myself... Of course, I was supposed to leave yesterday. But there is very easy process. You can come in and out and stay six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that, make plans. That will... Otherwise we are making so big, big, big plan. Who will manage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> For that matter, we can get. Even the American citizen, they can get outside... By various means you can get Canadian and English passports.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But even then, we can go to Lahore, get visa three months, come in, but you can stay six months. Then go out again, get another visa, come in and out. There is no problem. We have already done that with some of the other men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make... Find out such means. Otherwise... Alexander the Great, having so many kingdom, and as soon as he goes away, it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Also, if you wrote a letter to Brahmananda Reddy and that Mr. Mehta, the deputy or whatever, minister, regarding these questions coming in the <span class="Italic">Rāja-sabhā</span> about Māyāpura and Vṛndāvana, "Actually these two centers are my ... I am founder-<span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of these centers, and the people working there are not independent of me. I have asked them to come for assisting me." Then, if a letter like that is written to them and send me one copy, that will help immigration also, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Also another investigation, we're always asked, "Where is your headquarters?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And then "Our headquarters is in India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It must be always stated, "Our headquarters are India." If we say "foreign," that means we are controlled by foreign. We must publish everywhere that our head...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have mentioned headquarters Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We just said offices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They think that Los Angeles is our headquarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is for America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We explain like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But real headquarter here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I think if one letter is given that "We are purely Indian, that I am <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> and they are simply helping me, they are not..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Actual facts is... That would help, if such a letter was given. Then on the basis of that, we cal also go and preach or talk, or we can show that to the local people that "this is..." Because they keep thinking that we are coming on our own. Because you are outside traveling, they see us only, and they think we are independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in every letter heading there is my name, "<span class="Italic">Ācārya,</span> Founder-<span class="Italic">ācārya.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That is their stupidity. But if some, that one direct letter, short letter, then if we have a copy I'll show that to the CID there, that "This, Prabhupāda has written to the Minister of Home. This is in answer to your question."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then take that copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I'll make one draft.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have written already letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You're written already letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To the Home Minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I didn't get. Has he written a letter to the Home Minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Home Minister has given one letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I have that letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Also all over Bengal people are appreciating. I went... When we go preaching in the small towns...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wait, I am coming. Among the... Amongst these... "Not only for India, but the whole world. You are doing nice work." So push this movement. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura wanted Indians, they can... Prabhupāda also. No we have to plan how to... We are not concerned only with India. All over the world. Make plan. Think over. Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda would come to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And when is your program for coming to Māyāpura? All the devotees are offering their obeisances to you. Bhavānanda Goswami, he is following very strictly the <span class="Italic">cāturmāsya</span> this year. He doesn't eat anything before sunrise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> The weather there is very nice because the monsoon is mild. It is very nice, cool weather.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got a bad impression, Bengal during rainy season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not? No, it was not rainy season. This season. Otherwise any season in Bengal, they are very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Insect season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only insect. There are... Insects are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's no insects now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Rainy season no insects. After rainy season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After rainy season. And insect is not so bad. Indigestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Indigestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> What part of India is good during rainy season? Is there any part of India that's good during rainy season?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Vṛndāvana's not too bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think Vṛndāvana. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was there last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I only know Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are now Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are not giving citizenship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Myself? What happened was I applied last September. So now it's nearly one year, so they had sent my application from Māyāpura to Calcutta, Writer's Building. Again back. Again Writer's Building, then to Delhi. Then Delhi sent again back. I went, and I asked the secretary, and I found out that they had sent again back from Delhi, again back to Māyāpura and then re-investigated me. At that time they brought in some local people, and one investigator, he said that "This Jayapatākā Swami, we have heard that he is a very bad person. He beats the people." They said, "No, We never heard such thing." "No, no. We have heard that he is very bad." In this way by negative they are testing. They came and told me that for two hours police is drilling three different people from Navadvīpa and Māyāpura. In this way no one said a bad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you are a famous man, then they'll do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Him and Bhavānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now Bhavānanda is more famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is notorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But now he is in the papers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) He... You are famous; he is notorious. It is very difficult to deal with these nonsense. They are devotees and either notorious or famous. Our Godbrothers, they do not like Bhavānanda. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, they don't like me anymore either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> What is your fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They always thought, because I am not so outspoken, that "Jayapatākā, we can get him to do as we like." But ultimately I don't do anything for them either, so now they don't like me either. Bhavānanda openly was against, and I was passive. I didn't say anything. But when they came to me I also... Actually I am afraid. Mādhava Mahārāja he invited me to attend his program, some festival day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> At his Maṭha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten days? Ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, it was a three-day program. He invited us for one day. But I was afraid to go. He might even poison me. They personally went...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their business, especially Mādhava Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It not materially by poison, then spiritually by ear. One way or other, they have to give poison. So I didn't even want to go. I didn't go, either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrīdhara Mahārāja is also within the group?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Of course, all those details we don't know. By the way, Tīrtha Mahārāja very sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oxygen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He can't breath. He is on a bed with oxygen. Life and death any moment. Injection, oxygen, barely staying alive. One day better, one day worse. Now they say better; then again they say worse. [Break] That is what we simply need, are people... I saw the program so nicely if people would simply come and work sincerely, they'll make spiritual advancement. They'll chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Very quickly they'll become Kṛṣṇa conscious. So now we're seeing that... We're demanding that sincere people come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it may not be the association of lazy people. Free hotel. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Bhavānanda, he's strict on that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He's very strict. Without working, no one can eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not only work. Attending the program. That is essential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They all attend <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati, </span>evening <span class="Italic">ārati</span>. They should also attend morning class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Work is partial. These things are essential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Maṅgala-ārati</span> and morning class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But some of these men are workers. They're not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our cloth necessities are supplied by ourselves? The cloth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The difficulty is right now we have twenty thousand rupees worth of cloth in stock. That is all profit. We only are three thousand rupees in debt. But we have all the cloth. We have no customers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's no customers. We have a huge stock...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You send immediately to America. They will pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> we sent a newsletter to get people to buy cloth the cloth because we have a huge stock of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, you ask Bhagavān. He is very clever. He's expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We are worried that now we're getting good men to join, they're doing good work, then how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think if you prepare according to the order of our foreign centers, then you won't be... They will all give. You can make fine cloth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We can make up to eighty count. Eighty count we can make now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are purchasing cloth, shirt, and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They're saying... Sometimes they say that "The cloth you make is not what we like." But I tell them we can make any cloth. You give us sample. You tell us. We'll make to your specification." They don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even... Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, Jayatīrtha, Bhagavān dāsa, they'll help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The GBC's can write a letter, and I'll sign it, you and Gopāla Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> All right, I'll write a letter. Let's not bother Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that, twenty thousand stock is there? You can send it? In India there is no customer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, because it's made according to European length. Big size.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Up to now we've been making according to the devotee's specification. To make for Indian to make a different type. We can also make Indian sari and other thing. They'll be cheaper one. but previously we were making because we thought that all the foreign branches...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whatever... Now you can make Indian style. You keep great stock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Well, we are hearing that they are buying the cloth elsewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> All right. Come on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? They are buying elsewhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. They are buying sometimes from other. (to JP) All right. Let's go and chant, come back tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Other thing we can discuss tomorrow. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...Birla</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is difficult to go there. It is difficult to go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And here there is more devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here are devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We made this for distributing, and the public, the take and worship in their home, purchase it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> (to Jayapatākā) Let's go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Indian printing? Purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. This is Indian printing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. [Break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, so far the building is concerned, that is already settled up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, that's all set up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> There were some other lighter matters. When I was traveling in my preaching, then last time in Māyāpura, when that Haridaspur, when they offered, you mentioned to me that you liked that we develop these holy spots. So just as a matter of convenience, whenever I was near any holy spot that you mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> I would go and just visit the place. So in my tours, one place I went to was very nice, and that sevaite, he spontaneously, when I showed him all your work, he offered me that he would like to give the temple to you. That temple is much, much more developed than Haridaspur. That's the temple of Maheśa Paṇḍita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And that is the seventeenth branch of Lord Nityānanda. It's got the personal Deities of Nitāi-Gaura that he used to worship. It's got a building worth about fifty thousand rupees on it. A nice, brand new <span class="Italic">nātha-mandira.</span> This man is Shri Keshav Priya Brahmacari. He's a disciple of that Krishna Prem, that Mr. Nixtan or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He talked personally with Bhaktisiddhānta, I heard, in Sanskrit many years ago. He's a disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's Indian or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Well, it's an unusual story that that man was a pilot in the World War, and he was flying over Himalayas or something, and he saw Kṛṣṇa in his mind's eye or something, and then, then he was shot down, he saw Kṛṣṇa, and then, when he landed, he searched out who he saw, and he came to Vṛndāvana or something and saw the Deity of Kṛṣṇa, and he became initiated at Rādhā-Rāmaṇa temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhā-Rāmaṇa</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This is that guru story. Now he only made a few disciples, and he always was chanting. Also Panditji, he knew more. I don't know so much about his guru but I've heard a little bit that his foreigner became a guru or became a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nixon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> His previous name is Nixton, he initiated name was Krishna Prem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. He was in Almora.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Almora, yes. I don't know exactly where Almora is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Almora is a hilly station, Himalaya. If... Almora, one goes from Lucknow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So this <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is a disciple of him. Therefore he doesn't have any connection. There's no <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> anymore because his guru's disappeared, and somehow he's got this <span class="Italic">sevā</span>. These are the Deities there of Nitāi-Gaura. There's about twelve <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-śilās</span> also. And a little Rādhā-Gopīnātha. This is all mentioned in your purport. It's only about four or five hundred yards. I could read from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It's four or five hundred yards from the Palpara Railway Station. It's the next station from Chuktaha, under Chuktaha police station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chuktaha? Chugda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Chugda: That's where you take your... That mango orchard where you take your lunch? That's just the nearest place go Chugda. So he was very pleased with all the work that you are doing. He's in Vṛndāvana now for Janmāṣṭamī. He hadn't been to Vṛndāvana for about five years, so he went to Vṛndāvana for <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> He may be there even when you go. I'm not sure if he'll be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have advised to see our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, he'll definitely visit. I also gave him an introduction that if he goes, he should be received there. He's got... The present place where the Deities are situated is on four <span class="Italic">cuttas(?)</span> of land. And apart from that, where Maheśa Paṇḍita's <span class="Italic">samādhi</span> is, he's got three <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land. That's right next door to a four-hundred-year-old temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chugda is to the... It is from Shrirampuri? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, it's on this side of the Ganges. It's on the eastern side of the Ganges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, eastern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> There there's another temple of Jagadīśa Paṇḍita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That is run by Mādhava Mahārāja. That's in actual Chugda, and this is another mile or two miles from Chugda. That Jagadīśa Paṇḍita Mandira has got big Jagannātha Deity and one stick which Jagadīśa Paṇḍita carried the Jagannātha Deity from Jagannātha Purī with. I saw both temples. They told me there that "You should see this temple, very lovable Deities." I went in. Actually the Deities are very beautiful and very well kept. Just like in Mādhava Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">mandira</span>, underneath the<span class="Italic"> siṁhāsana </span>they didn't wash. Only in front. But this man, everything was neat and clean. It looked like a thriving, more or less, a thriving place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So difficulty is that if we take charge, we may give it for worshiping to one disciple, but the immigration department will gag him. That is the difficulty. And we don't have many Indian disciples. Otherwise we can take all these important places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Also, last time I was in Calcutta and I saw Tarun Kanti Ghosh, then he mentioned to me again that the people from Panihati, this time that they had reached a decision that they wanted to give us the <span class="Italic">sevā </span>of Rāghava Paṇḍita's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we take. Let us take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's a very important... But that's in dilapidated state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall repair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> In the letter of the Home Minister where he said that every disciple can stay for two years, possibly if he allowed that in every center, if a minimum of a few people could stay for citizenship that might...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Ordinary, by rotation and three, two or three or four permanent, by citizen, if he allowed to stay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Then that would solve the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Not too many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not too many. Say at least five. They will manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Four or five. All others on rotation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They they will manage, and if they allow two years, that's all right. One devotee comes, another goes, another... That will be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because some that are acclimatized, it is difficult for training up. A few people are better to stay there that are trained up on that basis. I think with Mr. Putnaik and others that... Because he also wants that Orissan development... They can understand that it is important to have one or two people that are known people stay there. If every two years a change is, that is disadvantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our Gaura-Govinda I think he is doing there nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's doing nice in Bhuvanesvar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He has already few cottages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Of course, I didn't see myself. I heard he has got a few cottages, three, four cottages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our Gargamuni has seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, I think Gargamuni has seen. Gargamuni is giving him some help. He printed one Orissan book, and he gives him sometimes some books and help. He is fixed up, that Gaura-Govinda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's fixed up. That's nice. Let him translate in Orissa and, if possible, in Hindi. And give him few devotees. Then he'll be encouraged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I think he has got two or three devotees now. This man himself is a pretty capable worker. He's somewhat like Prabhu Swarupa, only a little older, little more mature. He's about forty-five or so. He's been able to collect about, what I can see, about fifty thousand rupees for one <span class="Italic">nātha-mandira.</span> And he has a couple thousand people. I heard from the Gauḍīya Maṭha. They say they have big <span class="Italic">utsavas</span> there. Every year two three thousand people come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So he's a capable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manager.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span>...manager in his own right. He wanted to meet you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us cooperate with him. You take it. And he is there. In the meantime, our men may be trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's invited us to come. He has some festival coming. Then we can just go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> ...and keep a good relationship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The main one is in December.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our difficulty is this immigration. If we can manage this, then all such places we can take. There is no question. The only thing is that government is gagging. One has to go and it means ten thousand rupees unnecessarily. If that ten thousand rupees was invested in developing that center, much improvement could be done. But they are gagging. They are dreaming, "CIA."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When I go back, I'll see this Rāghava Paṇḍita because there the MLA, he himself wants it because that's a very important place and it's going bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that MLA can help us to get some citizenship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> With MLA and Tarun Kanti Ghosh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span>...we can use them for pushing because they are personally interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> they'll be able to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can bring so many men and keep everyone in charge of such places, and it will develop. Money, there is no scarcity. But the difficulty is as soon as we establish, the immigration, "You go away." This is... What is this? You say the MLA and this Tarun Kanti." This is our difficulty. Otherwise there is no difficulty. We can take all the charge and develop them very nicely." So if one man is kept in charge, and after few months he's advised, "Go away," then all his training goes to hell and we have to spend another ten thousand rupees<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the difficulty. What... We are not... Not a single case there is that we have taken any part in politics. So give us some facility. We can take charge of everything. Tell them that actually that is fact, that there is no scarcity of money. We can bring money from America and develop. There is no difficulty at all. The difficulty is the immigration department. You can say that "Prabhupāda has put this philosophy, <span class="Italic">andha...</span>" What is that? <span class="Italic">Paṅgu. Andha-paṅgu-nyāya.</span> Blind and... Depends on this... Blind and... I think you have already know. Blind man, lame man. One man is blind, another man is lame. Both of them are useless. But when they combine, the blind man takes the lame man on his shoulder, and the lame man gives direction to the blind man, "Go this way. Go this way." So he walks. So both of them are benefited. So America has got money but blind. And India has got culture but lame. So let us combine. Then things will be done very nice. <span class="Italic">Andha-paṅgu-nyāya.</span> Just like I am the same man. I was finding difficulty to start this mission in India, very, very difficult. With great hardship I published three books. But as soon as I went America, the <span class="Italic">andha-paṅgu-nyāya</span> became successful. So this is the the position. So instead of becoming envious from political... We have nothing to do with... To the Americans unnecessarily thinking that "CIA, CIA..." Let American money and India's culture combine together, and the whole world will be benefited. America has got enough money; they can spend. Either they give me as the price of my book or anything, money is there like anything. India has got culture. So Indian culture, Vedic culture, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> culture, pushed through American money, the whole world will be benefited. Convince them. It is not the question of India, America, here... It is a cultural movement for the benefit of the whole world. <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma.</span> It is cultural movement. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement is aiming <span class="Italic">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi. </span>So Tarun Babu, you are such a devotee of Caitanya. Caitanya Mahāprabhu wants it. <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte āche yata...</span> Why don't you help us? Your family is devotee of Lord Caitanya, and this is spreading Caitanya's mission. You should give up everything and join this movement, if you are actually a devotee of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And Prabhupāda says that he knows at your heart you want that Caitanya's movement is spread all over the world, so far he has studied you. So let us join together. Why we should unnecessarily be biased, American and Indian and this way and that way. Let us join together and spread Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement all over the... They'll be happy. Everyone they'll be happy. Will be happy. It is such a nice... India will be glorified. America will be glorified." If we... You came here. You have got so much strength. If you work continually, the whole world will be... So those who are offering, take. Take those places. Let us begin. If anyone wants some property, we should take immediately. You said there is already building costing fifty thousand? So that's a property. So if they are offering, you take it and develop. These are historical places. Haridaspur is also historical, I think. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vena? Venapur is nearby. Two miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Two or three miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it, the same facility, two or three miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, that's been, Haridaspur, since time of Lord Caitanya, for many, many years, four hundred... Right from the time of Lord Caitanya they are calling that. They say there's no doubt that Haridāsa Ṭhākura came that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That must be. It is 2-two-three miles. If he was a person belonging to Venapur, so two-three miles surrounding he must have gone. There is no doubt. And if you can establish good relationship with Pakistan, Bangladesh, then our whole question is solved. Go there, seek some preaching and come here, and all these motor care problems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I don't want to sell them, you know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is a very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because we took great hardship to bring them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Why we should sell them? They are so useful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They have done so much work already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is... Nowadays motor vehicle driving is an important item for anyone. We have spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness so quickly on account of the modern transport facilities, so we must take it as favorable. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">. Anukūla,</span> favorable. Favorable, favorable. It is not we have got concern with material. That is not Rūpa Gosvāmī's... <span class="Italic">prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi...</span> This cars can be used for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness; why it should be condemned? That is not intelligence. Rūpa Gosvāmī condemns it. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> Things which is in the service of the Lord, if we think it is material, then that is not <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span>. That is not renouncement. That is foolishness. [Break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When I was traveling in Burdwan, there we saw the big palace of Maharaja of Burdwan</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Gigantic. He has given that to the university. Then we did a <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> at his... He has one temple of Rādhā-kānta. That's present <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> is about a twenty-two-year old boy. He's in the <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> of Nimbārka Svāmī. So he doesn't know anything about, very much about spiritual life, although he is following the tradition. That's such a vast... That building is vast. I can't explain to you how big that is. It's at least five times bigger than our building in all ways, and... It is a huge compound. He has got much land in the name of the Deity. So he's becoming a member because he wants to read your books to understand about Lord Caitanya and spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now for making member you should be very clear so that no misunderstanding takes place. Books, we shall give five books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> On my form I have already printed we give five books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "When you finish, you return this; you take another. When you finish that..." In this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> What we've been doing with members in Calcutta, members who want more of the books, they sign the standing order and they pay us for the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Every month. One book a month and they pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And they sign the standing order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So we have taken many personal standing orders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We have one boy Santoṣa. He goes door to door, meeting Bengali men, and they are signing standing orders and taking <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> He has already done four standing orders in about ten days' time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bengalis? Bengalis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, only to Bengalis. Because it's in their language...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They can read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is in English. Anyone can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, but Bengalis, they can appreciate more Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I tell the members that "You can't get any <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams,</span>" because there's too many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why not? If he reads, give him. And it is very easy. Suppose I give you five books. You become member. So you read it and take another five books. This five books I can give to another. In this way we can manage. There is no misunderstanding. We give you book for reading, not for selling. Not that I have money. Now so many books, let me sell it and get return as many, as much money as possible." <span class="Italic">Bāniyā</span> tendency is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because they're paying 2,222 rupees. If they only give them five books on exchange, I don't think now they'll be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What for he's taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They're satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now we're giving them the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We told them "You can't have any books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the cause of dissatisfaction? You take the books for reading, so you finish this and again we give five books. We take back this and give you in exchange. So actually we give them five books for good. That we are prepared. Five books at fifty rupees each, that one or 250.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But they're giving two thousand rupees<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That's for membership. That isn't just for books. Sometimes they stay in our <span class="Italic">mandira.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We pay for their <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And three days, free boarding and lodging. In this way things should be clear so that in future they may not complain, "Ah, we...," as they are doing. Somebody is coming: "Oh we have given 1100 rupees to live forever." Some ladies came like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, I know, I met that lady.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they take it, advantage. "Oh, we shall get all books and live forever. There is no charge. Pay. "That misunderstanding should be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So now we say they can live forever but as we live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. That... That you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Not that they will get special privilege of..., as hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they want free hotel. That is... They want free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Sometimes old man who has got some money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, old, old man is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He wants to live, and he is too weak to do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He wants to chant and give some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him purchase one room. Let him live... For life he can live, and we give him <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Purchase one room. Eight, ten thousand rupees<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, fifty thousand, I think. In Vṛndāvana we are selling sixty thousand. Sixty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, but those rooms have attached baths. In our room there is no attached bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say in Vṛndāvana, that... Or anywhere. Whatever money is fixed up, let him pay, live in his room comfortably and we give him free <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> There is no harm. But he must attend the <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and rules and regulations. There is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No tea, nor... All the rules he should follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Attend the program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if old men cannot follow, still, he should be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> What about tea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tea. Tea can... Then he'll caught. That is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because the old man they are addicted to the tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what... Many old men, they can give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We will promise them cow's milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Pure cow's milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "instead of this tea, you take milk." Little milk, that is beneficial. So membership should be clearly defined so that they may not misunderstand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But we're not having trouble now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because we printed a new form. And generally when members come they always donate more so we give them one book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They always... I visited one hundred members, and all of these old members, they gave one thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Yes, they will give. I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They'll give if you treat them nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And I gave them one book, and they're satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any person who has money, we'll receive. So many places they are offering us land...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There's another man who wants to give a big property. When you come to Calcutta he wants to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, it's in Rajastan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It's a place which he's not using. He met you in Bombay. He also visited our centers in Paris and New York. He's a Marwari man, very rich, very nice. He's also donated good sums to the society. So now he wants to meet you, and he wants someone to go there. So I told him we will go and look at it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It's in Rajastan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rajastan? Where? Which side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It's near Beekanair. It's with agricultural land and a big house. They said they spent about fifteen lacks on it, marble house. The family is not using it. They have no use. We're getting a lot of offers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But because of Māyāpura, I have not taken them very seriously, because we already have huge affair in Māyāpura. But if you like, we can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">kāca dhun kāca kaphe (?):</span> "If some property is offered, we should take it." That is the... And washed cloth. <span class="Italic">Kācā dhun kācā kapha</span> (?). If somebody offers you very nicely washed cloth, you should use it. And some property, you must use it. They are... You can utilize this property by inhabiting the persons, if they are inclined to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are rotting outside Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They may come to live. We are for everyone. So he... Where does he reside, this gentleman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> In Calcutta. His businesses are there. He's a wealthy man, very nice man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where does he live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He's lives in Bara Bazaar. His name is Mr. Buwalka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bara Bazara Marwaris are all businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This combination of rich men, poor men, for Kṛṣṇa. The same-<span class="Italic">andha-paṅgu-nyāya.</span> Both of them are useless separately, and when they combine in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are all useful. It is very good example. And there is another example, that a piece of wire is falling, rotting, and a piece of bamboo, rotting, and a piece of squash skin is rotting. And one gentleman collected. He nicely trimmed the piece and dried the squash, the outer portion, and took the bamboo and nicely cut it and joined the string and this became a sitar: "Ting, ting, ting." So it is the intelligent person who joins all these things and makes it very useful. These are the examples. The bamboo alone is useless, and a small piece of wire, useless, and a thrown out squash skin, useless. But if you can join them together,...you can "Ting, ting. Similarly <span class="Italic">andha-paṅgu-nyāya.</span> Here is a lame man; here is a blind man. All right, combine together and use them. That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhi labhate.</span> This wire does not change. It is wire. But when it is combined, it is useful. So our propaganda is, "They are separately planning useless. Let them combine together in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All this planning shall be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We were all useless in the West, but you have come and then engaged us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Kṛṣṇa's desire. Nobody is useless. I was also useless. I could not do in India alone anything. This is... Again this example (laughs). Two useless makes useful. Intelligence alone cannot work. Money is required. One man was challenged, "You have no intelligence." So he said, "Yes." He was searching these..."No, why you are searching here?" "No, here is intelligence. If here is money, then my intelligence can work. Otherwise what is the use of intelligence?" But he was searching here," Whether I have got intelligence?" Simply intelligence... In industry also: land labor capital, organization, four things. Simple capital will not do. Simple organization will not do. A man may have very good brain power, organization, but if he has no money-useless. So four things required: land, labor, capital, organization. That minister in Raṅganātha (?), he is inclined to spend huge income of Tirupati, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But he is bound up by other colleagues. They are applying the money. So he's willing to call all the ministers if I can convince them. I shall try it. Just... In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that is, <span class="Italic">yajñārthe karma.</span> Everyone is <span class="Italic">karmī.</span> So the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> the village cultivators or big men industrialists, they are going to Tirupati. Whatever then can spare, they are offering. That is <span class="Italic">yajñārthe.</span> If this money is taken and again if it is brought into <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> then it is misleading. <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> are giving them. Just like people are giving us money. They are <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> But because they are giving us and we are engaging the money in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so the money is fully utilized. But if this money again taken and again to the <span class="Italic">karmīs...</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Without any spiritual work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is a farce. His purpose is served, but one who is misleading the..., he becomes criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The man who gives, his purpose is served.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His purpose is served.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The man who takes the money is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is to be punished. His misusing. Suppose in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement somebody gives us money. He is giving good faith that "It is very good organization." But if I misspend that money, then I am responsible. Then I'll be punished. His business is finished. Kṛṣṇa noted that he has given his hard-earned money for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If I take that money... Instead of doing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if I use it for my sense gratification, then I'll be... Then I'll be responsible. What is the use of Kṛṣṇa's money being used in industry? Any purpose outside Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Let this money be utilized for spreading the glories of Kṛṣṇa. But they do not recognize Kṛṣṇa. All the so-called <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> readers, they want to kill Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, that's a fact. The Calcutta plan that you had, it is still under consideration. At first the Calcutta corporation refused, but then Abhirāma saw the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Mr. Subata Mukerji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I gave the meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He said, "No, I want this." But there's still a problem, is that they'll allow a monument, but they don't want the Deity. They'll allow us to build a monument for Bhaktivedanta Swami but no Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, then take this proposal: "All right, no Deity." We shall hold meetings, lecture. What is that? In the park people come. And we decorate the whole hall with pictures. Gradually we worship one picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Later on, maybe we can put Deity. Once it's built, they cannot tell us to get out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's what Mr. Choudhuri said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He said, "You can take and once a week you bring Deity and put, and other time you just do <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> One week, it stays one week. Then it stays one month...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We can take the Deity for a walk around the park, and then into the hall for two hours...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For some time, two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And then take out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then do that. And we are inviting everyone. We have no distinction. Anyone can come to the park. Convince them. (continued on another tape) "Come on! Take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> "sumptuously." They'll be satisfied. They are hungry. Actually they are hungry, poorly paid, capitalist and worker. The trouble is, capitalists, they are taking all the profit, and they are enjoying life in wine and women. Naturally the worker will see that "Why? We are working so hard, and they are making profit, and they are enjoying, and we do not live in a very nice house. It is a slum." Naturally they will be envious. If the capitalists spend the money for Kṛṣṇa consciousness-in each and every factory they hold festivals and give them eatables like anything everything will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We tell them that "If you give your Kṛṣṇa tax, this will save you from the income tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because they are raiding...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> "...because you are hoarding. But if you give..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The industrialists... That is also one of our programs. Let them hold festivals every Sunday, as we hold. And we shall go and have <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and sumptuous feeding give. They'll be very satisfied. And instead of giving the income tax, let them spend in this way. Convince them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> At the factories. Weekly foodstuffs. They feed all the workers. We'll prepare the prasāda, offer to the Deity and feed to all the workers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Presently the building they're in now is unbearable, as far as living</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, it is old building. Water supply is very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It is a rotten building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rotten cannot be repaired?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. And the landlord won't allow him here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because he wants to get us out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But he won't allow any repair. You have to have his permission to get repair. If you don't get landlord's permission, then you cannot repair. You're forced to live in a slum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you require permission of the landlord if he pays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, no. Even if he doesn't. Any construction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't think that is the law. That is the law? I am feeling inconvenience; I cannot repair?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, how that can be? You can tell the police.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, then you have to go to the court, and that takes ten years. Just like he's in the court for five years now. He is not taking our rent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let us repair. Let him go to the court. Because by repairing, we have broken the law, so let him go to the court. The same logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Actually, Abhirāma... Also the facility for living there is only good for five or six persons. Otherwise it is not good. So they want to get a building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what happened to the corner house? What happened to the corner house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, that is still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you purchase it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Which corner one? The one right across?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Left corner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, but that's even worse condition than what we have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, we break it and prepare nice temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He went to see that man. That man doesn't want to sell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He's one of these Marwaris who is very miser. He himself lives in a slum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But right now Abhirāma hasn't found another place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I just talked to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He told me ten minutes ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So they are thinking they want to get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And one thing is that next thing will be... Now there are many flats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Now, we have one flat that we are renting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not renting. Purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, the only thing is with these flats in Calcutta, they are so mismanaged, these new places. They become a slum in two months. In Bombay the flats are managed nicely, but in Calcutta when they build a new one, within two months the whole thing is filthy dirty. The elevators don't work. It's not worth purchasing a flat. I have one now. I am renting. It's on the twelfth floor, and the members of our traveling party stay there. There is nice water and so many things. But the building is so mismanaged. Who wants to stay there more than a year? We need our own place. Then we can keep it clean and nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that own place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, there are buildings that we can get. In Balijunj we have some offers. That's if this park doesn't come through. If the park does not come through, then we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all all try to make... This is the best place in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I personally went with Abhirāma to see the minister, and the minister didn't give any stipulation. He was only for the project. His only reservation was that, he said first of all, politically, he doesn't know about our society. If the government home department says that it's all right... As far as the program is, the plan that was given, he totally accepts it as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That's when I saw him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Since then, Abhirāma has not seen him. But the people in the corporation, they have refused it without his sanction and they have written him that the minister said he does not want it. When we took that. We showed it to the minister. He said, "This is completely wrong." He said, "No, no, no! There is some misunderstanding." Then he said, "You write me a letter that there is some misunderstanding, and I will take care of this matter."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So he wrote the letter and now they forward that letter back to the Calcutta corporation without a letter from the minister. Because he went back there. He just told me that. So it's back again to the same guys who, you know... Of course, I don't know what letter he has written, but the officers would not tell us anything. Anyway, we will try our best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not take the Victoria Memorial? What is, they are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I have never gone inside. I heard it is simply old English armor and some swords.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And the marble is turning black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They don't clean it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> How they can afford to maintain such a building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa will maintain. We can utilize it properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And we'll have British <span class="Italic">pūjārīs.</span> For the glory of Queen Victoria.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Victoria. Let them send. Tell them that we shall bring. Victoria has... Let them send to worship Victoria with <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That is real Victoria Memorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That is <span class="Italic">putra. (kīrtana</span> in the background throughout this conv.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, great grandson. <span class="Italic">Putra</span> is great... The <span class="Italic">putra</span> was that Edward Seventh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, but to lift from hell. When she gets <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. <span class="Italic">Pun-nārakāt trāyate iti putra.(?)</span> Victoria died in 1903. There was great function, and this building started in 1903, and it was finished in 1922.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> After her death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Lord Kurgeon's plan... Lord Kurgeon wanted that let there be asking of India from the family of Victoria. He gave this plan. But this Parliament did not want that Englishman shall make India home. Then his interest will be in India. Just like America. Englishmen, as they made America their home, they declared independence. Australia. As soon as you make a home, then the more interest will be in India. Washington was Englishman. Was he not? Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. Well, everyone came from England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not from England. But ordinary... So Englishman, why he declared war against the English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Their interest was in America more than England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Naturally. So as soon as you make home, your interest will be at home. So that was their policy. In those days no Englishman was allowed to purchase property in India. All his income, money, should go to England. So the Mohammedan Moguls, they made their home in India. Therefore they stayed for eight hundred years. They would not have gone. Indians did not like to finish the Mohammedan kingdom. No, never. It is the Englishmen. They penetrated and finished them, not the Indians. Indians were not against the Mohammedans. They are going on. Little bit discrepancies were there, especially during the time of Auranzeb. He was bigot Mohammedan. He hated the Hindus. Not hated, but he was a, was is called, bigot, Mohammedan? He did not hate. That was not his qualification. Auranzeb gave many contributions to the Vṛndāvana temples. Yes. And Auranzeb's grandfather, Jahangir, he gave so many temples to many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> There is one village just opposite Vṛndāvana, Keśīghāṭa, Jahangipura. This village was given to a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> From the income he was maintaining a temple. And Auranzeb... You know Sringarpat Goswami?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, Shankar Kumar has brought the food and all these things to his place. So if you like you to afterwards or take here or what would you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, let them take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Pradyumna thought that you wanted to take with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I can take, but you'll take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> They have their food and you will also have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is that? Let them take here in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> In the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because I will have to take at least one hour, how they will wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Better they take separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Indians did not like that Mohammedans may go away. Rather, when Shri Raj Birla (?) was arrested by flight, the Bengali <span class="Italic">zamindars,</span> they protested. Rani Bhavani, she protested. Although it is alleged that Shri Raj Birla (?) kidnapped her daughter. But if Shri Raj Birla kidnapped her daughter, how he (she) supported Shri Raj Birla? There are so many falsehoods. On the whole, the Indians never planned to drive away the Mohammedans. They never. That's a fact. They were happy because there was no exploitation. All these Mohammedans, they made their home in India, so whatever lavishly they were spending, that was coming to the Indians. In Taliganj (?) there is a man. Now they are aristocratic family. He was servant of the <span class="Italic">nawab</span>, and he stolen one shoes, one feet, which was bedecked with jewels. So by selling that jewel he became a rich man. So although they were using jewelled shoe, but it was in India. They were satisfied that "I am <span class="Italic">nawab.</span> I am using jeweled shoes." But the jewelled shoes was in India and these Englishmen, they have taken away all the jewels even from the walls and keeping them in their homes, all gold, jewels, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yeah. That's a fact that in those old houses, the Marwaris they have inherited of all these pieces. Now they have it all. In the old British houses many Marwaris have taken over, and they have inherited all of the treasures of the British.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Many antiques.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyway, if I take away something from you in this room and I keep it somewhere in this room, then where is the difference either with you or with me? That was going on during Mohammedans' ruling. But these people, they took away from the room. So India became poverty-stricken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> One more thing. Locally that bank that opened there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are... They are crazy fellows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That bank is worthless. They don't know anything about banking. They are farmers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forget it. If bank like Central bank or United, that bank... They are useless, and they are asking ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees deposit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Five <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> They will give interest. They'd like a fixed amount...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who believes them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, but I don't trust that bank because they already tried... They kept fifty thousand rupees<span class="Italic">.</span> It took us two weeks to get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They didn't have any signature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It doesn't matter, though. It's still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not... It is a small cultivator's cooperative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I wouldn't trust a small bank. At any time they can lose. They only have three or four branches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They're backed by the Reserve Bank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> What do you mean, it doesn't matter? What big bank?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who is going to deposit five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees with them? That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, that's all right, but as far as the bank goes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We can go on without the business. We cannot deposit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Any banker goes there, they'll want a deposit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why should we deposit five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees? The money value is decreasing daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We get credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you deposit five lakhs now, it will decrease value in five, ten months. The purchasing power of money is decreasing. Now what you can purchase with five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees, after five years you'll require ten <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> So your money will decrease. And if you invest that money in land, after five years it will increase to its full extent (?). So why should we waste our money? What is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> The farmers don't keep their money in the banks. The government is trying to force the farmers to keep their money in the bank. The farmers don't want to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Farmers' policy is if they have got money, they purchase land. Therefore they are making ceiling. The whole policy is not so good (?). Farmers, as soon as they get some money, they want to invest the land but the ceiling..., so they cannot invest money in the land; they give to the bank. And as soon as you keep money in the bank it will decrease the value. This is... Money is decreased, value of all over the world. Because it is not money actually; it is paper, cheating. Real money is gold. But they will now allow to keep the gold. The whole policy is vicious. If I purchase gold with five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees, then it is real money, and after five years I can sell it ten <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> That they will not allow. Therefore I... My policy is that whatever money is there, spend. Don't keep. In land and produce food. That is the best use of. All buildings, government (for men?), there is no need of. And instead of keeping money and take interest, you print books. That is also good. You can sell. Or you purchase land for producing food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> If we stock money, then there'll be no preaching. But if we print books, then we have to sell the books. So that is preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I am insisting all over, "Print any book." Never mind either Hindi or English or... Print book and keep it in stock, nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And gradually we will sell. Then we will preach. Otherwise, if we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the purpose of my Bhaktivedanta Trust. Fifty percent must be spent for printing and fifty percent for building. That's all. No money. Don't keep any account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Then the government will never get envious because there's nothing there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we haven't got to keep so many accountant, auditors, and other nonsense, unnecessary things. As soon as there is collection, invest the money in some building or in making some book, book printing. Follow this policy. I am very much eager. I have got money here and there, but I want to spend it in this way. So therefore I am advising take this. We shall invest renovating them and in developing them. Spend money. Don't keep money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. So I'll tell them our policy is changed. We don't keep any more money in fixed deposit because it's a losing bargain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Actually it is losing. Actually it is losing. Every day the price... Just like the price of rice has increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It is up and down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up and down, now... Take it. When it goes up it does not come down, generally. So this is practical example. Two months ago you were purchasing two rupees-now two-eighty. So where is the value of the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> If we invest in books... Just like this little pamphlet I printed. It cost me fifty paisa. If we sell it in one month...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Then we will get fifty paisa profit. We will double our investment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was nicely... That was nicely printed. So in this way invest our books or land. We don't want to keep cash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And if they want to keep branch or not, that is up to them. We can't give them any money. If they want to keep branch or not, that's up to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be up to them. If they keep branch we can take that. They'll go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We will tell them frankly that for us to invest in books is more profitable because after one month we get more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We cannot keep money and without any... They will give interest. What is that interest? And he said we have printed fifty paisa and selling hundred paisa. So that much interest they cannot give. They'll give, utmost, ten percent. Ten percent per annum-not even one percent in a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Your books will be our bank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have got business. Why shall I keep in the bank? This is the policy. If your money is idle, we can spend it in our books, in our purchasing land in temple, constructing temple, developing... So where you got that water? Water's there? Don't touch that water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, there's one bucket of mixed with half a bucket of hot water. Yesterday what happened, the tank, some blockage... (End)</div>
