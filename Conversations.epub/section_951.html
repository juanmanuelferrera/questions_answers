<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of this human being, people do not know how they are kept in ignorance. And because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, out of His causeless mercy He comes to deliver us from this ignorance. Unfortunately, they are so much engrossed by the illusory energy, they do not take advantage of the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. So therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being propagated that these dull-headed <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span>-they are being described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> dull-headed; they do not know actual interest of life. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> These dull-headed conditioned souls, they do not know their real self-interest, being influenced by <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> is also Kṛṣṇa's energy, so it is her duty to punish the conditioned soul because they have decided to forget Kṛṣṇa. Still, Kṛṣṇa is so merciful, He comes personally, He authorizes His devotees, servants, to enlighten these conditioned souls. Now our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an humble attempt to raise the standard of these conditioned souls to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are engaged in this business, they should personally behave as devotee, and by their example they should teach others and elevate them from this gross ignorance of materialistic life. Thank you very much. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Either by your books, by the dioramas and by the dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya, Haribol</span> Prabhupāda! [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what is your opinion, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They also have a performance to show you of Satish Chandra Ghosh's play. Satish Chandra Ghosh, remember that play that we received in Māyāpura, that Nitāi had translated? "Lust and Envy," you gave it to Madhudviṣa, myself and Sudāmā, and you were saying "Just think how to perform this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Satish Chandra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Ghosh. He's a playwriter. In Māyāpura we received two scenes from the entire translated in Vṛndāvana-in January when we were there together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Satish Chandra or Girish Chandra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Girish Chandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Girish Chandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Girish Chandra Ghosh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they've prepared one of his dramas also. We wanted to show you on Friday. Actually, we can show you Wednesday now. We'll only be leaving Thursday, Wednesday night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> It is incomplete. It is only the first two scenes, and the rest of the drama is four acts of <span class="Italic">caitanya-līlā.</span> So we are waiting anxiously for the rest of the drama to come. Presently it is incomplete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how'll you show the incomplete?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> In Māyāpura you were interested to see the first..., or see the scene of the enemies-anger, lust, greed, envy-so we have worked on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Kali, Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, Kali. So as the scenes come we are planning to work on them in that succession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have already worked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, on the first two scenes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have made a very accurate portrayal of the material world. Actually, the guests who come on Sundays, they very much appreciate these performances. I've seen myself sometimes at the end of the performance, they will give a very big ovation of applause. For even one, two minutes in a row, they continue to applaud. They very much appreciate it. People are fond of seeing things enacted, theater and dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally attended by Indians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, all the guests come. No, actually this kind of performance will be more appreciated even, I mean the ordinary American people will very much appreciate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. Usually at least half or more of our attendance on Sunday is from the Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And here in New York is very much a theatrical city, entertainment, Broadway and... This theater we have here in our temple is situated in off-Broadway. Our theater downstairs is as high a standard in its interior as any other off-Broadway theater house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are two classes, Broadway and off-Broadway theater. Two different classifications. Broadway is very costly, big productions, very elaborate, and off-Broadway is more simple, but also very often there are good plays there. So this particular temple is located in an off-Broadway location. And actually it's very prestigious. We can advertise, and people will attend. They will definitely attend, and they'll even pay for the performances. We don't feel that we should charge yet, until the caliber of the performance is first class and until they have some full program. Because right now, just like this play only took about..., the dance only took about twenty-five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Altogether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Unless they have something that is at least two hours, one and half, two hours, you cannot charge for. People will definitely pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pay or not pay, doesn't matter. They should understand the meaning.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did you feel that the message of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> came through?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The precedence of our work, Śrīla Prabhupāda, should definitely be that the message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is clearly understood by all, is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Along with it, if you, the same thing, more demonstrative, if you put some movies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Slides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Slide or movie, that will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Mixed media. That is also very much appealing to the public. Our future projection plan is to work on the advent of Lord Kṛṣṇa for Janmāṣṭamī, which is about an hour production, to an hour and a half. And then we were planning to work on the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> if it was suiting or agreeable by Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole basic principle is this, that people should understand, as I was explaining this morning, the <span class="Italic">sat</span> and <span class="Italic">asat.</span> So at the present moment we are living in the way that is <span class="Italic">asat.</span> But there is another life, <span class="Italic">sat.</span> So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an educational movement to raise a person from the <span class="Italic">asat</span> platform to the <span class="Italic">sat.</span> Under illusion they are, what is called, amock? They (laughs) have gone amock. So it is a humble attempt to stop their, this suicidal policy. They are practically committing suicide. They do not know what is the value of life and how they are spoiling it, this valuable life. <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> They are trying to adjust things by the arrangement of external energy. That is not possible. Whatever adjustment they are making, so many big, big leaders, politicians, they came. Napoleon, Hitler, Gandhi, this, that, by the waves of material nature everything is driven away. In that way there is no possibility of adjustment. It is not... <span class="Italic">Kathacaturamanam mali mali javanam(?)</span> How many, <span class="Italic">caturānana. Caturānana</span> means Brahmā. They come and go, come and go. And there is no permanent life, it is all <span class="Italic">asat.</span> So they should come to the <span class="Italic">sat</span> platform, that is perfect. The more you remain strong in your spiritual life, then more it will be impressed, it will act. And if it actually is not spiritual life but theatrical performance, then it will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Hmm. Very important. In your book you say that when it is acted by pure devotees, then it is powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do your best, try your best. That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Thank you, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
