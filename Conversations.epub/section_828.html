<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> One boy I recommended for second initiation, but during the fire ceremony he was away on traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> for Vṛndāvana. Will he be able to take initiation from you and have the ceremony later, before you go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And he can offer in the fire later on. Very nice. He's a very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Prabhupāda, there has been discussion amongst many of the members of the press and the Sanskrit editors regarding the actual place of Nṛsiṁha's pastimes. So I told them that on the occasion of our travel to South India we visited this place Ahobilam, and the <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> they have scriptural reference from the <span class="Italic">Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa</span> and the <span class="Italic">Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa</span> that the place is actually mentioned there, and it has been recognized by Rāmānujācārya and many of the great Ālwār saints. And yourself have already told me twice personally that this was the actual place where it happened. And on top of the mountain there, there is the pillar, iron pillar, which is the symbol of the spot where Lord Nṛsiṁha killed Hiraṇyakaśipu. So for the benefit of all of these devotees, they were just requesting your actual confirmation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Confirmation or no confirmation, Nṛsiṁhadeva is our worshipable Deity, that's all. Why you are bothering where He killed Hiraṇyakaśipu? You worship Him, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They just wanted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The question came up because they have some pictures, photographs from these places, and we wanted to know if they were suitable for publishing or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are bothering with that? Let it be accepted or not accepted. Worship Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Not that important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the important thing. [break] A man is diseased. He has gone to the physician. So whether is the first duty to investigate wherefrom the disease came or to cure him? Which is important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> To cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, Nṛsiṁhadeva might have done this or here or there, but He is our worshipable Deity, that's all. Why bother with unnecessary things? We know Nṛsiṁha is everywhere. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara stha paramāṇu cayān... </span>That is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> We were just afraid that if we published a picture that was not correct, then you might become like Nṛsiṁhadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> We were afraid that if we were to publish a picture that is not correct...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when it is disputed, why should you publish that picture? It is controversial. You should not print.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> The controversy is only amongst the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. As soon as there is little controversy.... I explained yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> For <span class="Italic">dhātun</span>?(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the crow, the crow and the <span class="Italic">tāla </span>fruit. Somebody said this; somebody said this. Then what is that important thing? Crow and a <span class="Italic">tāla.</span> You know the <span class="Italic">kāka-tālīya-nyāya</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I never heard that story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a tree, <span class="Italic">tāla</span> tree, and.... <span class="Italic">tāla</span> tree. So one crow was there, and the <span class="Italic">tāla</span> fruit fell down. Two <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> they began, "Whether the <span class="Italic">tāla</span> fruit fell down.... Because the crow sat down on it, therefore fell down." The other said, "No, the <span class="Italic">tāla</span> fruit was falling down, and the crow could not sit on it." And they began to fight: "No, this." He said, "No this, no this," go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Or maybe the crow tried to eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I think in this case it was just a question that they never knew actually what was the actual position. But if Your Divine Grace does not wish anything to be published regarding that place, then we will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as there is some controversy, avoid it. That's all. <span class="Italic">Tāla </span>fruit and crow. You worship Nṛsiṁhadeva. <span class="Italic">Ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato, yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ.</span> Nṛsiṁhadeva is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bahir nṛsiṁho hṛdaye...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why Nṛsiṁha should be confined: "He was here"? He is everywhere. And as He is everywhere, He is here also. That's all. Finish the business. And you are without...? (shoes?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I missed it. I could not get my <span class="Italic">cappalas</span> (sandals) off in time. They were lost. But that is okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is not okay. It is not at all okay. Then you go and sit down. Don't.... That is very risky. Then let us go to the road. [break] Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> [break] ...that just as a capitalist sees money everywhere and a lusty person sees sex life everywhere, devotee sees Kṛṣṇa everywhere, even in a pillar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> I've been reading a lot in the different books about envy. You say that people kill cows only out of envy. I was wondering if you could give a definition of what envy is. I don't understand why they would kill animals out of envy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Envy means the cow has got right to live. He does not allow the cow to live. That is envy. You cannot understand this? Suppose you are walking. You have got right to walk, I have got, and if I kill you, you cannot walk. That is envious. Everyone has got right to live. Just like the camel. God has given their food. They are accustomed to eat these thorny twigs. So Kṛṣṇa has given that. Let them eat and live. Why should you interfere with his living condition? [break] Do not interfere with others' right. Why should you? [break] ...think we shall take the car in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I think it's a good idea because there is no suitable place to store it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can make a suitable place. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It may take some time. I don't.... Actually I haven't been to Bombay myself. I haven't seen the land at Juhu. Is there a suitable place for...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is many suitable place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The reason was that because whenever you come back to India, you always come back to Bombay first of all, so as soon as you come back to India, you'll have facility to use your car. Otherwise we should make arrangements for another car for Bombay also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Another Mercedes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A Rolls Royce next time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) No. [break] ...land you can utilize. Where is.... They say overpopulation. Where is man? Overpopulation in the city. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> Kṛṣṇa has His own plan. Even overpopulation Kṛṣṇa provides. Why you are worried, "overpopulation"? You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why you are worried about overpopulation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> "We are less worried now with the family planning program."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> "With the family planning program the worry is decreasing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Decreasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They will argue like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Family planning, why family planning? Family planning is already there that don't marry. Why don't you accept this? Don't have sex. This is real family planning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> "That is horrible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> "It is horrible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Might as well kill ourselves."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not horrible. It is horrible for a particular person. Otherwise.... [break] <span class="Italic">Karma-bandhana.</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They are flowers. These are the flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In little pots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fruits also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're just some kind of little string bean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Like a bean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Birds and camels eat the bean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Our ISKCON population rate is less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> However, in some of our centers it tends to increase quite a bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you made the statement the other morning that if someone kills a young child, it is condemned. So if someone is killing the young child within the womb, that also should be condemned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Simply that they have no clear idea what consciousness is and what life is. Therefore all these things are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All rascals. How they are risking their own life, <span class="Italic">karma-bandhana.</span> Just like a thief. He is thinking "I am doing very nice business. Without any..., I am getting so much money." That is risky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri: :</span>Perhaps we cut across this way? This is a dead end here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we shall come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> You gave that other example in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that Nṛsiṁhadeva let Hiraṇyakaśipu slip from His hands for a little while just to play with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> The Vedic civilization is centered around villages, not cities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> If we want to make the world Kṛṣṇa conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic civilization is in the forest. Go to the forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Renounce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Neither in the city nor in the village. Go to the forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But there were cities like Dvārakā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, but the ideal is <span class="Italic">vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Go to the forest and depend on Kṛṣṇa and live there. And that is perfection. <span class="Italic">Vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Go to the forest and remain, depending on Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> There are no forests left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The whole material world's a forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many forests in America, full of forests still. Africa, so many forests, big, big forests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> [break] ...Kali-yuga we cannot do that due to our conditioning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari śauri: :</span>Fifth Canto describes the whole material world is a forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Forest of enjoyment. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They go in the village for begging little food, that's all. Just like you can live in this forest. And what you will eat? Two <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span> So you can go and beg. That's all. Whole day's business finished. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> It's too simple to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> It's so simple, we cannot realize how simple it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But if we tried to do that, wouldn't it be sort of artificial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
