<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda? Śatadhanya Mahārāja and Bhakti-caru went to Mathurā and they called Calcutta. They spoke with Adri-dhāraṇa? So he's going to bring the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span> has no telephone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he has one. He has telephone at home and in his chamber also. But when we rang up, he was not at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore we thought it best not to lose any more time but to call Adri-dhāraṇa, because he's proved to be very capable person-he was living with the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> when he was here-and we want Adri-dhāraṇa to bring the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> personally anyway. Also, Girirāja and myself were just with the registrar and we made the correction on the name without any difficulty, so now it's correctly given as "Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust." I wanted that because whenever we gave money from the Trust, I wanted to make a plaque with your name on it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I thought that would be a nice thing to do. This way, now your name will be properly given. So Śrīla Prabhupāda? The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will be coming quite soon, and I was thinking that you've been a very good patient, taking all of the medicines which he prescribed. So we should not discontinue it until he comes, because that way we can say to him that you have taken everything exactly as he recommended. That way, he'll know certainly how much his medicine has been effective. If we stop the medicine, then he won't be able to tell exactly. And as he'll be here quite soon, I think that we should just finish taking the medicine until he comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another thing that we were thinking, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we could see that you don't have much strength for sitting up very much at all. So what we were wondering was that just for the few times that you have to drink, whether we could sit you up for a minute. Not for longer than a minute. Not that you would have to have pillows behind you or anything. Bhavānanda Mahārāja and myself can help you to sit up. And just for a minute, while you drink, you could sit up and then lay down again, just until the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> comes. Our only feeling is that let us just try this medicine till the end. Let us see if it works. Let the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> come, and then he will give us some guidance from there. To sit up for any length of time is not possible. We could see that this morning. But if you try, we can help you to sit up. Bhavānanda and myself will both be behind you, and just while you drink, and then lay down immediately. So that will give you a little strength, drinking something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am, lying down like this, comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So we will keep you laying like this all the time. Just a few times that there's something to drink, we'll personally pick you up. Then you can drink easily. Then we'll immediately lay you down again. You won't have to sit up for any reason except just only for drinking. Will that be all right? And we'll help you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It won't be any strain. You feel comfortable laying like this? (pause) Śrīla Prabhupāda, your hands are just like lotus petals. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no appetite, how there will be strength?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, unless there is appetite, there cannot be any genuine strength. Let us see what this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> finally says, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We have to say that he seems to have at least given medicine which has done what he said it would do. That much we have to admit. He did not promise that the medicine would give strength yet. Let him come and let us see. He's a very honest man. He admitted that he cannot guarantee that he can save Śrīla Prabhupāda. He said, "But if anyone can, I promise you that my medicine is effective. I make it myself, and I do it according to the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> So if Kṛṣṇa desires, then medicine will have effect of saving Prabhupāda." So that's honest, at least. He's not claiming to be some magician, neither his medicine causes any pain, I think. Sometimes not so tasty, but not painful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Upendra wanted to clean you a little bit. Is that all right? Then after about a half hour or so we'll come back. He's going to clean you now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? When Upendra gives you your bath, there's some parts of your body he'd like to use soap on. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soap? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Some parts. Like on your upper leg is getting caked from oil and dirt. Just a little soap will take that off, and it will be nice and clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hot water is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> We can't use hot water. It's a dry sponge, just a hot sponge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can manage, I'll not...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. So we'll be back in a little while, Śrīla Prabhupāda, after you get bathed. And we will not ask you to do anything exerting. Sometimes only Bhavānanda and I will personally sit you up for a minute only to drink something. And then <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will be here very shortly. Then he can give the advice what to do. We simply want to give one try with this <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> If it doesn't succeed, then we simply... I'll lock my office and we'll simply chant <span class="Italic">hari-nāma.</span> But as we are a little hopeful... That is our... We can't stop being hopeful, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I was seeing a picture of Your Divine Grace sitting in a <span class="Italic">vyāsāsana</span> in New York, handing the initiation beads to some devotee. You had a very big smile as if you were joking with him. So I was just thinking how nice it was, that you could again be able to sit and talk nicely with all the devotees. So like that, hope is there in our hearts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In any case, we'll make sure that you're not made uncomfortable, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and not disturbed in any way. And we won't be the cause of any disturbance. So we'll come after a short time, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] (harmonium playing) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Sometimes when I used to come you were sleeping. I'll sit for one hour and then went out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Things are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhagatji was working very hard, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Too hard. Sometimes he missed his meals in the last two days to do that. I never saw... Even a young man could not work so much as he worked in the last two days. Śrīla Prabhupāda? I think we can... If you allow, Bhavānanda Mahārāja and I can sit you up for a minute to drink a little barley milk? Then you can lay down and take good rest. Taking a little warm thing at night is helpful for sleeping. It's relaxing. We never were used to that, but since we met Your Divine Grace, we're always taking a little warm milk at night. So you'll allow us to give you a little? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Bhakti-caru Prabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm simply praying that Kṛṣṇa in your stomach accepts everything, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Would you like to lie down now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pass urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll lay you down, and you'll pass urine. Okay. We're just getting the bottle. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali or Hindi conversation with Indian man)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tomorrow Svarūpa Dāmodara is giving a lecture in Agra, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In Agra? In some university?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Agra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Agra, which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Agra which university, Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Agra University is composed of several colleges. It's called Agra College, actually. It's the biggest university in Agra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> And Agra University is the biggest university in UP.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Many students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> It contains many colleges outside Agra also. Just in Aligarh, in Mathurā, all are affiliated to Agra University. All other universities in UP are local universities, just like Allahabad, Benares, Lucknow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, our Bon Mahārāja's, that is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Affiliated to Agra University, this quarter, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some people came here to the temple from Manipur today, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Did you preach to them, Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. They are very impressed. They said they'll come many. They told me they're going to come in many numbers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about that temple in Manipur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I was thinking that we can start...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Receive them nicely. The Manipuri is devotee. Receive them nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Didn't some Manipur devotees visit Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Jagannātha Purī sometimes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are all Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Just on the western gate of Jagannātha Purī there is also a place for Manipur. Devotees there, they serve Lord Jagannātha in Purī, special section for Manipur on the western gate of Jagannātha Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Navadvīpa there is Manipur Mandir. Here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the Maharani of Manipur Mandir in Navadvīpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In Vṛndāvana also Prabhupāda there is one? Which is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Sevā-kuñja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Sevā-kuñja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Also in Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Rādhā-kuṇḍa there is, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That Sevā-kuñja is under the charge of the Manipuri devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manipur devotees are very enthusiastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is Svarūpa Dāmodara. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Agra University, you lectured professors?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, professors and students, mostly the professors, from all departments: physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They also asked me to bring a film from the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. So I'm going to show the "Spiritual Frontier" just after the lecture. So I'll go with the Fairchild, the movie projector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. When you have to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The lecture is at 3:15, so I'll go about 11 because I like to also talk personally with some professors to become members of the Institute. That's one of our projects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara is enrolling members, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> To build his Bhaktivedanta Swami Institute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. How many members you have so far?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We have, so far, four. But one of the biggest men in Agra Medical College, Dr. Malviya, he became a member. He's a very well known biochemist. So he told me that he's going to contribute articles. We would like members, the professors of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It seems like there is a good future for Bhaktivedanta Institute, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will be president?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who will be president? Of the institute, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who will be present? President of the meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, it's arranged by the head of the chemistry department. There's one professor called Gupta. He's very enthusiastic. And there are also several professors who came to our conference. All of them are arranging together. There's one Dr. Sukla, also there's one Dr. Sharma. Three, four of them are organizing the lecture. They have... Most of the people I found there, they have great respect for ISKCON, and they appreciate Śrīla Prabhupāda's activities so much. I also requested them it is their responsibility to actually try to spread the genuine knowledge as a real science, scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Stories and fables will not convince them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I want to briefly outline tomorrow the comparative presentation of two aspects of modern science versus the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the varying concepts of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We'll outline, saying that modern science thinks that we are children of chance and chemical reactions. But the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> says we are children of Kṛṣṇa. We are coming from the supremely conscious person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So these two views, completely opposed. And I'm going to propose that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is a common sense. There is mother and there is children. Where is the father? They have no common sense even. Everything is produced... There are four kinds of living entities: <span class="Italic">udbhid-ja, sveda-ja, aṇḍa-ja</span> and <span class="Italic">jarāyu-ja.</span> They do not know anything. You are taking account of the <span class="Italic">jarāyu-ja,</span> Not <span class="Italic">udbhid-ja, sveda-ja, aṇḍa-ja.</span> They think the trees are coming automatically. That is their theory. That's not fact. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 14.4]<span class="Italic">. Bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not consider this. A bug is coming from bed-they think it is automatically. No? The <span class="Italic">bīja-pradaḥ pitā...</span> There are four kinds of births.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Four kinds of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Births.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">jarāy...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Man, animal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Womb is everyone. That comes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sweat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's one. And womb. Egg. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> And <span class="Italic">aṇḍa-ja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṇḍa-ja,</span> from eggs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Udbhid-ja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eggs, sweat, womb...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Udbhid-ja.</span> They take account of the <span class="Italic">jarāyu-ja,</span> not other three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Embryo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, embryo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So science means to know everything, not only theoretically. They say "automatically."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Their knowledge is so unscientific, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The knowledge that they propose, chance, is so unscientific. Sometimes I wonder. In the name of science they make the most unscientific remarks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The answer is there: "Here is my father." They'll not accept. Without father, how there can be son? You do not know who is the father. Why the particular tree is giving particular fruit, particular flower, and this is exactly like...? What do they answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They actually have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) From the rose tree, why rose flower come, not other flower? This is a species. <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.</span> They have no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Without coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness it's not possible for them to understand. That is the root cause, that they're trying to assume that everything is coming out of chance. But once they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These people, <span class="Italic">Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna,</span> they spoke in Hindi. So there were so many foreigners. If Kṛṣṇa consciousness is meant for Hindu or Hindi, not for others, what do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are... They only spoke in Hindi. That means they're very narrow-minded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Kṛṣṇa conscious. And Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ bīja-prada..., sarva-bhūtānām. "Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They don't have even the human respect of a gentleman. The real gentlemen, they won't speak like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For their dealings, they are compact within India. They cannot go out. Who will care for their Hindi? And their nationalism and at the same time they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are so many false attempt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They don't understand the spirit of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, during the two days that they held their meeting, we distributed about thirty thousand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> around the world. Every day we distribute at least ten thousand <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> per day in different languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā sañjaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This year, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we will have distributed about two million <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās,</span> in different languages. One year. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He says that the swelling is much less than before, and there is no weakness in the heart also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everything is going nicely except that the strength is going away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Right, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> When did Śrīla Prabhupāda take foodstuff last?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Foodstuff? <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭi? </span>Rice? About four months ago.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He took a little bit about a month ago, but it was very little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Since he left we haven't done <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the news of Māyāpura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Actually everything is going very nicely now. Everyone was... When the news came that you were coming, it spread just like electricity. All of a sudden, all Gurukula boys, all devotees, they started to cry out, <span class="Italic">"Haribol! Haribol!"</span> jumping up and down. Just within a few moments everyone was immediately jumping. Now the book distributors, they've been very eager to fulfill your order to do hundred thousand books. So already last month they did almost forty thousand. Last week they did twelve thousand books. One party in Assam, they were selling Bengali, mostly Bengali books. They did seven thousand books in one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Which book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Gītār Gān</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavānera Kathā</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seven thousand. That's pretty good, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in one week, just for one party. And they have four parties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Well, now there's two. But... So we are organizing now so that we'll be able to even distribute thirty, forty thousand big books in a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Well, this <span class="Italic">Vairāgya Vidyā,</span> that will be printed in two weeks, so then we will distribute that. In English there's good scope also, because in my zone, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, they are English-predominated state because the Christian missionary have converted everyone. But they found great reception there, although the Christians are... Even the Christians are buying. There seems to be a lot of land for sale right now. About 60 to 80 <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land is for sale, and the people are asking the market rates. So it's... We don't have to depend on acquisition. We can just go and buy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you... If you are able to... (mic moving) Subscribe within our jurisdiction so much land. Otherwise they will sublet(?) it. Why you have purchased agricultural land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We will purchase in the... We'll get a permit from the government to hold more land. And until that time, then we'll purchase in the name of Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, Svarūpa Dāmodara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? We can also purchase in the name of Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> A trust can hold fifty <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of irrigated land, seventy <span class="Italic">bighās</span> unirrigated. And once we turn that... If we turn that to nonagricultural land, then there's no limit. By paying twice the land tax we can convert to nonagricultural for the purpose of building our temple or building anything, and then it's no longer subject to any ceiling. We will see with lawyer very carefully that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you can purchase in Svarūpa Dāmodara's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This land is for sale from whom? Muhammadans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, both Muhammadan and Hindu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should we buy this land, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? You have got money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. There is enough money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We do not want to rest until every home in Bengal has a copy of <span class="Italic">Gītār Gān</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Gītār Gān</span> is nice. It's attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> About ten new devotees are there now. Every week two or three new devotees are coming. Four of them are college graduate. They're helping answering letters and transcribing. Subhaga has five books that he had written in England. So we got those, and now they're being copies for printing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Small books. <span class="Italic">Beyond Birth and Death, Easy Journey.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Subhaga is doing nicely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. Same as usual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Is there Bengali boys, Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So how many members are there now, devotees in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I don't know. I didn't take the exact count. Two hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two hundred. Big <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I'm thinking of bringing some Manipuri boys to Māyāpura next time I go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Bring some boys from Manipur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Manipur boys are very good workers. We saw them in Bombay. Remember, Śrīla Prabhupāda? I brought three of them to meet you. They all looked like Svarūpa Dāmodara junior. Very humble, intelligent, hard-working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The Manipur Mandir in Navadvīpa, when I was gone they had sent an invitation for attending one function. They're very favorable. When the party went to Assam, then they got invitation to go to Tripura, which is next to Manipur. It's eighty percent Bengali-speaking and also many Vaiṣṇavas. So we expect to distribute many books there. Next month party will be going to Tripura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Book distribution has hit India, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was thinking that it's very important... We want to complete this temple during your stay here on this planet. Then your life's mission will be... There won't be anything that's left uncomplete if we could just complete the temple. The present... Just meditating that what are the obstacle... Actually we have already enough land for the temple itself, but the temple design... When you first came to Māyāpura, then the temple was going to be 225 feet. Then we asked Saurabha to make a design, and then he made 300 feet. At that time the estimate was fifteen million. Then again he was designing, designing, and it went to 350 feet. Then it went to thirty million. Then it went to 400 feet, fifty-five million. Now it's up to seventy million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Dollars. Every time he thinks about it, he adds fifty feet, and it goes up twenty million. So now all the distributors in the world, they were very eager to see the temple built, but at the present time it requires so much money at seventy million dollars and 450 feet that no one can think of even starting it for five years. But if the temple was 300 or 350 feet and twenty-five or thirty million dollars, which I don't think anyone-it would be the biggest building even in India and the biggest temple in the world-then it could be started immediately, feasibly. Four temples in America said that if they just get five women each, that means twenty women from the Society, then they could each pledge 25,000 rupees a month for..., in collection. That means $125,000. Plus BBT's $100,000 a month and Gurukṛpā, that would be enough immediately even in the coming year to start the construction of the temple, simply if Saurabha was asked to just make the temple on a thirty million dollar budget, which would be 350 feet or 300 feet. And this is really inspiring the book distributors to have this temple begun, and to complete it within your lifetime, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My lifetime... (laughs) It is now very brief. At any moment I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We're all praying that Kṛṣṇa will give your strength back. [break] ...neophyte devotees. Without your inspiration, association, it'll be very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Muhammadan, what is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Back side our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Badusheik.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is selling the land also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is he selling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Right now he's still asking four thousand rupees, but he seems to be weakening. But he hasn't come down yet in his price. He's not coming around so much because now they have to go regularly to the jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> How often?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They were going once a day. Now it's once a week. So it's a big trouble for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Including him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, he's one of them. He has to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's one of the men who was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He's one of the main instigators.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You should tell him that if he sells at 2000 rupees a <span class="Italic">bighā</span> that we will not be so severe with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> To say stuff like that is very dangerous. They use that, how to say that, in court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa worked with this man. He was harassing us and now he is harassed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to three thousand you can take. Four <span class="Italic">bighās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And make a <span class="Italic">dighi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. That Praphulla <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> or Prabhupāda dāsa or whatever he's called, next door, he has built a small temple now. The dome has come up. It's about 45 feet high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On top?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Temple with a dome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Very narrow one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is he friendly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's very friendly. He came by and he said that... He recommended about two months ago that for a while we shouldn't say anything to the Muhammadan. Then he will bring the price down. Then mutually we can decide that who will take the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He wants the land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He doesn't know if he has the money to buy the land, but he has got some interest to get the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because he only has one <span class="Italic">bighā</span> right now, and that land is just next to his.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Planting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now planting is going on. Already many flowers and vegetables have been planted, and now the wheat fields are being plowed for planting. [break] ...if the big temple was thirty or thirty-five stories high, there would be any harm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No harm. It is too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The present design is too much. Yes, the present design means that every month, six hundred thousand dollars would have to be given, and that's just too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Too much strain is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Also the tendency is that when you make an estimate, you're always higher. You say thirty million dollars-it's very likely that it will go more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yeah, so then consider. [break] ...his birthday was a couple days ago, and then he invited us. So I sent two <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> to his <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> for his birthday celebration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His temple is completed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His <span class="Italic">nātha-mandira?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I didn't ask, actually. I think he's a year older than Śrīla Prabhupāda? Or two years older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least one year. I want to develop Gauḍa-maṇḍala. So in <span class="Italic">yoga-pīṭha</span> they could not build even a <span class="Italic">darśana-maṇḍapa</span> in fifty, sixty years. So we can construct a, what is called, hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Without <span class="Italic">mandira.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No. Bhaktivedanta... Yoga Pīṭha Bhaktivedanta Hall. Bhaktivedanta Swami Hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> With bookstand. Prabhupāda has formed a trust, the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust, and its purpose is to develop Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. Prabhupāda's one idea is to build this <span class="Italic">darśana-maṇḍapa</span> at the <span class="Italic">yoga-pīṭha.</span> And another is to finish Śrīdhara Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">darśana-maṇḍapa</span> at his..., like that, to develop the different..., to encourage cooperation between the different Godbrothers in the temples. The members of the trust are myself and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja and Girirāja, Svarūpa Dāmodara, myself, Mādhava Mahārāja and Madhusūdana Mahārāja. Prabhupāda named those members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you think the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> All of your ideas, Śrīla Prabhupāda, are perfect. I am not someone to offer opinion. But if you ask, I think that actually, especially the <span class="Italic">yoga-pīṭha, nātha-mandira,</span> that's a very dynamic idea, and in general it must do good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We want cooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No more noncooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Generally the... Even Devānanda Gauḍīya Maṭha, they had invited us for the disappearance day of Keśava Mahārāja, but I wasn't present at the time. So generally now they're inviting us, and everyone seems to have the desire for more and more cooperation. Mādhava Mahārāja had talked with one, this leader of the Janasangha, now the Janata party constituent, who's Professor Bharati, Haripada Bharati. He's a big orator in the Bidansava.(?) So he's very pro-ISKCON and pro-Hindu. So he's coming out to Māyāpura the 20th and putting on a public meeting. It's being organized by the local Hindus. And in that time he'll be also visiting our temple. So he was told by Mādhava Mahārāja, who happened to meet him somewhere, that he should give us full support also. He mentioned that. And he's going to give a lecture, and in the lecture he's going to tell the Muslims that they should never do anything like this to another Hindu or Kṛṣṇa temple again. Otherwise their situation will be very... He said they'll be driven out. [break] Dāmodara Mahārāja, he comes around once in a while. I haven't seem him the last couple of weeks, but he's also helping in his way. Yesterday, from the Central Government, one I.B. officer, Inspection Bank officer, came. He said that he received telegraphic information that regarding my citizenship the government was having second thoughts, that maybe they would give it after all, and they requested him to find out my background information and give a recommendation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> In regard to the three-year visas, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa has secured that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually he did not secure it, because it's been given to all religious groups in India. Girirāja informed me. It's being given to all religious groups in India, that they can get three years. The government has passed it. It wasn't specially for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Hindu, Muslim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyone. Any of these groups that have foreign people in it now will be allowed to stay. It's a general decision. It wasn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Not of ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like to take rest now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. They must be tired. They traveled all night long. The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> didn't sleep at all, I heard. Is that true, Jayapatākā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. The flight was three hours delayed. Three hours he was sitting, and he didn't leave Calcutta... 8:00 flight left at 10:30, 11:00, and arrived in Delhi 1:00. Then it took to 5:00 to get here, so he's quite tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It did not start on time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, three hours delayed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The flight was late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So everyone can take rest now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Just seeing Your Divine Grace gives us so much strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If you can just request Kṛṣṇa to allow you to stay, Śrīla Prabhupāda... Everyone wants you to stay. (end)</div>
