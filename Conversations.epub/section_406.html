<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...a little doubtful that Kṛṣṇa is the Lakṣmī-pati, Nārāyaṇa, and those who are devotees of Kṛṣṇa, they become poorer. And Lord Śiva, who has no even a residential house, he lives under the tree, and the devotees of Lord Śiva they become opulent. So what is the reason? So this was questioned by Mahārāja Yudhisthira to Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa first answered that <span class="Italic">yasyaham anughrnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaiḥ:</span> "This is the first installment of My mercy." [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She became widow at the age of eighteen years. So my father engaged her in worshiping Deity. My father was worshiping, and she was the assistant. Of course, she had two children by that time. Yes, go on. [break] ...Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is all attractive. So immediately they attracted the other cows, although they were not actual mother. [break] ...doctor in Calcutta, young man, he married the daughter of a very rich man.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughter) He's a typical Bengali. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So actually, by his going round, he increased his practice. (Indians talking Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...between demigod. Demigods are also expansion, but that is separated expansion, separated expansion, <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Varāha-Purāṇa</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">vibhinnāṁśa.</span> And here, <span class="Italic">svāṁśa,</span> personal expansion.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (3):</span> I have worked with men of international fame like Colonel De Gaulle, Colonel Acton, Colonel Knowles, but worldwide... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you do not accept the soul, medical science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Soul is already everywhere. But what do you say? Everywhere means only on the earth, not away from the earth, and then outer space. You want to say... Do you mean outer space also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. <span class="Italic">Sarvaga. Sarvaga</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But these boys have to be kept in those living bags, with saturation of oxygen, who have been to the moon. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the statement in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, kṛṣṇa yei bhaje sei baḍa catur:</span> "Unless one is very, very extraordinarily intelligent, he cannot be a devotee of Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Svalpa-puṇya-vatāṁ rājan viśvāso naiva jāyate.</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is the statement of the <span class="Italic">śāstras:</span> "Those who are less pious, they cannot believe in Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">mahā-prasāda,</span> and the holy name." <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you have given some medicine.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Otherwise these modern researches would not have been brought into existence if there was no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is their nature, to differ.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, that's it. <span class="Italic">Muni</span> does not speak. <span class="Italic">Maunam.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why there is difference? [break] ...and Kṛṣṇa's power is compared. Brahmā's power is just like glowworm, and Kṛṣṇa's power is just like day sunlight. [break] The power displayed, they are of different degrees. That is the difference. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they say everything is water. They give that example. But the sea water, the force of the sea water, and the water in a pot, small pot, the degrees of force are different. In England it is very common to say, "Lord Chelmsford. Lord Chelmsford," do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We used to call him Chelemfor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So Chelmsford is a place, is a village. But he is called Lord Chelmsford. He is personified. Like that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There is one Lord Chelmsford or anyone else...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When his son becomes a Lord of Chelmsford and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, continues, continues. It is... What is called? They create aristocratic family. One has to deposit certain amount of money to the government and then the family...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Gets the title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gets the title "Lord." And to maintain their prestige the government supplies the interest of the money. And the first son becomes the inheritor. So in this way the Lord family continues. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...in the three qualities of material nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore a man in any quality-it doesn't matter whether he is in goodness or passion or ignorance-anyone can worship Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there is no restriction. <span class="Italic">Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra...</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]. Anyone is open to worship Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is open for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This scene and all those things showed to Brahmā was to teach him a sort of lesson to take out his ego from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That was the purpose. It was not that Brahmā was degraded, but Kṛṣṇa is merciful upon Brahmā and Indra. Hm. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Lord Viṣṇu, Brahmā also realized, was the reservoir of all truth, knowledge and bliss. He is the combination of three transcendental features, namely eternity, knowledge and bliss. He is the object of worship by the followers of the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads.</span> Brahmā realized that all the different forms of cows, boys and calves transformed into Viṣṇu forms were not transformed by a mysticism of the type that a yogi or demigod can display by specific powers invested in him. The cows, calves and boys transformed into <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-mūrtis,</span> or Viṣṇu forms, were not displays of <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā,</span> or Viṣṇu energy, but were Viṣṇu Himself. The respective qualifications of Viṣṇu and <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā</span> are just like fire and heat. In the heat there is..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Sanskrit) [break] So you stop. You stop only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give up, give up the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> First reading you don't mind following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So after all, we have got still the material body. Sometimes we get tired. That is also fortune. [break] That is the advantage of human life. You can check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Particular intelligence is given to human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The elephant has got so much intelligence, they say, as good as human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intelligence... Not only intelligence. Human life has got the discriminating power. <span class="Italic">Sad-asat.</span> (Indians speaking) [break] ...infected, how your medicine will be sold? [break] ...merchant, I will say like that.
