<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are weapons. That was the only endeavor, how legally he could occupy the bricks and stones of <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya Math.</span> That's all. He had no other ambition. How to push on Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, how to push on Guru Mahārāja's... He had no such. It was simply show. But real purpose was how to occupy, how to take the whole property. Business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And none of the other Godbrothers had strong preaching spirits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They also, when they saw that "This man is legally taking everything. <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya sannyāsīs,</span> we cannot go home. We must have some shelter." No spirit of pushing on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Even by your example they have not learned anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, my... Of course, I did not attempt in the beginning. I started my activities when I was seventy years old. So they thought, "This man is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He is embarassed with family life. What he'll do?" (laughs) That was their impression. But I never neglected. Guru Mahārāja told me. I was simply thinking, "How to do it? How to do it?" I thought, "Let me become a rich businessman. The money will be required." That was my thought. But Guru Mahārāja was asking me, "You give up this. I'll give you money." That I could not understand. I was planning. My plan was not wrong. But I was thinking "The money required, so let me earn some money. Then I shall begin." And Guru Mahārāja said, "You give up this money-earning endeavor. You come completely. I'll give you money." I can understand now. But my desire was there. Therefore he guided me. So I was... In 1936 or '35 in Bombay, after installation of Deity, so-I was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha-</span>I helped them to collect some money. All my Godbrothers applauded and recommended to Guru Mahārāja that "Abhay Babu is so influential. Why he lives outside the temple? He can become the temple commander and manage this Bombay temple. Why he is living outside?" Mean "Guru Mahārāja may ask him." So I was... From this Allahabad I was going to Bombay. I had one small office there. So after hearing, he said, "It is better that he is living little away from your <span class="Italic">Matha.</span> And when time will rise, he'll do everything. He hasn't got to be advised." I could not understand why he said like that. That means he was so kind that he expected that I shall do something. That was my asset, his blessing. And I was thinking that "His, this mission must be done very nicely." Although I was not capable to do anything, I was thinking like that. So desire was there and maybe blessing was there. Yes. There was no question of qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But still, after ten years the <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya Math</span> still has not learned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? They cannot. They... Those who are intelligent, they are making something, Śrīdhara Mahārāja and others. But this man was envious, this Tīrtha Mahārāja, because... He advertised that he is the only favorite student of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. (laughs) But spiritually he was empty. Materially he was capable, how to manage things. But spiritually he was zero. That Prabhupāda also knew and everyone knows. He had no spiritual understanding. Materially he helped Guru Mahārāja how to organize. Therefore he liked him, that "This man is expert manager."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have devotees like that. We also have devotees who spiritually have trouble coming to the programs and even chanting, but still, they like to give them service, so we engage them anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also qualification. That is also qualification. Some way or other, if there is some service, it goes to the credit. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya.</span> The foolish person may not know that "I am imperceptibly advancing even during my, this material life," but Kṛṣṇa takes. Just like Pūtanā. She gave service by allowing her breast to be sucked by Kṛṣṇa. Although her intention was to kill, but Kṛṣṇa took her as mother: "She has given Me service." This is Kṛṣṇa. "This rascal does not know that nobody can kill Me, but on some plea or other, she has given her breast open to be sucked by Me, and I have done it. Therefore she is My mother. She must get the promotion like mother Yaśodā." This is Kṛṣṇa. He is very anxious to deliver us. So any little service done, He accepts. "All right, come on. You are accepted." This is Kṛṣṇa. Little service. "Let him do something." So kind. He comes for serving you.(?) He speaks, "Rascal, you do this. Surrender to Me and do something. You'll be relived from this <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu vyādhi.</span>" "No." Hog, dogs, they are-what is called-obstinate. The hog, living in dirty place, eating stool, and if you try to deliver from this, he'll not: "No. No. I am living here happily. Why you are disturbing me?" This is the... "Why you are trying to wash my brain? This is very good life." This is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes we get <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> to join us, but they are not strong enough to do <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> So then we can encourage them to do some business like a normal <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> in the world, to give some money to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Kṛṣṇa... <span class="Italic">Svakarmana:</span> "All right, be engaged in your occupational duty."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just give something. Actually, if some <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> would do some business, it would take a little pressure off the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> and they can pass out more books. Now because the overhead is high in certain temples like New York, very high overhead, LA, very high, so we are collecting so much money. We could be giving out more books if we had extra money from the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha's</span> business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are willing to work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think if we encourage them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...we can start some businesses. Just like Spiritual Sky was started. It is giving every month to Los Angeles five thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can do business. Why don't you start this toothpaste? It is very effective. I am using personally. Toothpaste is a very common thing. If you introduce, it is used by cent percent persons. Simply they should like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The taste is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, taste can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Adjusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America everything is based on the tongue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere. Taste can be very nice, sweetened. There is salt, and you can add honey also. Naturally salty and sweet plus some ingredients like peppermint, wintergreen, camphor, it will make tasty. These ingredients are very nice. We can... Some ordinary medicament. That skin disease ointment, some cough mixture. I have got experience in all these things. If you want to introduce this kind of business, tidbit...(?) The <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> can do the business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Gṛhasthas.</span> I also want to start this record...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot expect everyone to be brahminical qualification. We are neither <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor... We do not belong to any sect, but Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, we can do anything. That, because we are doing some business, we are not <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> Just like Nanda Mahārāja was agriculturist. So that does not mean he was a Vaiṣṇava. But professionally, externally, he looked like a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I see that in Los Angeles. Not everyone can follow every program. So I'm always telling them, to encourage them, that even something is better than nothing. Blind uncle is better than no uncle. So do whatever you can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they should be encouraged. They must give some service to the institution. By earning money, that is hard-earned money. (man chanting on loudspeaker in background) So why our men are not chanting? This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're just starting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's also stressing on chanting, this man, Punjabi. He is stressing that "Mind is restless. Chant. The mind will be controlled."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually, by reading your books millions of Americans are chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just by reading your books it is chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Within the mind they are hearing the message of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are some cartoons. One old lady is requesting her husband, "Chant! Chant! Chant!" and the husband is saying, "Can't! Can't! Can't!" You did not see that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And another big businessman, he is coming from business and sitting: "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" These cartoons are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yet now there is a new controversy in America because during Christmas season our book distributors dress themselves up as Santa Claus. You've seen Santa Claus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very fat, white beard. Christians got very angry. They think that Santa Claus is Christian, so we are impersonating to take advantage. But we were arguing that "This Santa Claus is not Christian or Jewish. He is devotee of God." Originally Santa Claus is a saint, Saint Nicholas. So we were arguing, "How can you claim exclusive property of Christian? He is a servant of God. You are using this Santa Claus..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even Americans use also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "...to sell liquor and sell cigarettes." If you watch the TV, you see that they have commercials, and Santa Claus is encouraging people, "Buy liquor," "Buy cigarettes." But we are using Santa Claus, encouraging people to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...read book. Anyway, there was some controversy, and they had this one cartoon, I sent it, outside the place where Lord Jesus was born, and the father of Jesus is seeing outside. There are three Hare Kṛṣṇas playing <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But dressed as Santa Claus. And he is saying, "Would you believe Hare Kṛṣṇa?" So that actually is very good for us, that cartoon. They are putting us with Jesus. For them to do that is very good for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. Somehow, whatever we do now, they find some fault and then they write about it in the newspaper, and millions of people read about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Hare Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya.</span> Any way, if something is done in this connection, it becomes an asset.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now, this Governor of California, he invited us to assist him for helping the conditions in these mental retarded hospitals. So that is like mundane charity, in one sense. So is it all right for our men to take some time? Because the end result will be that we will become appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, you do. Wherever we get opportunity, we shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We can teach them to chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is our medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But, of course, the main thing is that the governor, he is not inviting us so much to give religion. He wants...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is our method to cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not religion. "You have invited, so this is our method of curing, 'Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.' " And that's a fact. Go there, prepare <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> offer to the Deity, ask them to chant in the school(?). Who will object to this? There cannot be any objection, anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, except that there is this controversy that if you chant, you are limiting your brain, washing, brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our treatment. If you want that treatment, this is our treatment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So I have been thinking for some time... I have discussed this idea with Yadubara, because you wrote in your letter to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa that we should use movies also to convince them. So I had this idea to have a movie photographing India at different places...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In movie there is chanting, dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I was thinking to show that chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is very old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There are temples all over India, and... A movie about Vaisnavism, not so much just Hare Kṛṣṇa, but Vaisnavism in general. Now, in the colleges in America they are always eager to have movies about Hinduism, Muhammadanism, Buddhism, for showing to their students, but whenever they have a movie about Hinduism, it is all bogus, many gods, many demigod worship, nature worship. And the people who make these movies for college classes have no conception. So I was thinking, if we make a scholarly movie about Vaisnavism...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Do. You can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...which will convince people that chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is very accepted in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You take... You take this. I'll give you hint. You can develop it. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> The beginning is hearing about Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavatam.</span> Big, big <span class="Italic">sabhā,</span> you'll find many Vaiṣṇavas chanting. They are reciting <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and hundreds and thousands are hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Show the nine devotional processes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the nine devotional process and how, by each process, one becomes perfect, just like Parīkṣit Mahārāja, simply hearing, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī, simply chanting, reciting <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> So both of them got salvation. Lakṣmī, she is simply <span class="Italic">pāda-sevanam,</span> giving massage to the lotus feet of the Lord. Arjuna simply made friendship with Kṛṣṇa. Hanuman simply worked as a hard servant. He doesn't know what He is... "Lord Rāmacandra wants it." Then it is done. Jump over. He does not know any philosophy. He has got bodily strength, so whatever Rāmacandra says, he'll do. He was asked to bring that medicine for Lakṣmaṇa. He did not know where to find it. "Take this whole mountain." (laughter) He was not intelligent. "Fight! We have to fight with Rāvaṇa. Then block his whole city by throwing stones and trees and dirt." Everything became blocked. They could not move. So in one side he is born of animal life, he had no higher intelligence, but his staunch desire, that "I shall serve Lord Rāmacandra..." By that... Only this desire made him perfect. <span class="Italic">Dāsyam. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> so <span class="Italic">smaraṇam.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja, five years old boy, how he could protest against such a powerful demon father? He was simply thinking of Kṛṣṇa, "All right, my father is punishing me. What can I do?" Simply absorbed, <span class="Italic">smaraṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One thing they will like to see in this movie is many different temples, beautiful temples from South India, and also Vaiṣṇava festivals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Like Ratha-yatra in Jagannātha Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the stories also, that how by executing one of the items a devotee became perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And show how they're doing those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...items in different <span class="Italic">sampradāyas</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This will show, this movie will show, that Vaiṣṇava is very authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is widespread. Because that... They are criticizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this, this, this <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ,</span> this <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> was cited just little after the creation. That means millions and millions of years ago. Now, not recently. Many millions and billions of years ago. That is the oldest. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whichever item you take, it is very, very... Just like this Parīkṣit Mahārāja. That is at least five thousand years ago. So where is the history of the human society in the Western countries? They cannot give history more than three thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They think it is simply caveman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prehistoric. They call it pre-history, living in caves, monkey men. Also I was thinking, in the movie they can take the testimonial of different scholars and professors in India about your books and about chanting as a process for awakening the mind, because they are accusing us that "By chanting, you are killing your brain." So if we take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, it is acting, rascal, on brain. We are teaching or giving them process. That you cannot understand. But our <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is so strong that it is acting on the brain. So why don't you take this side, that "If we are simply chanting and it is acting on the brain, even from your side, that it is so strong that we are giving up everything for this process. So how much this chanting is strong, why don't you see to that?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We can even take testimony from some scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...about chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Why it is happening? Why we have given everything. Our father, mother, our home, our comforts, our ideas, stereotyped, our religion, culture-everything we have given up. So don't you see the power of chanting? You may think it is bad, but see the power. Similarly, these diseased person, if they chant, it has got power to bring him in the normal condition. The power is there. It is already proved. You say it is brainwash, but the power is there. Reaction is there. That's a fact. You are admitting. So now, whether this reaction is good or bad, that you cannot judge because you are bad. But impersonally, if you judge, you see how the power is, that we were drunkards, we were woman-hunter, we were meat-eaters-we have given up. You cannot give up even smoking cigarette. So just this is the power. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span>" Why don't you take this side? The power is there. The electric power is there, either you use it for heater or for cooler. That is your na... But the power is there. Without this power, it cannot run on, either heater or cooler. Give them this recipe(?). "You have to admit. You are admitting that 'Your Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> working on the brain.' So the power is there. You have admitted."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, they admit the power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That is some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But we have to show them that it's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And "You do not know what is good. It is good. We have given up these bad habits, sinful life. It is not... But you have no idea that these are good. You have idea, but out of your definite malice you cannot appreciate. You are spending millions of dollars for giving up this LSD, and our power is so strong, as soon as one comes, he gives up. But you are so rascal, you do not appreciate. That means you are rascal. Our power is there; our reaction is there for good. That's a fact. But you cannot understand. You are so rascal; you are so fallen down. The same, like the hog. He does not know what is the..., how nice is <span class="Italic">halavā.</span> You give him <span class="Italic">halavā;</span> he'll not take it. He will take stool. That is his misfortune. It cannot say that <span class="Italic">halavā</span> is bad, but he cannot appreciate because he's hog. He'll prefer to eat stool. We are giving up these nonsense, nasty things. You cannot appreciate. 'Oh, they are giving up meat-eating? It is brainwashing.' You are so low, hog life." Tell them like that. "As the hog cannot appreciate what is the value of nice <span class="Italic">halavā,</span> similarly you cannot appreciate. Your brain has to be washed. Please come inside. We shall wash it." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that "You require to..., your brain to be washed. Then you'll understand the value of this. So let us treat you. Come here. You are a good candidate."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So far, the movies that Yadubara has made, the colleges will not use them in their religion classes so much because they are... They seem to be just religious propaganda for Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. So if this movie is made in a more scholarly way, the field is very good. They will use it in every college class all over the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which movie?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The one I'm thinking of having Yadubara make, shooting in India professors' and scientists' testimony plus Vaiṣṇava festivals and Vaiṣṇava temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that... And you'll see Tirupati, how they are standing for hours together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, like that. And also, if the movie is made very well, then we can make an excerpt...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they are contributing their hard-earned money, how it is, the are collecting money, huge amount.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, they'll interview very wealthy people also. Good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're not all wealthy. Wealthies are giving more, and poor men also give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But in America, if they see that a wealthy man is also worshiping Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...then they'll have respect for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If they think just poor people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...they'll not respect it as much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like... The temples are maintained by all the people. All the big, big kings... So you show how kings of Cuttack, they constructed a temple of... A temple construction is costly affair. How Mahārāja Mansingha constructed the Vṛndāvana costly temples. That is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If this movie is made properly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...I think we can even get it on television in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything done properly will be accepted. There is no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Our movies so far cannot be on television because they are too much Hare Kṛṣṇa propaganda. But if this is done in a way, they will not know that it is the Hare Kṛṣṇa propaganda, but it will be there anyway... It will be like a very scholarly, academic movie. And then they'll show it on television. They're eager. Because it's such a controversy about chanting and meditation, whether it is brainwashing or not, so if we make this movie, they'll put it on nationwide television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what you can do? You can show some temples or you can show some meeting of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> recital. That's it, two things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. And also festivals like Ratha-yatra, millions of people coming, big public festivals. I was thinking that Bhargava and Yadubara can travel together in India, because Bhargava has been to many places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And they'll also appreciate beautiful photography showing the beauty of India. They'll appreciate that also. And beautiful temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, it'll show the higher religious culture of India. That will impress many people in America. They think of India as so backwards, but they'll see that they have these beautiful temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is due to British propaganda. British propaganda was that they were staying in India to make India civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their big propaganda is that "India is so poor and they are so stupid, they are giving all their money to the temple, so they are remaining poor, so what is the use of this religion?" That was the propaganda, that "Religion is the opiate of the people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they do not... Therefore they are... The Indian rascals, they using this income of Bālaji for industry. They are bringing, that "The poor people, on account of their innocence, they are blindly, so..." Communist movement is against us because we are constructing costly temples, <span class="Italic">crores</span> and rupees. This could have been utilized in industry. That is their protest. Temple construction was practically stopped in India. And I have again revived. Nobody was interested to construct temple anywhere within the recent at least hundred years or fifty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Only the Birlas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, only Birlas, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America, if we collect money saying we are sending it to India, if we tell them we are sending it to build a temple in India, they will not give one penny. They think "India has too many temples. They need money for food, for technology."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can take money for food. That is also our program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, I'm going to try to develop this record business. I think we can make a million dollars a year, profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And send it for our farms, and we invite, "Come here. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, the farm communities. Oh, not just food relief, but also developing the farm projects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's food relief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, my project is that we shall actually give them food, shelter and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Cottages, little cottages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And cloth, whatever primary necessities and simple living, and let them chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They chant and also work the fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they, in the beginning, if they are not working... They'll work. We shall supply food, everything. And that... That is well beginning. In Hyderabad they are coming daily, two hundred people. And I kept with them fifty thousand rupees and told... But as soon I came, they have stopped, this, our Haṁsadūta. I do not know what is the reason. He said, "There is no money." I gave them fifty thousand rupees. He said, "There is no money." He's not good manager at all. It has been proved. He's not a good manager. Everywhere failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's very good at <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, that's right. He is sincere devotee and he's... But as soon as you give something to manage, he'll make a mess. (laughs) I have told him that "I shall pay you. You continue this <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> program." They are coming, up to two hundred. And now he has finished it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Two hundred people were coming every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every day. And that is little, simple <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Little <span class="Italic">kittri</span> would satisfy them. They're village people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they have to regular source of income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And so long there is no income, I shall supply food or money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This year I think I can spend some time developing this record. I'm sure we can make money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, make money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> With very little manpower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And send... Send grains. Send grains, food grains, and we shall utilize it in all our temples and farm projects in the beginning. Then they'll... Naturally they'll produce. As soon as they become little interested in our scheme, they'll give service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And this will also be a good angle for getting the record tax exempt. The books are already tax exempt, but not the record. So if the money from the record is going to be used for feeding people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...automatically they'll give us tax exemption.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually India is poor. When we give food, how voraciously they eat. They cannot eat. They have no resources to eat nicely at home. That's a fact. Half-fed. At least half-fed. In the villages they are not fully fed. They have no sufficient clothing, no food, that's all. The rascal politicians, realizing heavy tax, and that is divided amongst them. It is not going to the poor. They are imitating Western way of life. They have got huge expenditure. So whatever money is coming, they are spending for their luxury, and poor men... The Gandhi's movement, boycott British goods, but they took it: "Boycott British goods and take our goods." So the consumer goods were the same. Gandhi helped to stop the British capitalist in favor of the Indian capitalist. The consumer remained in the same position, rather, worse. The foreigners, they are thinking that "These people are poor. They cannot pay more to me." And these rascals, Indian capitalists, in the name of nationalism, Birlas and others, they exploit. And they give contribution to Gandhi, Gandhi's staff, Jawaharlal Nehru's staff. And they took the opportunity that "I shall pay this rascal one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> and I shall utilize the ten <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span>" That's it. So the object of exploitation remained the same. Rather, by artificial inflation of money market put common men in plight, because the other day I was calculating... The things have gone high priced, thirty times, but the income has not increased thirty times. The other day I was calculating. My father's income was, utmost, three hundred rupees. So we had no scarcity. In our standard of life there was no scar... What standard of...? That standard of life is still... Now that three hundred rupees is... He calculated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Price of gold, it was based on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We worked out the price of gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, gold standard. Gold standard... At that time gold was selling... My mother was purchasing gold for ornament at twenty rupees per <span class="Italic">tola.</span> Now the gold in India is six hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thirty times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that three hundred rupees is like nine thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nine thousand. And who has got nine thousand rupees' income?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Per month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That three hundred rupees is equal to nine thousand rupees now. Now, a middle class man, who has got nine thousand rupees' income? Maybe one thousand, two thousand... [break] ...same thing, thirty times. The same ghee is selling not less than twenty-five, up to thirty. Thirty times. Take anything, rice, dahl, wheat, two annas per seer. And now they charge two rupees, three rupees per kilo. So from two annas to two rupees, sixteen times more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> America also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, sixteen, thirty-two times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thirty-two times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You take average, thirty times more. Cloth, you could purchase very nice cloth, one rupees six annas. Now that is thirty rupees. So in this way proportionately, average thirty times, everything. Everything has increased thirty times. So I am speaking when we were child, say eight years-seven years, eight years old-or up to ten years. So I am now eighty-one. Seventy years ago and now, the difference is thirty times. We were purchasing milk, two annas per seer, and now it is three rupees per kilo. That is also, we do not know whether it is milk or some white water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In most cases it's white water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we were purchasing real milk (indistinct). So nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they may say this philosophy, that's like the communism, capitalism, Russia, America. The business of exploiting the masses is the same, they'll say. Different names, different dress, but the main business is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Expert. Nobody is thinking (indistinct) "Everyone will be happy." That we are thinking because we are devotees. Otherwise what is the use of my going to America? So America is not in need of me, but I found there is need of me. So they are thinking, "This man has come to wash our brains." And I think that "Yes, we are going to do work (indistinct) they will be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, could I ask one more question about the records?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Suppose we make a profit. Someone may enquire, "Isn't it better to use the money to distribute more books rather than giving it to the food program."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, books department, that is already sufficient income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I would personally like to use it for the food program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Book we are getting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that's the answer then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are not taking any profit. Neither the seller, neither the author is taking any profit. So there is enough money. You haven't got to pay either to the seller or to the writer, then why not spend the whole income? No profit. So we save income tax. And whatever little excess is there, (indistinct), advertise or pay some <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> some pocket expenses. In this way make it meet. No profit. By our arrangement there is no question of profit but even there is profit, we should pay the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> some expenditure. He has... Family man there is... In this way, make always no profit. I was doing from the very beginning (indistinct), then I began to sell books. I was working, I was selling, I was collecting, I was spending, going to the printer, everything. Forcing (indistinct) I was publishing. Work nicely. If I don't force (indistinct), they'll not give me the concession rate, still I am doing. So I think this book department (indistinct) all right, you don't require to invest. But whatever income you'll get from this record business, spend it for giving <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So we have got so many centers, they will feed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they... That way a whole new...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I started Māyāpura this <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution. And it is coming to be successful. People are, politicians are appreciating that here is Hindu-Muslim unity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All the devotees will appreciate this then. That the records now, the money is going to be used for food relief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we can increase. The same thing (indistinct) in the farm, in the village, "Come on, any number, I shall feed you. Come here, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" And we shall increase the quality of the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They will be very much pleased to come and chant. That I want. I am interested in these rascals (indistinct). Fighting amongst them. What can we do? You can go for some time, see what is the reason you have come. (indistinct) ...elderly person, he will come. (indistinct) younger brothers (indistinct) but that he has no power to do. Misunderstanding there will be, after all it is the material world. You go and see why (indistinct). I used to think like that. In all our temples the <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution should be so random (?), that within ten miles nobody should remain hungry. There are many persons in India, they are half time hungry. So if you distribute <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> "Come over here. You are hungry, take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> If I cannot supply daily, I'll supply at least two days, three days weekly." And they're coming. You have seen Māyāpura (indistinct). A big <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution hall. Regular two thousands are coming (indistinct). And Hindu, Muslim, they're sitting down. No (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is there any reason why we are just distribute on a Saturday and Sunday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, (indistinct) we can distribute every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Let them come every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is (indistinct). Otherwise (indistinct). Let them eat. They can eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they get a (indistinct) successful and they get regular amounts...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then they could increase that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think we can make a million dollars a year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> After it has been developed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And purchase grains. (indistinct) purchase books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I've studied but more Americans buy records than books. They spend more money buying records than buying books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But commercially there's some good potential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But do not neglect book sales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will not do. This is our first business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine, one question has come up. Now that England is printing their own, India is printing their own, so this magazine that we print in America, ninety percent, ninety-five percent is sold in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is English and in India vernacular so there is no question of competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Right. So the question is that the magazines in America, the readers like very much to have a feeling of who the author is, who the different writers are, the editors. So we are using our spiritual names on the list of writers and editors and so on. So they have asked me to enquire whether in parentheses they can also have their legal names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That way, because they cannot pronounce these names, Gopīparanadhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fine, allow this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then it seems like a foreign thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So should we have both names?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Use both names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think this will help the readers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...relate more. (pause) <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (pause) So where shall I wash my mouth? There?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) (end)</div>
