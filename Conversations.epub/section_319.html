<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give up your material activities and engage yourself in spiritual activities. That is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> Just like a man in diseased condition, he is acting. He is also acting. He is also passing stool, passing urine, eating something, lying down, talking. He has got activities. But that activities and when he is free from the disease, that activity is different. Similarly, if you change your activity, you can become <span class="Italic">mukta</span> even in this life. That is <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> real <span class="Italic">mukti. Muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you give up your diseased conditional activities... Just like these boys who are in Kṛṣṇa, they are <span class="Italic">muktas,</span> because they are not interested with any material activities. They are not interested to read in the morning any newspaper. No. They cannot waste their time in that way or take part in politics. No. They are simply interested in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and reading these books. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">muktas.</span> They are all liberated. Because <span class="Italic">hitvānyathā-rūpam.</span> Other people, they are reading newspaper, doing all nonsense, but they are not interested. The <span class="Italic">anyathā-rūpam.</span> That is material business. <span class="Italic">Svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<span class="Italic">. Svarūpa</span> means <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> Every living entity is eternally Kṛṣṇa dāsa. So if you give up these material activities and engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa's service, you are <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">It is confirmed. So anyone who is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> For them there is no demand for <span class="Italic">mukti. Muktir mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān.</span> Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura: "The <span class="Italic">mukti</span> is standing before me with folded hands, 'What can I do for you?' " Because he is <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> So for a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> there is no such demand, <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> Means they are <span class="Italic">muktas</span> already. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because He's <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> There may be again birth, but a devotee takes birth for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not for any other business. Therefore he is <span class="Italic">mukta. Jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate. Īhā yasya harer dāsye.</span> So <span class="Italic">mukti</span> is not very difficult thing. If you cent percent engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness business, you are <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> That is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> That is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Mukti</span> does not mean that I have got now one head, I will get four heads. No. This one head is sufficient, but it must be engaged for Kṛṣṇa. That is it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Hundred percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundred percent, yes. That's all. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> Any other question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. I have very many questions to ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. But you cannot assimilate all the answers in one day. That is not possible. You see. You have many questions, but ask in many days, not in one day. Otherwise you will get indigestion. (laughter) You will not be able to... Simply you go on questioning, questioning, and don't take anything. That is no use. Take. Make one question. Try to understand. Adopt it in life. Then make another question. Don't take all the answers at a time and become suffering in dysentery. No. (laughter) Don't do that. That's alright. You cannot take one month's food in one hour. Can you take? So that's alright. Gradually. Your questions are nice, but don't take the answers all in a day. That will be not good. If you understand very easily, then you will forget very easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That is natural. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Natural, you see. If you understand little with difficulty, then you will forget also with difficulty. This is the way. So any other question? After this question-answer? (end)</div>
