<div class="Heading">Room Conversation with <span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span>Mahārāja<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>March 17, 1973, Māyāpur</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold">: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna. So, our Swami </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold"> has done a miracle! (Laughingly) He has done a miracle. What Bhaktivinoda conceived and [Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati] Prabhupada tried according to his conception to translate into action we find that through Swami </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold"> in his last days these revelations have been fulfilled. We are happy, we are glad, we are proud of Swami </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold">, and of you all too. When any person comes to take diksa and stay at the Math, we say that after wandering for a long time in a foreign land he is again coming back to his home. Home means homeward, back to God "back to home, back to Godhead." Back to Godhead means back to home, sweet, sweet home. Our home and life is there and nowhere else. So we may be quite free there of any misgivings or misconduct with such bold and clear faith we can go on, onward and onward. Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna. <i class="calibre3">V</i></span>āñchā-kalpatarubhyaś ca kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca....</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: Jaya o</span>ṁ viṣṇupāda paramahaṁsa parivrājakācārya<span class="Bold">....So we are thinking we are very much fortunate to hear His Divine Grace O</span>ṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya<span class="Bold"> Bhakti Raksaka Śrīdhara </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold">. He is, by age and experience, in both ways he is senior to me. I am also always fortunate to have his association for a very long timeperhaps since nineteen hundred and thirty or something like that. At that time, he did not accept </span><span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span><span class="Bold">; he just left home, vanaprastha. In his white dress he went to Allahabad. (Aside, to Śrīdhara </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold">:) </span>Mahārāja<span class="Bold">, I think you remember this incident when you went to Allahabad.</span></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Yes, I do.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, thank you. Yes, at that time...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: We took <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i> on the roof.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, thank you (devotees laugh). Yes. In that auspicious occasion we are connected. Before that, in 1920, ah 22, when I was manager in Dr. Bose's laboratory, young man, and I was nationalist, Congress party. I was a devotee of Mahatma Gandhi and C.R. Dāsa. At that time...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: When I was (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: That was the beginning of our...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I was in connection with Congress (?) in 1917.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Seventeen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, 17, when Anivesan (?) became the Congress president, yes. Then I became serious in 1920, and I gave up my education. So one of my friends, that friend he is also now, perhaps you know Mahārāja, that Naren Mullik?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was my intimate friend. So in their house, old Tīrtha Mahārāja went to beg some alms-they are very rich man. So, he informed me that "One nice <i class="calibre3">sannyāsī</i> came to our house,'' and he was invited, "in Ultadanga there is Gauḍīya Maṭha, so he has invited me. I wish to go there. Why don't you come? Let us go together." He was my very intimate friend. So at that time I was a little pessimistic (?), "I know all these <i class="calibre3">sādhus</i> there, I am not going.'' So he forced me, "Oh, why not come? Let us go.'' "All right, let us go." So I went to see His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura in 1922 in that Ultadanga building, and that time Prabhupāda was sitting on the roof. There was small house (indistinct) room, and we were welcome, because they thought Naren Mullik was very rich man and he has contributed some money. So, we went to see Prabhupāda, offered our obeisances. So immediately he said that "You are all educated young men, why don't you preach Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's message throughout the whole world?'' So I replied him, "Sir, we are dependent nation, who will hear our message? We can talk all these things after we get independence,'' because I was politically-minded at that time. So he refuted my argument. Certainly I was defeated, and I took his words very seriously, I appreciated. Then we were offered some <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i>, we came down, and my friend Naren Mullik asked me, "How did you like this <i class="calibre3">sādhu?</i>'' "Yes, here is a <i class="calibre3">sādhu</i> in whose hands Caitanya Mahāprabhu's message is there, and it will be done. I think this is very nice.'' That was my appreciation. Then 1923, I resigned my post as manager in Bose's laboratory, and I accepted the agency of whole U.P., beginning from Mughalsarai (?) up to Delhi, and I made my head office in Allahabad. So I was always thinking, "Oh yes, I met a very nice <i class="calibre3">sādhu.</i>'' From the very beginning, that was my impression, that "I have met a real <i class="calibre3">sādhu.</i>" So, actually the words, <i class="calibre3">lava mātra sādhu saṅge sarva siddhi haya<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Cc. Madhya 22.54], was actually... I perceived a kind (?) for a moment, and he impressed so much, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, that it was, it continued. Then in 1928, when there was Kumbha-melā... Mahārāja, when you joined Gauḍīya Maṭha?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Twenty-seven.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-seven. That means...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (in background, indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So 1928 there was a Kumbha-melā, I think. And during that Kumbha-melā, Tīrtha Mahārāja with a party came to my shop, Prayāg pharmacy, all of a sudden, and I thought, "Oh, these are the people I saw, Gauḍīya Maṭha. Yes.'' So, I was so glad. So Tīrtha Mahārāja asked me that "We are come new here. We are going to establish a temple in Allahabad. We have heard your name, so we have come to you. Please help us.'' "Yes, I will help you.'' So in this way I contributed, my attending physician contributed, and some other friends. In this way we became friends, and Tīrtha Mahārāja, old Tīrtha Mahārāja had first meeting in my house at Allahabad, with I think the Sarvesva (?) brahmacārī and Dhīra Kṛṣṇa brahmacārī...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct) Mahārāja and (indistinct) Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. So, my father was Vaiṣṇava, but when I invited these Gauḍīya Maṭha <i class="calibre3">sādhus</i>, my father thought that I have invited some <i class="calibre3">sādhus</i> of the Ramakrishna Mission. So he was not very interested. When Tīrtha Mahārāja is speaking, I call my... My father was that time invalid, I called him that "Please come down, there is a meeting of the Gauḍīya Maṭha <i class="calibre3">sādhus.</i>'' So, he could not resist my request, he came down, but he did not think that some devotees have come. They thought, these Ramakrishna Mission rascals have come. (laughter) So he was not very happy, but I told, he was sitting. He, so the meeting he just criticized. Then when he heard the speech of our old Tīrtha Mahārāja, our old Godbrother, he understood, "Oh, they are Vaiṣṇavas.'' Then immediately after the meeting, he came down on his feet. "I misunderstood you sir, that you are the Ramakrishna Mission <i class="calibre3">sādhu</i>. I am so glad to meet you. So that is the beginning of my intimate relationship with Gauḍīya Maṭha. And they are coming, and whenever somebody would come, I would invite them to lecture in my house. In that way Śrīdhara Mahārāja, at that time Ravendra-sundara (?) Bhaṭṭācārya, he was also invited at my house, and before (indistinct)... No, I think I invited Bhāratī Mahārāja, and you were with Bhāratī Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So in this way my connection became developed with Gauḍīya Maṭha. Then, gradually the process began, <i class="calibre3">hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ</i>. (chuckles) I wanted to become very big businessman and there was good opportunity. I was very nicely associated with the chemical industry of India. Dr. Bose's laboratory, Bengal Chemical, V.K. Farr (?), and all of them, they liked my business organization. Then I started big laboratory in Lucknow. So that was golden days, but gradually everything becomes (indistinct). And at last, my Allahabad business was lost. It was not lost on account of some, my debts, I had to hand it over to Dr. Kartik Chandra Bose because I was his agent. So I had some debts, so I tell the, "All right, you take this business.'' In this way, that Prayāg Pharmacy was lost. So I was not going to, I was sitting at home, but this Jaya Raghava (?) Mahārāja, at that time Sarvesva (?) brahmacārī and Atulananda brahmacārī, they used to come to take their subscription, and they were requesting that "Why don't you come to our <i class="calibre3">maṭha?</i> Why don't you come to our <i class="calibre3">maṭha?</i> You are now free.'' So, I used to visit their temple. That was not far away from my house...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: In Mahratta (?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mahratta (?), yes. Then the intimate relationship with Gauḍīya Maṭha grew. In this way, I think in 1933, yes, the Sir Malcolm Haley came to lay down the foundation stone of Allahabad Maṭha. Mahārāja, I think you remember, yes?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Yes, we were coming from Vṛndāvana <i class="calibre3">parikrama.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <i class="calibre3">parikrama</i>. And the <i class="calibre3">parikrama</i>, that is also another incident that... I, I was not initiated at that time, but I had very good admiration for these Gauḍīya Maṭha people, and before, before 1933 I met Śrīdhara Mahārāja and other devotees, old Tīrtha Mahārāja. So they were kind to me. Now, the <i class="calibre3">parikrama</i>, I thought, "What these people are doing in this <i class="calibre3">parikrama?</i> Let me go.'' So I met them in Kosi. Parvata Mahārāja, you may remember, and all people were going to see some Sesasayi.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so at that time Vinode Bhai, later on Keśava Mahārāja, he informed that "Prabhupāda is going to Mathurā tomorrow morning and he will speak Hari-kathā this evening. Anyone who wants to remain may remain or otherwise they may prepare to go to see Śeṣaśāyī." So at that time, I think only ten or twelve men remained. Out of them Śrīdhara Mahārāja was one of them, and I thought it wise, "What shall I see, this Śeṣaśāyī? Let me hear. Prabhupāda will speak, let me hear." So Prabhupāda marked that this boy...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct) to listen to him (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He, because he's a <i class="calibre3">vaikuṇṭha</i> person who could understand that this boy is eager to hear, so he very much appreciated. So when we came back to Allahabad, so Ganeśa Babu, he introduced me, that "Here is a nice devotee.'' So Prabhupāda immediately replied, "Yes, I have marked him. He does not go away, he hears.'' This (indistinct), "Yes, I will accept him as disciple.'' Then I was initiated. In this way our relationship with Gauḍīya Maṭha developed, and gradually as it developed, the other side diminished. Then, there are long history, it will take time, but I had the opportunity of associating with His Holiness. For several years I had the opportunity. Kṛṣṇa and Prabhupāda liked it to prepare me. Śrīdhara Mahārāja lived as a...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) ...in my house, some may say, a few years, so naturally we had very intimate talks and he was my good adviser. I took his advice, his instruction very seriously, because from the very beginning I know he's a pure Vaiṣṇava and devotee, and I wanted to associate with him, and try to help him also in so many ways. He also tried to help me, so our relationship is very intimate. After the breakdown of the Gauḍīya Maṭha, I wanted to organize another organization, making Śrīdhara Mahārāja head. And I wanted to mix... At that time Gosvāmī Mahārāja, one of my friend's house at Sealdah... Śrīdhara Mahārāja, you may remember those things. I wanted to organize in so many ways, but somehow or other...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: I had one house in Station Road belonging to Naren Mullik. (indistinct) very small (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, he wanted to rent us only for ninety rupees. I told him, "You just give me the concession. He, at that time he was getting 125, but because I am his friend, "All right, I'll give you, ninety rupees.'' So that could not happen somehow or other. So I was trying from the very beginning after the disappearance of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: First appearance of <i class="calibre3">Back to Godhead</i> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, 1944. I think you were at that time at my house. Yes. So, somehow or other, this intention for preaching the cult of Caitanya Mahāprabhu increased and the other side decreased. <i class="calibre3">Viraktir anyatra syāt</i>. But I was not disinclined, but Kṛṣṇa forced me that you must give up. (chuckles) And these thing is known better to Śrīdhara Mahārāja, how it decreased, decreased, decreased, then almost it become nil, and then I left home in 1950. Whatever was there, "All right, you do whatever you like.'' In 1954, four years I remained as <i class="calibre3">vānaprastha</i>, (indistinct) four years, from 1950 to 1959.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: In the mean time, Bombay. Bombay light.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bombay light, yes. Bombay light, that is during my householder life. I opened an office in Bombay for my business and... The (indistinct) Gauḍīya Maṭha was established by us. I am one of them. Śrīdhara Mahārāja also. And we made two parties for begging, collecting alms. Śrīdhara Mahārāja, myself and Gosvāmī Mahārāja. That time he was Atula, Atulacandra Gosvāmī. So I took them to some of my friends, chemist friends, doctors friends. So I collected about five hundred rupees to this. Śrīdhara Mahārāja would speak, I introduced, and Gosvāmī, at that time Gosvāmī Mahārāja would canvass (laughter). In this way three combined together, in one day or two days we... At that time five hundred rupees was (laughing) big amount.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Big sum.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big sum, yes. So Gosvāmī Mahārāja very much appreciated, and he began to speak highly about me that "Abhay Babu is so expert, he has got so many friends, he has collected so many... So why does he... He should be the Maṭha in-charge." In this way. "Why should he not live with us? Why he's living separately?'' In this way. So Prabhupāda, Mahārāja, Śrīdhara may remember it (laughing), he said, ''It is better to live separately from you people, and he will do the necessity in due course of time." So I could not understand what Śrīla Prabhupāda meant by that. So his inclination, blessings, were always upon me although (indistinct), but he was so kind.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct) collecting sufficient funds to come back (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was afraid.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: He asked you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prabhupāda gave me some money, that he is afraid, "You keep this money. When they need you can...'' So, by guru Vaiṣṇava, and whatever position I have got it is by guru's mercy and the Vaiṣṇavas' blessings, otherwise I am insignificant. So I wish that Śrīdhara Mahārāja may bestow his blessings as he was doing always, and my Guru Mahārāja may help me. I can give some service (?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I thought that (indistinct) Guru Mahārāja wanted and these Gauḍīya Math people did not do anything, so let me try in this old age. The inspiration came, and I went. By his grace it has become little successful, that's all. I have no credit. It is all the blessings of guru and Vaiṣṇava, that's all. I have no credit. I do not know how things are happening, because I am not at all bona fide position. But it is truly <i class="calibre3">chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: Are you going (indistinct) kindly talk with your men (?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: That will be (indistinct) to us, the land of gold and Golden Avatara (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am always (indistinct) to this, my American disciples that you are so much, I mean to say, taken care by God (?), this is... Your position is very good. Now you take to Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, and you become a perfect nation. That I preach always. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, you have got everything. All material opulence. Now make it plus Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be very nice. Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. So, these boys are trying, very sincerely and seriously, and I hope, even I do not live many more years, they will carry out this order.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara </span><b class="calibre4">Mahārāja<span class="Bold"></span></b>: (indistinct) coming down (indistinct) should be (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And our (indistinct) Mahārāja...</div>
