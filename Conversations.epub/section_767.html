<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol. Haribol. Haribol. Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] How do you like this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At Victoria...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere, as we are walking, the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> [break] ...tiresome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Walking and chanting, sometimes it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Little bit. It's a good.... A good place to do it is that Victoria Memorial because there's so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...people there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...places better than this place, then you shall go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. [break] Madhudviṣa will be there in the morning. He leads the <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's very lively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] ...twenty years, they've never swept the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Something like that. "Are sweeping the street." But only a few thousand of that are actually doing it. There's a big scandal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dishonest. They are producing only dishonest men. [break] ...get a boat like this? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Not a dinghy. This is bigger than.... The dinghy is not suitable for rough water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How big is your boat? As big as that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Forty feet. [break] ...boats in the back about two-thirds that size.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Those two big wooden boats back there? About two-third that size but not the same exact shape. Those are also big dinghies. [break] ...sagara, Midnapur, Diamond Harbor, that area, where...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those places are good places for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I went there when I bought the boat. People there are so hungry, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Angry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Hungry. Hungry. They're very.... I was eating a banana, I threw the peel on the ground and a boy picked up and ate the peel. I saw. They are so hungry. If we went there and distributed <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> so many people would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Enthusiastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that Consulate General, he has promised to help for getting grains from India, er, from America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He's given me the law, numbers, and he said that it's much higher than he is, but he'll give a recommendation if it comes to him. Apart from that, he told me how it's done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you take it very seriously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Well, he just told me last week. I heard you were coming, so.... The thing has to be done from Washington, D.C.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our men can do it. You advise them to do the needful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] Caitanya Maṭha's devotees are from Midnapur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. And Diamond Harbor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> And most of Mādhava Mahārāja's are from Assam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> All Assam, the <span class="Italic">pūjārī,</span> everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have Assamese?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> All Assam, <span class="Italic">pūjārī,</span> everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like Nepal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> No, they're a little bit stronger...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...nese considered to be Aryans? I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are Mongolians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was saying that to Jayapatāka, that they're Mongolians. So the same criticism that everyone has said against you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That you are making <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas brāhmaṇas.</span> I think that that Mongoloid race is also considered like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow what you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, my point is that they're always feeling that you are creating <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> amongst such low-class persons. So I see that they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I am creating <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> how he is low class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we don't agree that he is low class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If he says we are creating <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then where is low class? From logical point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, from low class to high class, he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, everyone is Brahman. So from this conditioned life of non-Brahman, if we create Brahman, what is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Original position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Ah. [break] Manipuri.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Many Manipuri people are coming to Māyāpur now. Many. They wear a special type of uniform, the women, one pinkish dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For seeing our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> They are going everywhere. The Bengalis are going mainly to our temple. But they've come so far, they see everywhere, naturally. But also our temple without fail. [break] The Nabadwip Commissioner came and he was so impressed. Now he is thinking.... He is trying to.... He is a little bit greedy that so many things are going in Māyāpur. He is trying to think how he can include Māyāpur within Nabadwip municipality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> That he is failing to do, but he is thinking, anyway. He told me. So many taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Material conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Bribe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] We should return now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] ...from Vrndavana has composed some Sanskrit poems for Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which Śāstrījī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> That you preached to last year at the festival time. There were seven <span class="Italic">śāstrīs,</span> four of which came to Māyāpur, three of which blooped. One is still left. He is very eager to become initiated. He is very hard working and sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What does he do there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He is teaching Sanskrit to the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He is teaching the meter, how to chant them, to all the Western devotees and to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who's here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I never had time to go. Bhāvananda knows. [break] ...the Bengali language also. We have one copy at Māyāpur. If we have a festival here in Calcutta with a Bengali film, many people can appreciate it. Of course, English they also.... That first <span class="Italic">paṇḍāl,</span> we didn't have any movie then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Those first <span class="Italic">paṇḍāls</span> we never had a cinema.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Only <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> (end)</div>
