<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Trivikrama Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think he's rather keen on working in Southeast Asia still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He spoke to me this morning. He has to go back for some time to Southeast Asia, but he's willing to stay in India and travel between centers. He's a very nice <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and I think it would be a very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Call him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is giving a class right now, but he cannot go... He told me that he has to go to Southeast Asia first because he has books and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He has two men there still. There's two men there still, and they have about two and a half thousand books still to distribute. He said one of the reasons he wanted to come was cause there's no center... (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that a high-court judge and he does not know what is God. How misfortunate he is. And he's speaking of God, "Surrender," all theoretical. They do not know what is surrender. If I say anybody that "Go to Dr. Patel and surrender unto him, and whatever he'll prescribe, you take it," but if he does not know what is Dr. Patel, then where he'll go and what to surrender? This is their position. They speak big, big words but do not know where to go. It is not? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They do not believe in what you say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? That is the truth. Actually they do not know, and they cheat others, speaking about God. That is the difficulty. All rascals are doing that. And if I say, "All rascals," it is little harsh, but it has to be said. They do not know what is God, and they speak of God. Let them say frankly that "I do not know what is God." That is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> If they are sincere, then after many, many births... <span class="Italic">Kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta...</span> [Bg. 12.5]. They do not know, and they will not accept <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam.</span> The <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> says, Rāmānujācārya says, Madhvācārya says, big, big <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu... They will not believe them. They will speculate in their nonsense speculation. This is the difficulty. Without going to the <span class="Italic">ācārya...</span> <span class="Italic">Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the Vedic process, how one can know. But they will speculate. <span class="Italic">Ciraṁ vicinvan. Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvayaṁ jānāti tattvam... Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvayam, leśānugṛhīta eva hi jānāti tattvaṁ na cānya eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan</span> [SB 10.14.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has little mercy of God upon him, he can understand, but others, they can speculate for many, many births; still, they'll never be able. <span class="Italic">Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvayaṁ leśānugṛhīta jānāti tattvam. Leśānugṛhīta eva hi. Leśa.</span> One cannot know God full. That is not possible because you are limited; He is unlimited. Still, if one has learned, at least if one has accepted, "Here is God, Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bas,</span>" his knowledge is perfect. If he simply believes only that "Here is God," he can understand. They don't believe that Kṛṣṇa is God. "Eh... He may be very powerful...," so on. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> These rascals will not believe. "So what is there for me?" <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti.</span> If they remain persistently <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> who can make them understand? Very difficult. (Hindi) Gandhi did not believe in Kṛṣṇa. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't know that. I think he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should know. You have read Gandhi's book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He practiced Vaiṣṇavism. That is what my wife said. Always, daily, to worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not... I do not know what is Gandhi's book, his <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> lecture. Why don't you purchase them? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll get you some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He mentioned that, that "My Kṛṣṇa is different imagination. My imagination of Kṛṣṇa is different." That is his position. He imagines. He has... (Hindi) "My imagination of Kṛṣṇa..." This is... How he can believe Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is preaching violence, and he's trying to draw nonviolence. The people will challenge, but he makes his own commentation, his own imagination. He said, "My imagination of Kṛṣṇa is different." This is his word. And actually... He is the student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and in his <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> there is not a single picture of Kṛṣṇa. He does not believe in Kṛṣṇa. But believe or not believe, he was reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> had respect. That will give him some profit, there is no doubt. [break] <span class="Italic">Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> Everything is clearly said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I speak, therefore, to my disciples that "You simply repeat like parrot <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and follow by your life. Don't try to become very big scholar, do interpretation. Remain foolish and believe in Kṛṣṇa. Then life is perfect." And actually that is happening. They never tried to eschew and... What is called, the English word? Draw out some meaning. Eschew or something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Eschew is the right word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do, everyone. The Tilak has done like that, Gandhi has done like that, Vinod Bhave is doing that. Dr. Radhakrishna has done like that, Vivekananda has done, Aurobindo has done-everyone. Nobody would take directly, that "Here is God." What do you think? They have taken directly? Do they believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, believe in God, that is everyone doing. So what is their special credit? Why do they touch <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and say, "My imagination of God is different"? How cheating it is. If your imagination of God is different, why do you touch <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and declare yourself that "I am a student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> My life is also for <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even when Tilak... Tilak says he follows <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone says that. But nobody says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A part of it, not the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody says that "Here is God, Kṛṣṇa." That is their fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can bring the car down at ten o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody says, "Here is God." That is, perhaps... We Vaiṣṇavas say; I am preaching. Perhaps I am the first preacher to the world, that "Here is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Some of these great Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> were doing interpretation of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The who is <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> except the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācārya</span>? All loafer class. All loafer class. They're not <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Except these Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> who is <span class="Italic">ācārya</span>? They're not <span class="Italic">ācāryas. Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān</span> [SB 11.17.27]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I read your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and after that, I read Rāmānuja's. They more or less the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same thing. There is no difference between the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Then how he becomes <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> if there is difference of opinion? They cannot be <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> (end)</div>
