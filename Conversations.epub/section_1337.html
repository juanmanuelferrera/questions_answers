<div class="Normal-Level">(long Hindi conversation with Kavirāja)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well it's hard to... I could not follow everything because it was in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He talks a lot. Of course Marwaris always talk a lot. He's a Marwari so they always talk like that. We'll have to see how his medicine works Śrīla Prabhupāda. There's no way to tell. We are always getting fooled. The first impression simply by seeing is very difficult in this age, I would rather...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the last we have tried. So let us follow him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh yeah, definitely we should try his medicines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Adri?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what is that? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You give him some hint. He was going to talk and you stopped him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Going to what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (to Adri-dharaṇa:) Does he have a big practice in Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Yes, very big practice. He is known for his quality, mixing of drugs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span> Big practice in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> On the plane he met another doctor and he chastised him for making diluted drugs. So it seems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Adri-dharaṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says that on the plane he met another doctor so he chastised that other doctor for making diluted drugs. He's known for his upstanding qualities in the mixing of drugs purely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Everything he makes, he claims that he makes by the hand. And he's also recommended by another Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">āyur-veda.</span> Actually we had gone to see him there and he said to approach this man. He said this is the best man in the field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who is the other man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> That man, Govardhanaji, he is on (indistinct) street, and he was recommended by L. N. Bangor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who, the other one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But he would not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> No, he said that "You need the best man for this," and he said, he recommended him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That other one, Govardhanaji, he was a Rāmānuja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Also Rāmānuja, but not so staunch as this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> L. N. Bangor recommended another one but that other one, when Adri-dharaṇa went there, the other one recommended this one saying this one is better. And Adri-dharaṇa said this one is more staunch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> And when I came he was very, he had many good Vaiṣṇava qualities. Immediately he said, "This is for Guruji, for a devotees. I am not take anything, I'll do all my services free."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a good quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Actually when he flies and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long... (?) This is a last resort. Whatever it may be. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of course, we don't mind going on looking one after another for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh. No more, no more trial. Adri-dharaṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> About this man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Follow strictly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you agree that we should follow strictly his advice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> From my experience I think he's a very good man. He's a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We certainly have... We might as well try. We've tried everyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So let us try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He did agree with your own diagnosis, Prabhupāda. He said <span class="Italic">makaradhvaja</span> at this point would be poison and today you said that it was poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> So that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Mm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Satadhanya asks whether he looks like the man you saw in the dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has <span class="Italic">tilaka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he has nice <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct). The other man, he has nice <span class="Italic">tilaka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Govardhanaji has <span class="Italic">tilaka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Also Govardhanaji was not very, extremely helpful. He said he would not come to Vṛndāvana. He said he would not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now this man said in fifteen days Prabhupāda would be better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> He said there will be improvement, in a few days, two or three days there will be improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he's staying for two or three days at least? Or is he going to stay one day and leave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> So he is not... His mind is not made up. I'll have to talk to him and ask him to stay longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let him first of all prescribe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But he should stay to see what the effect of the medicine is. Supposing he prescribes and it has a reverse reaction, then if he's gone how will he see anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever chart he has made, he'll follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we can follow but if it has a bad reaction, you'll want to change it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We can't say that we'll follow blindly. If something is given and it doesn't work properly, you'll want to have it adjusted. Better if he stays here for some time with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> At least some days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least for a few days he should stay here and see how the medicine is working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, first of all let him make chart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, of course. No, that's right. First he should make prescription and then we'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Adri, you should go with him. You are staying in that room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> Yes, I'm staying with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why don't you go? I told him to go, be with the Kavirāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's staying in the same room with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They gave him the governor's room, that number thirty-one, the big room. Śrīla Prabhupāda, may I talk to you about Vrindavan Candra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I had a little talk with him, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 'Cause you're giving him about, he gets about 800 rupees a month from the BBT for travel expenses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I have some experience with myself as organizing books distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So when we would spend with our Rādhā-Dāmodara party, we used to spend about five thousand dollars a month for travel expenses, but for that five thousand dollars we would make a hundred thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words twenty times whatever we spent on travelling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if he does not give substantial order then stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he's not giving any order. I mean the point I made to him was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I told him, "Vrindavan, you're netting 800 rupees so for that 800 rupees you must be booking ten to twenty thousand rupees worth of orders."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if he's not giving, then stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I said to him if you're getting ten to twenty thousand, either, two things are happening, either you're not getting the orders, then what is the use of spending 800 rupees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or the other thing is that you're getting the orders but you're not giving any money to the BBT.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then be satisfied with stipends, two hundred, three hundred, live in that house and then like that nothing wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have no objection to paying him if he was doing business but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I just see he's not doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I fully depend on your discrimination. I, if he's not giving bill then just stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I told him that if you do business, you take the 800 rupees but doing business means you'll pay the BBT some bills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If you're not paying any bills it means you're not doing business. He is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very carefully the... I want they may not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Squander.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...suffer for want of stipend and place. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do like that and I fully depend on you. If he's not giving business what is the use of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is spen... I think he's just taking the money and using it for some other business. He can't be spending 800 rupees and not doing any business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And if he's spending the 800 for travelling and not booking order then what is the use of spending the 800 rupees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Tell him frankly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then stop everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I told him. I said, "You think about it tonight and tomorrow we'll talk again."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Hm. Do everything very cautiously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not that out of affection we shall squander money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So use your best intelligence and if he has not given then stop everything, let them have 250 per month per head and live in that house. That's all. This is my final.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two hundred fifty plus we have to fix seven hundred fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For seven years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seven years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not a single paisa more than two hundred fifty. Only my wife may get five hundred, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She's getting a thousand actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (pause) So take his chart and try to follow. This is the last resort. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. Well, don't say it is the last. We're not going to ever going to give up hope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. He appears to be hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He seems very hopeful, his attitude appeared hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They all say that your heart is very strong, therefore what is the question of dying? They all say that point. Their whole contention is on the heart, that because the heart is strong, they say there's no question of dying. And actually that agrees with the astrologers. None of the astrologers say you will die now. They all say it's a difficult time but they never say that you will die now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They all say that you'll overcome this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And your disciples all say that you will overcome. <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Heart is strong then where is the question of tuberculosis? (laughs) Wrong present (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody said tuberculosis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, that was that allopathic Dr. Gopal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> He was guessing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> He was just guessing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was guessing but he gave the recommendation for a strong anti-tubercular medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, therefore I am not going to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, these allopathic doctors have been totally a failure for you. There's no question of going back to them in any case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has already concluded something and he wants to prove it by x-ray and this and that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And strong medicine he prescribed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He would have created havoc with his testing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not going to die, I will remain in his treatment, this <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> The doctors, they create a situation and they have preconceived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, they make you, if you don't have the disease, then they'll make sure you get it, simply to be right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I shall remain in his treatment. Good (indistinct), that's all. Take his chart and strictly follow. I'll not object, I will follow. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whatever you tell us is all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. And from Vrindavan, if he's not getting business stop all, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's not getting business. He told me he's having bad luck, he cannot get a new business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, so if he has to do business, he has to pay cash and he'll give fifty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If he was getting the business, he would have paid your BBT some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In over a year he has paid two or three thousand rupees. That's not business. He's taking 800 rupees a month for so long for travel expenses, and he's paid maybe two or three thousand rupees total. I mean it's crazy business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anybody can see it's not good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So stop it all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I talked with him in a nice way though. I said, "Now you tell me, Vrindavan." I gave him the points. I said, "So you think about it tonight and you let me know tomorrow." I'm talking in a nice way with him because I feel that in... I want them to be happy. I can see they're not so intelligent so they should not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least five thousand rupees business must be given otherwise... That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Immediately there should be business. If a man spends nearly a thousand rupees for travelling every month, he must be making fifteen, twenty thousand rupees. But he is not giving any money at all to the BBT.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...request him that "Since you feel that it is very important that Prabhupāda get a little more strength, you kindly wait about two more days, and let us go like that." In other words, we're not overly eager to leave tomorrow. If the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> were willing to stay here for ten days more, we'd be very happy, and then after ten days we'd go with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So let us try and in some way induce him to extend, as far as he can, and then we'll go on whatever day he says he must go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Actually he agreed to stay about three, four more days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Huh. If he agrees to stay a couple more days, we should take advantage of that to give you more time to gain strength. Not that we're overly eager to rush out of here. Our plan is that we want to go where he is, that we want you to remain under his treatment. That is our point. If he was willing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if after all he wants to go, why not leave earlier?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because the whole idea of going is that the medicine is supposed to be having effect. So the longer we have for the medicine to take effect, the stronger you should become. And the stronger you become, the easier will be the journey. It would only be a question of one or two days extra, because in any case he'll want to leave after a few days. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...some rest, backside, I can sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> With some rest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Something to rest against on his back. Then he can sit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, and in any case we were going to purchase three seats for Your Divine Grace so that you can lie down conveniently in the plane also. No harm in taking... Because one thing you have to remember: the entire journey will take ten hours, so you should conserve your strength by laying down as far as possible. Here you can sit up for two hours because the bed is stationary, and then you can always be resting. But this will be a ten-hour journey. So we should try to take every possible means to allow you to be comfortable the whole way and to relax as much as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give me some rest, backside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pillows. There's a couple in that room, also in the palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Just setting it up, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We just have to move your back. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Śrīla Prabhupāda seems to be feeling a little bit of benefit already from the treatment. (Bhakti-caru translates to <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>) So he's... He feels a little confident under your care. So he's feeling that whenever you like to go to Calcutta, as you have other important business there, that you take him with you and we'll all come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The thing is that Prabhupāda does not, neither we feel confident at all, to have Prabhupāda treated by anyone else even in the interim period. (Bhakti-caru translates, <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> answers) The problem is that if some assistant is here, if in case there's some problem develops, then the assistant has to become the one who gives a diagnosis, and we don't trust any assistant. (Bhakti-caru translates, <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> answers)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying that the main disease is being taken care of, but there might be some secondary ailments like a cough or passing stool. Someone has to take care of these sort of symptoms, the secondary effects. But the main thing he has given the medicine, and that he's going to give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the fact is that no matter how expert one may be, sometimes the body reacts in a certain way. Sometimes the body may react in a way which was not foreseen. And then we are at the mercy of this assistant. And that we do not want. This assistant is... We are not very anxious about it. No person of any great position would ever place themselves under an assistant like that, never. If Morarji Desai was to be treated, he would never allow that assistant to touch him. (Bhakti-caru translates) We prefer to take the risk... (<span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> interrupts) You can explain this point. We prefer to take the risk of traveling than the risk of being treated by that assistant, because if you are personally present, there's less risk. (Bhakti-caru translates) Here's what it will entail. From here we will go in the car, a very good, big Western car with a mattress in the back seat, and Prabhupāda will be laying down. You can explain that. (Bhakti-caru translates) Then we'll have a wheelchair at the airport. The car will go right up to the plane and the wheelchair... We'll carry Prabhupāda right into a seat, and he can lay down in the three seats. Then again we'll take him off the plane. Immediately he'll lay down in the car and go to Māyāpura. (Bhakti-caru translates) There there's open air. Here we have to keep everything closed. Cold draft is coming here. And also there all the vegetables are grown fresh on our land. Plus change of place is also nice for improved health. Prabhupāda is accustomed every three days to go to another country or another city. (Bhakti-caru translates, <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> answers) We will have about ten of us. There will be at least ten of us traveling, so we will give him all... (Bhakti-caru translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He said Prabhupāda cannot sit. He'll give a medicine for heart so that if there is any jerking or things, it won't effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore we want him to take Prabhupāda. (Bhakti-caru translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He says in this condition he can even take Prabhupāda to London. He was thinking that due to the climatic condition here he could have improved better, because it's a dry climate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where? Here? As opposed to... The climate in Māyāpura is damp now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Bengal is little damp as compared to North India, UP.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These days here. But unfortunately you cannot stay here. (Bhakti-caru translates, <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> answers)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> I was telling him that... I mean, he's facing great difficulty preparing the medicines also here. He says that it's been done; dose of medicine for twenty days has been prepared. Like today also he has got to go for six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The main point is that we would very much be glad if he is able to periodically, every day or every other day, whatever the requirement, to check up on Prabhupāda. What we are afraid is that for twenty days he will not be present to check up. This other man is not competent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, he didn't say it in that relation also. I told him that medicine is a big problem. (Bengali) He says during the last three days there has been only development.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> Progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Only progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We haven't seen anything regressive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And Prabhupāda is taking rest also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It appears hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He could have been cured in ten days here, but there it will take twenty days to a month due to the climatic condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says that due to climatic condition, what would take ten days to cure here will take twenty days to thirty days in Māyāpura. The climate is not... (<span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span>-Hindi) But the real issue is this. The real issue is that although we were sitting here in the best climate, Prabhupāda was getting worse until he came. So the real point is not the climate but the doctor. (Bhakti-caru translates-<span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> Hindi-laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you (Hindi) arrange tomorrow?</div>

We leave the day after tomorrow morning? Okay. So we'll arrange the seats. You want to show that urine color? You have some sample you kept?</div>

We gave him very nice <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and showed him the movie "Hare Kṛṣṇa People." And on the 25th of November, that's Rāsa-pūrṇimā festival, and that is big day at Māyāpura. In three days probably over half million people will come to the temple. We sell so many books, magazines. It never used to be like that, Śrīla Prabhupāda, until you built this center.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they can go to the temple now, this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let us go to the temple? You want to go to the temple now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Myself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean the devotees here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want them to go into the temple and perform <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. And you'll hear it from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right. Temple without <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> doesn't have full life. Bhavānanda Mahārāja was just saying that this evening. The <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party from Māyāpura, they went back today. Otherwise, every night they've been doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> for about five hours. Today they're not here because they're returning to Māyāpura. I was thinking today how you've always taken care of us so much and served us so much all of these years that now Kṛṣṇa is giving us a small little opportunity to just do a little service to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many men, they have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard that somewhere between a hundred and 150. They reserved all of the rooms of the guesthouse. I told Bhakti-prema Swami to speak there on the subject of Fifteenth Chapter, fifteenth verse,</div>
<div class="Verse">sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca<br class="calibre2"/>vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo<br class="calibre2"/>vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 15.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are looking after the book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are they looking after the book table?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll have to find out from Viśāla how his book sales are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundred fifty men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I've been told between a hundred and a hundred-fifty. There's a lecture in the temple now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> can't be done in the temple just now because there's a lecture there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lecture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Every evening there's lecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> lecture every evening in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So I'll inform the organizer that when Rāma-Kṛṣṇajī and Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa come, to inform them that they can come and see you. (end)</div>
