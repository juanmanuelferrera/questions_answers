<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...the bullock cart to Vṛndāvana. You were thinking to travel again, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some pain? Oh, here he is. Here's Lokanātha, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lokanātha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are coming back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, we came back from <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> We had <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> in the town, Vṛndāvana, Loi Bazaar and Banke Bihārī temple, that route. We had a bullock cart filled in with Gurukula school children, and there was a big group of devotees chanting and dancing in front of the cart, and there was also van, making announcement, inviting people for our afternoon program of <span class="Italic">ārati, kīrtana,</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> No, we already did. I announced, and we also had <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> It was very ecstatic. Thirty, forty devotees came, and it was very, very nice. Wherever we stopped, people gathered around us in a big number, enjoyed <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and heard announcements about the program. So I just came back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> will be served out to the guests after this <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> Twelve o'clock is <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> And then we'll be serving out <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> to the guests first. When everyone is served, we'll eat the remnants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The devotees aren't going to take the feast also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, remnants of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, the remnants of the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Now, 11:35.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got all in your charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Consult with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Make up a tour? All right. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Since a long time I have got a desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Prabhupāda's had this ambition for a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Travel in the holy places. So you'll be doing in...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we can discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Lord Balarāma, He did that. He went to all the holy places. So in the same way, if you can get a little strength from Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma here in Vṛndāvana, then you can... Lord Balarāma was going to all the different places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I give you idea. Where is Lokanātha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, I'm here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is called? Front party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of party?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Front party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Front party, advance party, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll give us description of the land, and before our going, they'll make a camp. Small, big, that doesn't matter. And in the morning, the former camp broken, and go to the next camp with <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> In the meantime the other camp is ready to receive you. Then the next camp, after taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> they'll go to the next camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you follow this, Lokanātha? Do you have a question to ask?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So there is a smaller group going in advance, and bigger group with you stays back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, and they go, fix the place, and inform your party where they are and what kind of arrangement they have made. And when you are satisfied, you leave that place to join the first group, small group, advance party. Right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And after Prabhupāda joins that group, then the advance party goes again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> To the next place, to make further arrangements at the next place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Ye. This kind of program we have done before also. Whenever we had big group traveling, we always send two devotees out, or sometimes four devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We also did that with our Rādhā-Dāmodara program. That is the way of traveling-advance booking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, so the main party does not lose time in finding or looking for the place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're not inconvenienced in any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Right. So that advance party could wait at the gate of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wherever. But that's the idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when you go in procession, have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes. That would be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Originally, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we talked of this idea, we were considering going with a few vehicles so that we could go to many holy places all over India. I still think that that's the best idea, and Lokanātha also agreed with me when we talked about this. Because bullock carts... Of course, we're not in a big rush, but if we would like to go to a few pla..., all over India, we can go very comfortably with a few vehicles. Prabhupāda can have the back seat of a vehicle, travel very comfortably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I could see this Volkswagen we have. They don't have any seats. It's all flat. They already have mattresses, and it's kind of a big room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like that. That's more convenient for traveling all over India, Prabhupāda. I mean we should be practical also. Otherwise we'll spend from one <span class="Italic">tīrtha</span> to another, just like from here... Supposing we wanted to go just like Ayodhyā. Oh, three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> More.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> More than three weeks, just to go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> It will take two and a half months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two and a half months, Śrīla Prabhupāda, just to go from one <span class="Italic">tīrtha-sthāna</span> to the next. We don't have that kind of time. Better that we go in very good caravan of vehicles, comfortable. You will have your own vehicle, the advance party will have one vehicle, and one or two others... Your party will have two or three vehicles, and the advance party can have one vehicle. We have enough cars. Your Divine Grace has a car in Māyāpura; we have a car here in Vṛndāvana; we have one of your cars in Bombay. There's so many vehicles and vans. So we have our choice. We can get very nice vehicles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That will make a very nice impression also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Otherwise... Svarūpa Dāmodara was mentioning to me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if we were to take you in a bullock cart... What did you say Svarūpa Dāmodara? People would accuse us of being very negligent of you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and it would look very bad upon our Society. They would accuse us, how we have taken our spiritual master...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They wouldn't understand these transcendental activities of the Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You've always preached that we should do things in a modern way, just appropriately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And use for Kṛṣṇa whatever available...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think if we fix up vehicles very nicely, that will be nice. Will that be all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> And most of the holy places are connected with good roads. During our preaching we also visit holy places. When they're on the way, we pass through them. And if we travel not very fast, with good drivers, it won't be much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhakti-caitanya Swami is the fit driver for your vehicles, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Is that all right? I know he would want to come. Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's expert, Bhakti-caitanya Swami. He knows how to arrange everything also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> These vehicles can supply electricity so that when you stop...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purchase at least four vehicles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Four what, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least four vehicles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Purchase at least four vehicles. Right. I think some scientist should also come with us, Śrīla Prabhupāda (laughter), in case we meet anyone very intelligent, we need a scientific mind to defeat them. So Svarūpa Dāmodara can come with us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> And someone to make members (laughter), in case we meet any rich people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Girirāja is requesting to come, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Is it all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By managing you can come, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. If you manage properly, then you can all come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So do I come with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will be the leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You're the leader of the party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So I have a vehicle. They also could travel with us, and in the same town they will do <span class="Italic">nagara-saṅkīrtana</span> all day long and distribute books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I think that it will make our program complete. We have membership team, we have scientist visiting the scientists, and our boys will go door to door, house to house, and spread your message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> With book distribution and <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I think that the Māyāpura book distribution team now has some heavy competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> With Prabhupāda's traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> and book distribution. Also our party is well equipped to do evening programs. So there will be lot of senior devotees, and advance party could arrange programs and do different big temples or different public meetings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you should not overexert yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can do the speaking and the <span class="Italic">kīrtanas.</span> Prabhupāda should be allowed to do simply <span class="Italic">tīrtha-yātrā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You'll be acting through us, by your mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda never does anything small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Prabhupāda is big. He thinks of big and he does big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But first get a little more strength, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That we really request you to do so that the program... Let us do it so that it becomes successful, not that after two days we have to turn back. When going we should not turn back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So let us become prepared properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (as they lift Prabhupāda?) You'll bruise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "You'll bruise," Prabhupāda said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already bruised enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is already rough and bruised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? We'll just lift your shoulders a slight bit so that we can pull the sheet out? Then it won't bruise. If I just lift you... Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda? (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or shall we discuss more? We can start discussing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. We'll have <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> here for you. Okay. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
