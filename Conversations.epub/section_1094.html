<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...free. Free education, why they'll not accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Free education they will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is free education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is free. We are asking people come here, live here, take this education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Nobody pays anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is free. Everything is free. We are not going to charge anything. Retired man, come here, take this spiritual education. This is our whole system. Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Why they'll not do? Just think over this. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have given this main point to our lawyers and this is what we are working on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is completely educational. Spiritual education. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> It is not religious sentiment. Some Arya-samajis told me in Durban, South Africa, that "Why you are bringing this Hindu idea?" And this is not your Hindu idea. Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.</span> Does it mean that only Hindus, from boyhood they become youth, and the Musselman does not? What is this nonsense? People are so misguided they cannot understand this simple word, this spiritual education. They say Hindu idea. That only the Hindu boys grow to become young men. The Muslim, the Christian, they do not grow up. Just see how much in darkness they are and how much they require this education. How the world is in need of this spiritual education. And they cannot understand it. Just see how they are dull and rascal headed. Hindus grow only. Huh? <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam... [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Kṛṣṇa said from boyhood to <span class="Italic">yauvanam,</span> it is Hindu idea. The Arya-samaji friend told me, why you bring this Hindu idea? How much dull they are just imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't think it is dullness. It is fanaticism maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who becomes fanatic? All rascals, dull. They become fanatic. Otherwise, why one should be fanatic? If one has got brain, one has got logic, how he should be fanatic? Fanatics means dullheaded rascal, that's all. The Muslims they become fanatic, we say, generally they are, because they're dullheaded. Always unclean and eating meat and low behavior. What is that? <span class="Italic">Pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ, na śaucaṁ nāpi cācāraḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is dull head.

No discrimination. (Hindi) Sex is a bodily, what is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Necessity of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Biological necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Necessity. What is the difference? Why not with sister, why not with daughter or even why not with mother? What is the wrong there? They say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They consider themselves to be animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are animals. Why consider? They are animals. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">viḍ-bhujām.</span> Not ordinary animals. A sewer animal. Sewer. (Hindi) Animal society. <span class="Italic">Dvipāda-paśu.</span> We'll say that "Why you are wasting your time in this so-called material advancement?" How they'll understand? So dull head. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) You're right. The modern civilization is the materialists, <span class="Italic">veda</span> is material. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is body consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means sewer civilization. It is sewer civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...is only the civilization of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> We have lost the Vedic mooring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why India should lost? India is the hope of the whole world and their men have now become sewer, sewer <span class="Italic">kavaca.</span> That is my regret. Others may be, but why Indians? Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,</div>

<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmi,</span> you don't become sewer dweller. You make your life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have become, sir, in a way, because we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you should check now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our system has been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should check now. You should revive now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Vedic civilization is the base of our making a man. I mean, truly a good man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, we should check it. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) (chants <span class="Italic">japa)</span> [break] Hindu idea. Hindu idea. [break] You know that? fetus? What is that? Killing and eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Somebody told. You or somebody. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not somebody. Everybody says. Not some. Everyone knows. It is common practice. Delicacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The idea is so abominable to our culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Sewers activity's all abominable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But this idea of eating a fetus is extremely abominable. You can't think of it. I mean a baby having developed, we can't imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you must know it. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...makes the way Western civilized people kill, we simply shudder at the very idea. Others, they're not able to, I mean, bear the sight of meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our men, those who are not educated, they are better than the... That people may call superstition, but if they are going by the old superstition they would have... I have seen in, sometimes in 1945 or '46, in a train one village girl was sitting and covering. She's young girl, going to her husband's house. What is that? <span class="Italic">Kane.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Gomath, gangath.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no. <span class="Italic">Kane.</span> After... Because formerly the girls were married early. So after getting puberty there is one ceremony, it is called <span class="Italic">diti-abhi-bha.(?)</span> Another ceremony. And then she goes to her husband's house. So she was going there with presentation of father, mother. So she was covered. So another young girl, up-to-date, she was doing like this. They were girls. One can touch another. So once, twice. When it made thrice, that village girl slapped her, "Hut!" I said, "Yes, you have done right." She was thinking, the city girl was thinking, "What is this nonsense?" She wanted to criticize... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> She got a slap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And she gave a good slap. I've seen it. She's up-to-date and she became surprised. Lifting the <span class="Italic">avaguṇṭhana.</span> So the whole train, they became laughed. And woman, the shyness is the only protection for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Shyness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Modesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Modesty. There is no modesty left. Anyway, and that is the beauty. But we are breaking that. There is no beauty, no attraction. And as soon as you break this modesty, shyness, then the woman will create devastation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. They have been. They have finished now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no carpet to sit down in front of... Oh, here it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, If you sit down, these swellings will become less on the feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, a little movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We got your examined. You haven't got much diabetes now. But unfortunately kidneys are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm not eating all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, after kidneys are little affected. It was lack of albumen and perhaps you'll be all right by this <span class="Italic">shapauri.(?)</span> You know this <span class="Italic">shapauri. Shapauri's</span> growing in our own garden here. That (indistinct) will be coming on first day at six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">satavari,(?)</span> you see. If it is medicine, we can have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He will guide you better than me. At six o'clock we have to send somebody to catch him on his consulting. He stays somewhere... His house number is 36.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If they let me know I can bring him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He has already given time, six o'clock. If you can go and bring him at six o'clock...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, then they will have to come from all the way here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. He will be coming here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) This is fact. The whole world has become sewer. (Hindi) Including India. It is not that India is now human being. No. India has also become sewer. So it is a great service. This is the only service to the human society. And to keep them sewer and organizing United Nations. What the sewer will unite?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> United Nation of sewers. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So how it will be successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is all they have. This is disunited nation, not united nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I said in some public meeting in Melbourne, "The United Nation is the assembly of some dogs. They are barking." And newspapermen added, "The Swami has come to hound you." (laughter) Eh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "His Divine Grace is here to hound us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hound. Yes. So I attacked the whole United Nations, and so they attacked me also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, we have seen the League of Nations was even better than the United Nations. They are all really fighting among themselves very badly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now how they cannot fight? They are swines and dogs. How they will remain peaceful? It is not possible. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless they are spiritually elevated they cannot be peaceful. It is impossible. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply by stamping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And there is another class of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gandhi became <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> but his mission was, "Get out, Englishmen, get out." Where is <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu?</span> He declared himself <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> but his business was how to drive away the Englishmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, he, I mean, I'm sorry to interrupt you. He never hated Englishmen. It's their method he wanted to drive out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not hate you, but I beat you with shoes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, you don't beat me with shoes. He never beat them the shoes. He said, "Well we don't like you." If I say, "Do this," and it is not good, I mean, I'm not wrong in that way I suppose. I'm open to correction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. English civilization is not good. What was the wrong? I say repeatedly again and again, he ruined the Manchester cloth business, he developed Ahmedabad cloth. The result is we poor men, we were paying one rupee six annas per pair, now we are paying thirty rupees. Money is going... Instead of going to the pocket of the Englishmen it is going to the pocket of Mahadevia. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> English people, they, I mean, ruined their whole industry of... Bengal textile industry was ruined by Britishers. They cut away the thumbs. That is... I'm sorry, sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore why <span class="Italic">mahātmā?</span> The same business you are doing, why you say <span class="Italic">mahātmā?</span> If you are doing the same business...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He never called himself <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> People called him <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He liked to enjoy it. He liked to enjoy it. That's all. <span class="Italic">Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">. Mahātmā</span> has no business to this... [break] ...fact, the present position of India, it is not very good. But we can do that. We have got the means. If we make propaganda village to village. Still, the villagers, they are unpolluted, they can be recovered. Still, when we hold meeting of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, thousands of men come. And that, our Hyderabad land is very suitable for this purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The thing is, Prabhupāda, in India they know that materialism is wrong because they've been educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But they are being educated that materialism is good, and this so-called spiritual... They do not recognize the spiritual movement. Our government do not recognize any spiritual movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They interpret secularism as no religion. Rather equal truth to all religions is the real meaning of secularism. The Government tries... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...world will be benefited. Still people observe India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If it is told by (indistinct) who accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why these boys are attracted ? They have not come here to see your industry for materialism. They have come here for spiritual. They have not come to see your cycle and sewing machine. Actually, they have come, Vṛndāvana, Māyāpura. And they are not poverty stricken. We go to Europe being poverty stricken. That Lady Wellington, he (she) challenged one of my Godbrothers, Bhakti Tīrtha Mahārāja, that "You Indian people..." She was very proud, Lady Wellington. Wellington was Iceland. She said that "You Indian people..." Of course, it was friendly talk. "You come to our country, we give you some stamp, degree, and you earn your livelihood in India. What you have come here to teach?" This was the challenge. Actually, that was happening. We were sending our men to England to become bar-at-law, to become MS, CP, to become this and that, and they became here big men. So why you people come here to teach us? This was the challenge. In those days a little favor of Englishman was considered a great boon. In Bengal there is a word, <span class="Italic">saheb śubha. Saheb</span> means European, especially Englishman, and <span class="Italic">śubha</span> means "auspicious." So if anyone can make friendship with a European, then his life is successful. And that was happening. The Englishmen were opening business houses. If somebody became connected, he gets good business. He becomes a rich man. There is a family in Calcutta, Saubhaga (?) Raj family. So the head of that family, Navinchandra Dev, he was a minor clerk of Lord Clive's. So when Lord Clyde was in Delhi, he was young man, he was sitting on that peacock throne and slept. Young man. So Lord Clyde saw, "Oh, what is this young man?" So the Englishman, then he came to Calcutta. So "You are fortunate, all right I'll make you a king." Britishers they were giving title, king. So he was given the title Raja. So the whole family is Saubhaga (?) Raj family still. This was the Raj. He was a clerk. Why people will not say <span class="Italic">saheb śubha?</span> He became favorite to Lord Clive, and his whole family became Raj family. Still that family is there, those who are known to Calcutta. One of the oldest aristocratic... So all these aristocratic families, they were made by these Britishers. Except the Tagore family. They were from the Mohammedan time. The people became attached to the Europeans. <span class="Italic">Saheb śubha.</span> If you meet one Englishman then your fortune is... I think Bombay was there also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There are many families among those even today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many Parsi families. But they wanted some friends. They were minority. Unless with the cooperation of the Indians, how they could stand? Therefore they introduced the <span class="Italic">zamindar</span> system in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa. Some aristocratic families should cooperate with them. They knew how to rule over. Now by over-cooperating they have become hoax. That verse I very much like.</div>
<div class="Verse">nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke<br class="calibre2"/>kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujām ye<br class="calibre2"/>tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The human life is meant for purifying. They have lost this goal of life. Temporarily we are thinking if we make some comfortable arrangement for body, and that is sufficient. That is sufficient. Lost Vedic culture, ideal life, goal of life. (Hindi) At least in India it should... In other places they are... Therefore this movement's against them. Because we are preaching this philosophy just opposite to their views, they are taking it "brainwashed." Is that all right in your country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They accuse them of brainwashing. But actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot believe that other than this method, there can be civilization. This hoggish civilization is real civilization. To become like hog. That is real civilization. And to give up this process, thinking of soul, elevation of the soul, going back to Godhead, simply imagination, brainwashing. How they can understand? <span class="Italic">Mām aprāpya nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra vartmani</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> Who can understand this? (Hindi) to return (Hindi) to the cycle of birth and death. You believe that. (Hindi) If you do not in this life achieve the sense of spiritual consciousness then you'll have to go back to the cycle of birth and death. Who will understand this philosophy? Mostly they do not know what is the cycle of birth and death, and what to speak of understanding God. This is the position. This is sewer position. A sewer cannot understand. The men have become like that. In the name of so-called civilization. Can a sewer understand this philosophy? A man cannot understand. And what is the difference between him and the sewer? Sewer (Hindi) There is a narration, Brahmā came, and Indra became, by the curse of Bṛhaspati, became a sewer. So he was living in the forest as sewer. Brahmājī came, "All right, your punishment is now over. You come." "Where shall I go?" "The heaven?" "This is heaven." "You have got your kingdom, heaven. You have come to suffer this life." "No no, I cannot go." "Why?" "Now who will take responsibility for my, this sewer?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I like this tale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then Brahmā began to kill his sewerni (?) and his pigs and others, and then he began to cry and took him by force. There is a (indistinct). Even Indra, when he comes under the influence of this <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa,</span> he became happy in the high life of sewer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā duratyayā. Mama māyā duratyayā. Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutaśrava:</span> The governor there, he was making a statement that most institutions in California like hospitals and places like this, they are simply torture chambers. So he made one request that people like priests and monks and Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, if they could go to these places and try to help people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are prepared. If they give us in charge, we are prepared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutaśrava:</span> So in Christmas day Rāmeśvara Mahārāja was planning that many devotees could go there and distribute <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> and some literatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can cure them from material and spiritual diseases. They are now trying to cure them from material ailments. We can cure them from spiritual ailments. Actually, the ailment is spiritual. Material is symptom. (end)</div>
