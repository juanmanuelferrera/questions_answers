<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So Aniruddha, you are going to stay here? You are going to stay? That's nice. He's a big devotee. He says, "I am big devotee." So, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. (devotees and children chant in unison) (aside to Hari-śauri:) Boil with four times water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Boil?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With four times water. And when it is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All boiled down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then squeeze it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When do you want it? Now? (chanting becomes louder and faster, clapping)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chanting ends) Come on. (children laughing) Distribute to the fathers, mothers. Give him one more, he has.... All right, give them first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They came from London, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They came to Paris to see you, and when they learned that you were here, they came all the way here to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, give them this garland. [break] ...he begins with surrender. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So anyone who voluntarily offers obeisances, immediately he becomes fifty percent advanced. Because.... Who is talking? This material world means nobody wants to surrender. Everyone wants to become master: "I am the monarch of all I survey." Everyone is planning how to become a master. Therefore the struggle for existence. Nobody wants to become a servant. You know very well in European history, Napoleon wanted to become the master of all Europe. Hitler wanted also. Similarly, there were so many leaders, sometimes Roman leaders, sometimes Greek leaders, sometimes French leaders, sometimes German leaders, English leader. The whole European history is full of fighting, war. The basic idea is that everyone wanted to become master. That is the material disease. We are now discussing Bali Mahārāja. He also wanted to become master of the whole universe. So that is the material disease. Actually, master is one, Kṛṣṇa. There cannot be two masters. There is only one master, that is Kṛṣṇa, or God. But in the material world, because we have forgotten the real master, every one of us is trying to become master. This is material disease. Not only in one life, but life after life. The cats and dogs, they also want to be master. The dog, if he finds another dog coming, he immediately begins barking very loudly, "Why you are coming here?" So this mastership competition is going on life after life, sometimes as human being, sometimes as animal, sometimes as fish, aquatic, sometimes as demigod, bird. This is the whole material situation. And the difficulty is that we cannot become master, but on account of our false ambition that "I shall become master," we are becoming servants of material nature. We are acting in a certain way to become master, creating a situation, mentality, and at the time of death, when this body finishes, the mind absorbed in that mastership idea takes me to another body according to my ambition, so I become again manifest in different body to exhibit my mastership. Another chapter begins. So they do not know how these subtle laws of material nature is working to give us opportunity to become master according to our idea, false idea. And we are actually suffering, sometimes as human being, sometimes as animal, sometimes as trees, sometimes as dog. So the mastership cannot be attained. That is not possible. In the false idea to become master we are becoming slaves of the laws of material nature. This is real position, and that is suffering. So when one comes to this understanding, that we are not master, we are servant, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> After many, many births, if by chance one gets the association of the servant of the Lord, then he understands that he is not master, he's servant of Kṛṣṇa. And then he surrenders. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Such great soul who has understood that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa," he's a very great soul. <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> Very, very rare to be found. But that is the fact. The sooner we learn that we cannot become master, we are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, let us surrender to Kṛṣṇa and remain in our own position as servant, then it is perfection of life. Therefore one who surrenders, one who offers.... This is the beginning, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">. Namaskuru.</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">namaskuru. Namaskuru</span> means "Just offer your obeisances unto Me." So in the absence of.... Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, but Kṛṣṇa sends His representative. So if we begin, offer <span class="Italic">namaskuru,</span> to the representative, it goes to Kṛṣṇa, and then gradually, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious and becomes situated in his own original consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is perfection of life. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So let us pay our obeisances. (devotees offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What is it? (child whispers "It's a hat") It's a hat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh? You are just now coming? You have got, Mālatī? (speaks Hindi with Indian lady) So what is the news of Amster..., what is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Amsterdam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Amsterdam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee:</span> It is very nice. They are preparing for installation of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa on September lst, and otherwise the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> is distributing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās,</span> about fifteen hundred a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee:</span> Between Holland and Belgium, they both speak the same language, so the books are distributed between these two countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Holland and?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee:</span> Belgium. Parts of Belgium speaks Dutch, and the other half speak French. So in the Belgium, in the half that speaks Dutch, they are taking many <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās.</span> Appreciating it very much. And one library, the head of all the libraries, he has taken an interest in your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How's your father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (2):</span> Um, not as well as you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (2):</span> He's not as well as yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (2):</span> Very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (2):</span> He's looking after roses in his garden. Oh, um...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But your father is young man. What is his age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (2):</span> He's sixty years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty is just like my son. Yes, twenty years difference, father and son. I am eighty, so anyone who is sixty must be like my son. Of course, my first son was born when I was twenty-four, but twenty years, there are many, father. And mother and son, twelve years, thirteen years difference, there are many. So you have come here. Very nice. Stay here. Where is your husband? Bhūgarbha is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He's in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has gone German?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> To buy some trucks for traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's good preacher. He's now distributing books very nicely. You are also good distributor books. Huh? In the beginning she was distributing nicely. So preaching is our life. The more we preach, the more we are successful. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa.</span> This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's preaching.</div>
<div class="Verse">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/>yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa'<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Every one of you become guru and deliver the residents of your neighborhood. <span class="Italic">Ei deśa.</span> Wherever you are living, just deliver them. Become their guru. How to become guru? It is not difficult. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> What Kṛṣṇa has said instruct them. You simply repeat it, that's all. You become guru. So this should be preached all over the world. You learn from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and repeat. You simply say, "Kṛṣṇa said four things: <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> 'Just always think of Me.' Kṛṣṇa said. 'And just become My devotee. Just worship Me and offer obeisances.' Kindly do these things." So if you can induce one person to do these four things, you become guru. Is there any difficulty? Then you become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. How? Always think of Kṛṣṇa. Worship Kṛṣṇa and offer obeisances. Here is our temple, please come, offer obeisances. Offer little flower if you can secure. Otherwise, obeisances sufficient. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You become guru. To inform this message is difficult? Not at all. You may carry the message. If he's fortunate, he'll do it. Even he does not do it, you are carrying the message, you become recognized by Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are doing sincerely, then you are recognized by Kṛṣṇa. Just like a canvasser, salesman, goes to the market, tries his best to secure some business. The master sees the report how he has worked. Even though he has not secured a single paisa business, but he has tried to introduce the goods, then he's bona fide(?). He's bona fide(?). Similarly, we have to simply carry the message of Kṛṣṇa and try to convince people. If one is convinced, it is good, if not, doesn't matter, I am not going to.... Then you are recognized by Kṛṣṇa. Recognition means you become the dearest servant of Kṛṣṇa. Then what do you want more? If Kṛṣṇa recognizes that "You are My most dear servant," then what do you want more? <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this message was to be carried by all Indians. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's desire.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> So all Indians should take up this mission and do welfare activity. That is India's special function. How many devotees are there in Amsterdam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (1):</span> Fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Building is very big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. Nice building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (1):</span> There's two buildings, one for the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> behind the temple, and then the <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> for the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rented or purchased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee (1):</span> We own the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha āśrama,</span> and the temple is rented. It's to our advantage to rent it, for some reason, so they are renting it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You were thinking about walking? It's about 6:15, so this would be a good time if you want to go down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> All glories to Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>August 2, 1976, New Mayapur (French farm)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? You can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There are two sons? And a friend asked, one was very dark... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian system is, the bridegroom... So when the man went to see the girl, the father called his son, bridegroom's father, "My dear Gauracand, please come here." So he came. He was just like a black negro. And <span class="Italic">gauracānda</span> means fair complexion. So one of the party came to see. So, "This is in your country <span class="Italic">gauracānda</span>, so where is <span class="Italic">kālacānda,</span> can you bring him?" So that is the respectable gentleman, and what is debauch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kālacānda</span> means black, very black. <span class="Italic">Gaura</span> means fair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When Gauracand was called, a black negro came. So if Kalacand is called, who will come then? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There seems to be such an amazing repertoire of stories and analogies in the Bengali language, isn't there? So many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bengal the, just like here, so many, black mixed up with white. In Bengal and Madras, so many Dravidian have been mixed up with the Āryan. Therefore in Bengal and Madras you'll find many black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Dravidian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dravidian culture. Dravida. They are non-Āryans. Just like these Africans, they are not Āryans. Now they are mixing up with Europeans and Americans. In India, it was, one from the higher section, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> they will be fair complexion. <span class="Italic">Śūdras,</span> black. So if a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> becomes black, then he's not accepted as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Kāla bahu</span> (?). And if a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> becomes fair, then he's to be know that he's not pure <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Although we do not take very, but, this <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> by birth, but still, we have seen, those who are coming purely from high caste family, their behavior and <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> behavior is different. The family culture. And the spiritual culture lost, still, the family culture keeps them separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Still, we still met a lot of people in India who are actually following the regulative principles just as a matter of social training. But they're becoming very few now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In, actually, in Bengal, Bengal has lost its original culture. In other provinces the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class, they are keeping very strictly the original culture. Even a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> would not accept foodstuff prepared by his wife, because woman is considered <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> The woman, when she becomes the wife of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then she is called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇī,</span> but she's not offered brahminical culture. She remains as <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So therefore a strict <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> does not accept foodstuff prepared by his wife. Still there are in U.P. The wife will arrange for cooking, and he'll sit down and cook <span class="Italic">dāl, cāpāṭis.</span> Then he will eat, and whatever remains, that is there, that will be taken by her. But he will not take foodstuff cooked by his even wife. And if there are several <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> so each one of them will cook his own food. In Calcutta, mostly the rich men they used to keep the collector's <span class="Italic">darwans</span>, they are called <span class="Italic">darwans</span>. Means guard, policemen, guard. They're all, very big, big <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, they used to take, accept the job. But each of them, even in police, I have seen, they are cooking separately. They take bath thrice, cook their own food, very strictly. The government had to give them a big hall for cooking. So, it will not take much space, say, little space. One small oven and demarcated: "This, you see, is mine, and then I, you get, this is yours, this is yours." So within that space they'll sit down and cook <span class="Italic">dāl, cāpāṭis,</span> rice, one vegetable, and cook, and immediately all the utensils will be cleansed and washed, and the space washed and kept. You'd like to eat, they cook so nicely, although simple. And I have got practical experience, if you cook your own food, whatever it may be, it is healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That a fact, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you do it very carefully, then you'll never get disease. Take simple food, neat and clean, you'll not get disease. So everything depends on eating to keep the health proper. But these things can be simplified when the life is simple. If I go to work in office at this time, then so many things become topsy-turvied. But if you depend on yourself, either as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> you haven't got to depend on others, then you can do timely. Now we have to go fifty miles at least to attend office. In your country at least, this is the system. They are coming from Long Island, Liberty Island. In New York I have seen. Three, four hours to go to work. And again three, four hours to come to home. And work there eight hours. Then what is value? He's shattered. He has no other solace than wine, and he has no other culture. No family, dog friend (laughter) and television idea, that's all. What his life? Every man has got a dog friend because he has no family. Men, women, and television, engagement, I have seen it, all this, in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they do go out, it's just to go and get drunk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still, our landlord in 26 Second Avenue, if there is anything wrong in the apartment, he would personally do it. He could spare money to call a worker. He was alone. I don't think he had any dog, but he was always seeing the television, and when there was some complaint, he would come and work on it. He's landlord. And so many tenant, there is complaint always. Old house. That house was not very good, very old house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There was many stories?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think five, six stories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. You just had the shop at the bottom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bottom shop and the first floor, I took my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> With a garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not a garden, but there was some vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Few plants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not bad. For me, it was very convenient, come down immediately to my down storefront. And some boys were living in the storefront. There was a sink in the storefront, and for toilet I allowed them sometimes in my bathroom. Not some, only two or one. So he was washing my dishes also. In this way, I was living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was Mukunda, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that was another boy. He was drunkard. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yogeśvara has many pictures of those meetings at 26 Second Avenue, with Hayagrīva with the beard and the long hair hitting this... There's pictures of all those meetings, photographs. Of Hayagrīva with the beard and long hair hitting the gong next to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Long hairs almost everyone. This Umāpati was also one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He said he was eating meat up until the point you gave him the beads on the day of initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hayagrīva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, Umāpati. He said then, next, from that point he gave up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They were trained up in such a way from the beginning of their life. I have seen small children they give powdered meat mixed with hot water and spoon. Is it now? What can be done? Poor child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They made them eat meat. My nephew used to refuse, so they used to force him to eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, by nature refusing, and by force...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They they develop a taste. My mother said that I used to refuse as well, but then they made me. Now I got a taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in my childhood, when I was one and one-half years old, I suffered from typhoid, and the Dr. Karttika Candra Bose, he said that he, "Please give him chicken juice." So my father refused: "No, no, we cannot." "No, no he has to be given. Now he has become very weak." "No, no, I cannot allow." "Don't mind, I shall prepare in my own house and send. You simply..." So it was sent from his house, and when it was given to me, immediately I began to vomit. And my father threw it away, and when the doctor asked that this was the... "No, no, then don't bother." This story I heard. This allopathetic system of medicine introduced all these things in India. Otherwise they did not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This meat-eating, chicken juice, tea, these things are unknown to India. No, why India? By nature, you say that you refused meat. Although you were born of a father and mother meat-eaters, still. What a horrible civilization they have made. He's human being born. Making him animal by culture. Instead of making him more cultured towards the spiritual life, making him redirected again to animal life. This is the civilization, Western civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, there's not much choice, not any choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These children are fortunate. Yesterday I was astonished how these children were receiving just like friend, laughing and something saying, you have seen it? As an old friend. Their mother pushes they would not come, but they were very glad to see me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everybody's very glad to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was astonished, that how these children take me as friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't think that's too difficult. You're the best friend for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but after all, they are children. How they can take it as it is? So they are fortunate children, and their parents and everyone should take care of them. A very difficult age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You always said they're our asset for the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they can be trained up, they can become very good preacher, each one of them. And they can make hundreds of devotees. In this way we can expand. Are you realizing that there is no civilization? Actually civilization we are introducing. Except Aryan civilization, Vedic civilization, there is no civilization-animal society. What do you think? Are you convinced about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, yes, every time I walk out the door I'm convinced. And when you come back to the temple, it's marvelous, the spiritual world. No matter what going on, may be bad, may be good, doesn't matter. It's very relieving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Civilization means to push the man forward for perfection. That is civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Development.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Society and economic condition, everything should be so arranged that this human child should be gradually pushed for perfection of life, go back home, back to Godhead. This is civilization. And modern civilization is "Don't care for what is going to happen. So long you live, eat, drink, be merry, enjoy," that's all. Sense gratification. This is called <span class="Italic">nāstika-vāda.</span> Very dangerous. And that is going on all over the world. How a gentleman can live in that society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can't. Gradually people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore my Guru Mahārāja used to say, "This is not a place for a gentleman." Formerly, therefore, they used to go away from the society, go in the forest, to give up this bad association. Live alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Practically speaking, that's what we've done. By your establishing these temples, it's given us someplace to go where we can get out of Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore our temples should be very carefully managed. It may not become again another pandemonium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Pan-demon. Pan-demon-ium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Says that in the dictionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Place of demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa has given us many nice places. People can live very comfortably. There will be no scarcity. Cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. That is wanted. Therefore in this old age I am struggling so much to see that things are going on nicely. So far I have seen, it is going on nice. But maybe the management is lacking. It may be the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is very strong. So be careful. All, you are all old students, and try to organize more and more solidly. The children should be taken, you can give lectures to the mothers, that children should be taken care of. They are future hopes. Child is the father of man. They say that we escape. What we are escaping? We have got all types of social society. There is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> there is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> there is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> Whichever position is suitable, you accept and keep yourself sincere, that's all. Unnatural there is nothing. Is there anything unnatural? And if they think that we're prohibiting this meat-eating, this is unnatural, that we cannot. That is not unnatural, that is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I notice these four things, they are very unnatural, these four sinful things, very unnatural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unnatural, yes. What for smoking? What for drinking? How nicely they sit down on the ground and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Why there is need of table, chair and these dishes and fork and knife and so on, so on? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's hard to cut the meat. You need a good surface. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Bon Mahārāja, once I was eating in his festival and... He's a <span class="Italic">bara-sahib. </span>So he has given fork and knife. (laughs) So I did not know, I do not remember even which way I took fork. So Bon Mahārāja began to criticize "You are going to foreign country you do not know which hand to take this fork and knife." So I told him, "I am not going to learn all these things. I am going to teach them something else, to forget it. (laughter) You went to learn all these things. But I am not going to learn anything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What did he say to that? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's following the line of Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how rascal they are. My Guru Mahārāja every step condemned this Ramakrishna Mission and Vivekananda. He said frankly that if there are any impediments for our movement, that is this Gandhi and Vivekananda. He said frankly. Hodge-podge. Gandhi's also hodge-podge. He was a politician, and in politics he mixed some spiritual ideas, hodge-podge. And this Vivekananda was also politician. His name was recorded in the government as "<span class="Italic">sannyāsī-</span>politician." Because after returning from America, he began to preach to make the poor man rich, and these weak, fatty, and so on, exercise. So the government took it that he's, under the dress of a s<span class="Italic">annyāsī,</span> he's preaching social and political upliftment. So his name was recorded as "<span class="Italic">sannyāsī-</span>politician." And his name was also recorded, "political saint," Gandhi. After all, the British government, they were very intelligent. They could understand what is what. Otherwise, how they were managing this big empire? Very intelligent, there is no doubt about it. And actually they were intelligent. When they were managing, we were happy, actually. Nobody can deny it. Although they were exploiting. But nobody could understand. Everyone was feeling happy. And as soon as they left, everyone is unhappy. That distinction I can give evidence, I can, from my personal experience. Things were very, very nice. Calcutta, oh, it was so nice city. Now it is hell. It is same Calcutta. Why it is now hell? Hidden(?) garden, that was a nice garden. So... Everywhere hell, only hell. Calcutta was considered the nicest city in India, better than Bombay, but it has become now hell. The streets, especially those quarters in our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think Calcutta was voted the second dirtiest city in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> Just see. And it was next to London. People used to say, "In the British Empire, first London, second Calcutta." And now it is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Second dirtiest city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is the first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Karachi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Karachi. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of them got <span class="Italic">sva-rāja,</span> Pakistan and India. That means after getting <span class="Italic">sva-rāja</span>..., Karachi was one of the first-class city, yes. They cannot manage. Unfit persons, they are on the top of government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seems everything is devolving at a phenomenal rate. Every decade that passes, everything breaks down twice as fast. Just in the last twenty years or thirty years everything has become so much degraded and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have got experience. I am Calcutta born. What Calcutta was in our childhood days and what is now, I know everything. How we were happy during British days and what is now position, I can speak from my personal experience. We do not belong to the richest class nor to the poor class-middle class. So we have got practical experience. My father's income was not more than 250 rupees. How opulent we were. At least, there was no question of need. We were receiving daily four, five guests, and my father was functioning so many festivals and he was asking... My father gave in marriage four daughters. There was no difficulty. The income was not more than 250 rupees. Of course, that 250 rupees at least ten times now. But still, there was no needy. Not very opulent, but there was no need. The first necessity is to feed and to clothe. So there was no such scarcity. May not be very luxurious life, but there was no scarcity for food and shelter or cloth. There was no scarcity. Happy. That is wanted. Happiness in whatever circumstance. Not that because we did not possess a motorcar, therefore unhappy. I purchased one motor car in 1925, Buick car. Not for personal use, but for using it as a taxi. My one nephew, he was a good driver, so my father, "Why don't you give him? He can do that, we can use it our own car also taxi." So I took it, Buick car, I think I paid eight thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Buick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buick, yes, very strong car. At that time, Ford, Chevrolet and Buick, these cars were very popular in India. Ford for the poorer class and Buick for the first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Your nephew was a taxi driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Nephew was my sister's son. We had to maintain one sister and her family. She became widow. So this is Hindu family obligation. When the daughter is widow, she comes to the father's shelter with all family. The father has to maintain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You wouldn't get that in the West. (laughs) They don't even maintain their own parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the whole, during British time, people were happy, that I can... The thing is that Britishers were little afraid that "If the government is not good, it will go against our credit, that we may agitate." So they were careful to see that people are happy. But here nobody's careful. Everyone thinks "I'm in my own country. Whatever I do, it is all right." They were conscious, that "We are foreigners. If the management is not good, then it will go against our credit and it will be difficult working such a big England empire." So they were little careful. But these rascals are not... Just like the governor, he was friendly, but what is the report? Did he say? Did not behave very nicely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He wasn't interested to help for the tax exemption.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, you told me before, Bon Mahārāja and Tīrtha Mahārāja, they were writing all these big, big men, but they told them frankly, that "I'm not going to do anything for you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> None of them. Formerly, a British governor, secretary, was a friend. You could get some service from him. The Britishers they knew the etiquette that if friends ask some help, I must help you. That is etiquette.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now there's so much self-interest, they don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is expected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Still, due to the British presence, isn't that the main reason why India has become so degraded now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because they introduced so many bad things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, from cultural point of view, they are degraded. And that was that British policy, to kill them culturally. Otherwise not possible to rule over them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They always advertised that India was so backward because that was a justification for their being there, that "We shall go and educate."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They used to advertise like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then they could exploit and avoid criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so many bad things Britishers introduced. Bad things means Western type of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sometimes people, they say, we're always glorifying Indian culture, so why are they so badly off? So we tell them it's because they've give up the culture that they're badly off. Otherwise, a hundred years ago there was no problem. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The whole country could be like this if everybody was Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very peacefully you can live. In the city you go, thousands of cars are running-<span class="Italic">ror-ror-ror-ror-ror-ror-ror.</span> What is called? Flyway, expressway, downway, every ten yards stop for the light. (laughter) How artificial life. And with all these things, if people would have been happy, all right. But they're not happy, in spite of all this advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. Simply increasing their miseries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The bigger the buildings, the more anxiety they're in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only many cars, they construct new roads, new... Increasing business, in the hope of happiness. But there is no happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Happiness is the last consideration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are thinking that "In this way we shall be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Get more money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, paved way, then flyway, then another flyway, then another flyway, in this way. <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're always striving for happiness, that's all. They never achieve it, they never get there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like the animal is running after the mirage, water, but there is no water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He simply runs until he dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Dogs on four wheels. (laughs) It was so nice sitting underneath the tree there, chanting. I was thinking, this is what we could do forever, twenty-four hours. No need to do anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) Prospective place, this. Very future prospect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, yes. We're buying these big properties now, we don't have so many devotees, but we know just even in five years they're going to be packed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Maybe now we don't have so many devotees for all these big places we're buying, but even just in five years or ten years they'll be full. We'll have to expand more and more. Your idea for fifty percent for books, fifty percent for buildings is very wonderful. I remember in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> you said that the book distribution and the establishment of temples should go parallel lines, side by side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Going on. Up to date, to my satisfaction, it is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you're satisfied, then we know it's going to be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they fight amongst themselves, the GBCs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm, that's the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not see Harikeśa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. He's been feeling a bit ill today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is thyme herbs? No. This is the seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, them. They grow it in the garden. The first, what you got, that was grown here. Those twigs? They were grown here in the garden. Would you like anything tonight? A piece of <span class="Italic">chavana-prash?</span> (Harikeśa comes in)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This boy brought this. I wanted to just ask you if this is any good or not. This is nutmeg oil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the oil I was telling you about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And this is Ax Brand Universal Oil, supposed to be for massages or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chinese?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (indistinct) This is Chinese.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Supposed to be for massaging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's supposed to help the muscles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nutmeg oil. This is the one I was telling you about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're all selling all this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, this is not ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Rādhe-Śyāma dāsa brought this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It was brought by one of the devotees from-Thailand, was is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He was in Kuala-Lumpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He says he bought it from a Buddhist temple, big Buddhist temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kuala-Lumpur? There is a big Buddhist temple I know, I went there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He said in a letter, he just wrote a letter to you that... You laid a cornerstone in some temple? About three, four years ago?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kuala-Lumpur? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's finished. It cost a million dollars. And he says this man wants to give it to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, something, that gentleman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's a rather nice letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Written by him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, this boy who was there. I'll bring him tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can take it. Yes. This is nice idea. He has spent millions of dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> One million on the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh? How he got the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe he was rich man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This was made in Penang.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Penang also I visited. I stayed with one Indian gentleman. His wife made very nice <span class="Italic">kacuri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It doesn't matter wherever you go around the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They asked, "What you want to eat?" "If you can, you make first-class <span class="Italic">kacuri</span>." That is from my childhood. My friends also did it. They'd make the first-class <span class="Italic">kacuris</span> in my youthhood. I am fond of <span class="Italic">kacuri. Kacuri</span> is made first class in Mathurā. Agra and Mathurā. Very, very nice. The <span class="Italic">kacuri</span> is being made, hundreds of customers waiting. At shops, there was many shops, waiting for purchasing. And as soon as it comes out of the pan, immediately sold. There is no question of waiting. They make spice nicest. That is India's craftsmanship. Nobody will starve. If you have no business, you prepare something palatable, and people will purchase, all over India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's so many people on the railway station selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There's no question of starvation for want of money. Anywhere sit down and do something palatable, and people will purchase. So your livelihood will go on. <span class="Italic">Pakorā, kacuri, jalebi,</span> anything. You make some palatable, people are fond of eating some palatable things. That is their hobby. In Allahabad, there was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> I had my business, and he was neighborhood, he was living. So in the morning, the husband and wife would go to take bath in the Ganges. They would very nicely take bath, and while coming they will purchase some ingredients and then come home. The husband will perform <span class="Italic">pūjā,</span> etc., and the wife will prepare many nice preparations-<span class="Italic">baḍā, pakori, puskar</span> (?), this, that. Then he'll take his meals, rest awhile, and in the evening he will sit down, he was sitting just in front of my shop, about four or five o'clock. All the preparations his wife had made whole day, and the small shop. And the university students will come up to night, ten o'clock, he'll finish. Nothing will remain. Everything will be... And he'll make at least ten rupees profit, minimum. In those days, 1925, in those days ten rupees means nowadays at least fifty rupees. So, and living very happy. Living humbly as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he was having his <span class="Italic">pūjā,</span> going to the Ganges, taking bath, husband and wife, in the morning, and the wife's business is to prepare and his business was to sell. So they'll make at least ten, fifteen rupees profit daily, very prosperous. Living peacefully, husband and wife. There are many such families. The... If wife is very good, then his home is very nice. They cannot be unhappy at any circumstances. <span class="Italic">Dampatyoḥ kalaho nāsti tatra śrīḥ svayam āgataḥ.(?)</span> Cāṇakya Paṇḍita. When there is full agreement between husband and wife, cooperation, then the goddess of fortune comes there without application. You haven't got to ask goddess of fortune, "Please come and help me." She'll come automatically. This is Cāṇakya Paṇḍita's instruction.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">There are so many things in India culture for becoming happy and advancing towards the goal of life. Now I am appreciating for more and more, seeing the whole world, what is India's culture. Formerly I was thinking, "It is custom. To become faithful wife, this is custom." But when I come outside I see what is wife and what is faithful wife. In India, still, in the village, even there is fight between husband, wife, the wife is faithful. Still. Completely dependent on husband. The husband also, in spite of fighting, is always careful that the wife does not get any inconvenience. It was the culture, now it is breaking. (about door or window) You can close that. In material world, for peaceful life, there must be peaceful condition between the husband and wife. Everyone requires wife, everyone requires husband. Sex is necessary, so make the condition of sex very peaceful. Why disturbed? Make the condition that there will be... It is necessary. As eating is necessary, sleeping is necessary, for ordinary man, so sex is also necessary. So make a condition so that nothing will be disturbed, and in undisturbed condition of mind execute spiritual advancement. This is Indian civilization. Aim is spiritual advancement. And to make condition favorable, there are so many things. So unless we get favorable condition... Here in the Western countries there is no favorable condition. First of all, they have no idea of spiritual life, the goal of life, neither there is favorable condition. And gradually things are becoming degrading. On my last tour in Chicago I saw. In three weeks she has twice divorced, one lady's advertised. You remember it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I wasn't there that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I remember.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I cannot tolerate being sick any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body means sickness. The body itself is sickness.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, little better. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...thinking of how to utilize the whole land. The situation is very good, good prospect. I want that self-independent here, as far as possible. But you have got enough materials. With woods you can make cottages. Then land becomes clear, then utilize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cows, so many things. Free from all anxieties, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Life is meant for simply chanting. This should be the motto. But because we have got this body, we have to maintain it. That much. Otherwise, we have no ambition to become a very big man in this material world, enjoy it. This is all false, useless. He'll become a big man, and one day death comes and kicks him out. So these are all false attempts. It has no meaning. The meaningful life is, so long we live, become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. And <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted. Give facility to the people. Here is very nice arrangement. Now make plan how to utilize. You have got enough land. You can utilize for supplying the necessities of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's a very wonderful place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We can get many wonderful places like this all over the world. But they have not been taught how to utilize them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> But I think in one year they have done nicely. They have built a greenhouse and planted all the cultivated land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are working hard, there is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And the temple also, Deity worship and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, things are going nicely. There is no doubt about it. And children should be given that much education-to read and write and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The devotees are talking how nice it was to sit outside with you and chant and hear you speak tonight. I remember the last time I was in New Vrindaban many years ago, when I first became a devotee. You were sitting outside, giving some lecture, series of lectures on Vyāsadeva and the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, I like this life, from my very childhood. And on our roof there were trees, plants, flower plants, and... My grandmother, she... We, all grandchildren used to water it. So downstairs we took water in, what is called? A <span class="Italic">jhāri?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Sprinkling can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, sprinkling can. We all grandchildren, we were about half a dozen. So we took very much pleasure in watering. But my special tendency was that along with the plants, I, with the bushes, I'll sit down. My tendency. And I'll sit down for hours. And like that. In my childhood. In my maternal uncle's house also, I was doing that. As soon as I find some bush, I make a sitting place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's hard to see how people could not be attracted to such a nice life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> But more and more people are coming.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"According to their <span class="Italic">karma,</span> all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. By the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a nice purport. Should I read the purport? "When we speak of <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍa,</span> we refer to the whole universe, or to the cluster of many millions of universes. In all universes, there are innumerable planets and innumerable living entities upon those planets in the air and in the water. There are millions and trillions of living entities everywhere, and they are engaged by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> in suffering and enjoying the results of their fruitive activity life after life. This is the position of the materially conditioned living entities. Out of many of these living entities, if one is actually fortunate (<span class="Italic">bhāgyavān</span>), he comes in contact with a bona fide spiritual master by Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart, and if one desires something, Kṛṣṇa fulfills one's desire. If the living entity by chance or fortune comes in contact with the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and wishes to associate with that movement, Kṛṣṇa, who is situated in everyone's heart, gives him the chance to meet a bona fide spiritual master. This is called <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāda.</span> Kṛṣṇa is prepared to bestow His mercy upon all living entities, and as soon as a living entity desires the Lord's mercy, the Lord immediately gives him an opportunity to meet a bona fide spiritual master. Such a person is fortified by both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master. He is helped from within by Kṛṣṇa and from without by the spiritual master. Both are prepared to help the sincere living being become free from this material bondage. How one can become this fortunate can be seen in the life of Śrīla Nārada Muni. In his previous life he was born of a maidservant. Although he was not born into a prestigious position, his mother was fortunately engaged in rendering service to some Vaiṣṇavas. When these Vaiṣṇavas were resting during the <span class="Italic">cāturmāsya</span> period, the boy Nārada took the opportunity to engage in their service. Taking compassion upon the boy, the Vaiṣṇavas offered him the remnants of their food. By serving them and obeying their orders, the boy became the object of sympathy for the Vaiṣṇavas, and, by the Vaiṣṇavas' unknown mercy, he gradually became a pure devotee. In the next life he was Nārada Muni, the most exalted of Vaiṣṇavas and the most important guru and <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of Vaiṣṇavas. Following in the footsteps of Nārada Muni, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is rendering service to humanity by giving everyone a chance to come in contact with Kṛṣṇa. If one is fortunate, he becomes intimately related with this movement. Then, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, one's life becomes successful. Everyone has dormant <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti,</span> love for Kṛṣṇa, and in the association of good devotees, that love is revealed. As stated in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span>:</div>
<div class="Verse">nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema 'sādhya' kabhu naya<br class="calibre2"/>śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. madhya 22.107]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Dormant devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is within everyone. Simply by associating with devotees, hearing their good instructions and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> dormant love for Kṛṣṇa is awakened. In this way one acquires the seed of devotional service. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then? No, it is not finished? Next verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mālī hañā kare sei bīja āropaṇa<br class="calibre2"/>śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.152]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"When a person receives the seed of devotional service, he should take care of it by becoming a gardener and sowing the seed in his heart. If he waters the seed gradually by the process of <span class="Italic">śravaṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> (hearing and chanting), the seed will begin to sprout." Purport: "To live with devotees or to live in a temple means to associate with the <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana</span> process. Sometimes neophyte devotees think that they can continue the <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana</span> process without worshiping the Deity, but the execution of <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana</span> is meant for highly developed devotees like Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who engaged in the <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana</span> process without worshiping the Deity. However, one should not falsely imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura and abandon Deity worship just to try to engage in <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana.</span> This is not possible for neophyte devotees. The word <span class="Italic">guru-prasāda</span> indicates that the spiritual master is very merciful in bestowing the boon of devotional service upon the disciple. That is the best possible gift the spiritual master has to offer. Those with a background of pious life are eligible to receive life's supreme benefit, and to bestow this benefit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends His representative to impart His mercy. Endowed with the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master distributes the mercy to those who are elevated and pious. Thus the spiritual master trains his disciples to render devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called <span class="Italic">guru-kṛpā.</span> It is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasāda,</span> Kṛṣṇa's mercy, that He sends a bona fide spiritual master to the deserving disciple. By the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, one meets the bona fide spiritual master, and by the mercy of the spiritual master, the disciple is fully trained in the devotional service of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-latā-bīja</span> means 'the seed of devotional service.' Everything has an original cause, or seed. For any idea, program, plan or device, there is first of all the contemplation of the plan, and that is called <span class="Italic">bīja,</span> or the seed. The methods, rules and regulations by which one is perfectly trained in devotional service constitute the <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja,</span> or the seed of devotional service. This <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja</span> is received from the spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. Other seeds are called <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣa-bīja, karma-bīja</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna-bīja.</span> If one is not fortunate enough to receive the <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja</span> from the spiritual master, he instead cultivates the seeds of <span class="Italic">karma-bīja, jñāna-bīja,</span> or political and social or philanthropic <span class="Italic">bīja.</span> However, <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja</span> is different from these other <span class="Italic">bījas. Bhakti-latā-bīja</span> can be received only through the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore one has to satisfy the spiritual master to get <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja (yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **). Bhakti-latā-bīja</span> is the origin of devotional service. Unless one satisfies the spiritual master, he gets the <span class="Italic">bīja,</span> or root cause, of <span class="Italic">karma, jñāna</span> and yoga without the benefit of devotional service. However, one who is faithful to his spiritual master gets the <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja.</span> This <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja</span> is received when one is initiated by the bona fide spiritual master. After receiving the spiritual master's mercy, one must repeat his instructions, and this is called <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana</span>-hearing and chanting. One who has not properly heard from the spiritual master or who does not follow the regulative principles is not fit for chanting (<span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>). This is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>: <span class="Italic">vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>2.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has not listened carefully to the instructions of the spiritual master is unfit to chant or preach the cult of devotional service. One has to water the <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā-bīja</span> after receiving instructions from the spiritual master." I remember in Hawaii, this section here, it says a person is fortified by both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, and you said that Kṛṣṇa gives you the weapon and the spiritual master sharpens it, the weapon of knowledge, and in that way we can become free from material bondage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The classes should be regularly held. Those who are engaged in the field work, then let them work, but woman or others, they should hear in the class. They should attend.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What they understand, all rascals? Wasting time. Going to the moon planet, going to the Mars planet. Why? What you will gain? Still they are going. Simply spending money. In Bengal it is called <span class="Italic">ostādi. Ostādi,</span> in English? One who places himself as very intelligent leader.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This time, if they say that there is no life in the Mars, they'll never get next chance, he said. I think it is meaningful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It will substantiate our claim.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Irrigation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way make it ever green.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There was a question about the cows, that at what point should the calf be separated from the mother. Because sometimes when the calf is separated, the mother, she cries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they should not be taken away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Shouldn't be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think in all our farms they do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I heard in New Vrindaban they took them away very early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The problem is that the calves drink so much milk that they become very sick, so they have to separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they should not be allowed always. Once in a day, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not too much allowed, but once. At least while milking they should be allowed to drink little milk, and that will encourage the mother to deliver more milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. At the same time they're milking the cow, the calf can come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They can bring it milk. And while milking, the calf may be standing before the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They do that in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So she will not be sorry. Completely separation is not good. And after birth at least for one week the calf should be allowed. Because after this giving birth the milk is not fit for human consumption. The calf should not be allowed to eat more, but at the same time the mother must see once, twice, then it will be all right. Of course, we are born in big, big towns, we do not know, but I know this is the process. In Allahabad I was keeping cow, there was facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I don't think our farms are doing like that. In New Vrindaban they do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What, letting the calves come? I don't think so. You can write a letter to... The whole system's so perfect, it's completely satisfying in every respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you make others dissatisfied for your pleasure, that is sinful. You should act in such a way that nobody is dissatisfied. Then there is balance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Expert management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got puffed rice?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Puffed rice. This <span class="Italic">Chavana-prash,</span> it says five to ten grams every morning with milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With milk. Five to ten grams.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that's like a heaped spoonful. I think that's about what you're getting there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever we take, that is five to ten grams?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Approximately. Maybe a little more.</div>
