<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this? Oh. For taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Would you like a plate, Swamiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should always take in his hand. That is the system. Not in a plate. That means if you take in a plate, you'll take much. (laughter) So in hand, he cannot take much. <span class="Italic">Kara-pātrī.</span> That is the instruction. But in this age such strict laws cannot be followed. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says that when there is flat grass cushion, why should you ask for bedding? When you have got natural pillow, this hand, why you ask for a pillow? Then when there is river, so much water, why do you stock water? When there are fruits in the tree, why do you go and beg? When there is cave, why you are searching after apartment? (laughs) When the old garments are thrown in the street, then why you are searching after clothing? These are the instructions. Completely free. <span class="Italic">Kasmād bhajanti kavayo dhana-durmadandhān [SB </span>2.2.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why should you go and flatter these monied men? That is complete independence. But those days are now gone. (laughs) It is a different age. Los Angeles, I think it is a good place. Hm? What is your...? Your problem solved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Good news. We went to the Hollywood police station and the man told us that part of the duty of the police station is to... He said he should protect religious people like us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He mentioned other religious people, and he said if we can just keep the crowd moving, then we have every right to be there. So he has given us right to go to Hollywood. In downtown Los Angeles we don't have that right yet. We'll still go there, but in Hollywood it is all right. So that's good enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. It is Kṛṣṇa's grace. I was telling the same thing to Dayānanda, that he should present this case to the higher officer. That's all. We are preaching God consciousness. We should be given... That was the Vedic law. Saintly persons, they should be given all protection. If somebody insulted a saintly person, there was a special punishment for that. That's all right. So you take that house, that is Hollywood quarter? Hm. Give him more. No. I have got. You take. Oh, Nandarāṇī is outside? Why she is outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> It's the baby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Baby was not disturbing. I have received one letter from San Francisco. They are shortage of men. So Dinadayal is going back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh no. We need more men here. (Prabhupāda laughs) We are so short. That is the problem. We have too few people here. Dīnadayālu is so essential. I was just going to ask you if we could have some more men. Jayarāma...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Create men. Bring some men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Recruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is a new boy, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> He's very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You have not taken <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span> You have taken these fruits? This is the first time you come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Boy:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> If you live with people... If you live around people and they say offensive things, because they are ignorant or they are sinful as you say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Try to excuse them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Do I leave...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Excuse them. I shouldn't move out of there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As far as possible tolerate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Tolerate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all crazy. Yes. They are crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Just one man, the owner. I asked him so many times if he would make room for, to have a meeting. The place is gigantic. You know cause you stayed there. Remember? At that motel. He said he didn't have any room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They have got very big hall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> So I was just wondering maybe I should... You know, well, if that's how they're going to act, then I should move out of there. But I don't know. I don't know if that's the right attitude on my part. I don't know. They say they didn't have any room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you are... Govinda dāsī? (end)</div>
