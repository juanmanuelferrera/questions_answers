<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...things of value, they're disappearing. Just like formerly people used to have some dishes of valuable metals. Now it is plastic. This is the advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's what they call.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascals, they are thinking it is advancement. And if he goes to sell the plastic plates, nobody will pay even cent. But one of those metal plate, if he's in difficulty, he can get some money. This is scientific advancement. Instead of gold coins, now there is papers: "I trust in God. We trust in God." Cheating, "We trust in God." Take hundred dollars. And what is this hundred dollars? It is paper. "We trust in God." By the name of God, I give you. And it is scientific. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They call it convenience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They call it convenience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, convenience means going to hell. That's all. It is very convenient to go to hell. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa. Everything synthetic. Cotton is disappearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Everything's artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artificial. And the scientists, they are giving this clue: "Oh, now we have produced something very valuable. Take it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, when Dupont made the first nylon, it was a great..., praised all over the, all over the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What for? What for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because they produced the synthetic fibers, nylons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless. And big, big cars. They are charging thousands and thousands of dollars. But what it is? Tin car. As soon as the machine gone, nobody will pay for the tin even. Especially in this country, they are thrown away to the garbage. No value. (pause) In India, we have seen still, they are going on. People stock metal utensils. You know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, we use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never use this china clay. Never. No respectable gentleman will use china clay. Still. So if a poor family is in need of money, immediately he can take one Benarsee sari, or some metal utensils to the pawn maker. He'll immediately offer some money. "Yes." So these are conveniences. Investment was in gold ornaments. Still we have seen that so many jewelry shop, silver dishes shop, ornament shop. Still. Every marriage, the father must give at least fifty <span class="Italic">tolās.</span> I was not a rich man. Still I had to give to my daughter fifty <span class="Italic">tolās</span> of gold during marriage. Fifty <span class="Italic">tolās.</span> Two and a half <span class="Italic">tolās</span> makes one ounce. So what is the value of fifty <span class="Italic">tolās?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Twenty-five ounces? Right now that's worth about two thousand, three hundred dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. So that is her stock. <span class="Italic">Strī-dhana.</span> The husband cannot touch. Then it is criminal. So in case of need, she can convert the ornaments into money. Sometimes there is disagreement with the husband. So she has got some stock. The father gives some ornaments. The father-in-law gives some ornament. The relatives also, during marriage, they present some ornaments. So if he, if she gets hundred <span class="Italic">tolās</span> of gold, that means at least five hundred...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Almost five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, five thousand dollars. She has got some assets. That is called <span class="Italic">strī-dhana. Strī-dhana</span> means "woman's property." Nobody can touch it. Only, according to <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> law, <span class="Italic">strī-dhana...</span> Now they are changing. <span class="Italic">Strī-dhana,</span> the son cannot touch, the husband cannot touch. Nobody can touch. But, after her death, the daughters will share that money. Because formerly, the daughters could not get share of the father's estate. Only the dowry which is given by the father at the time of her marriage. That much. But she could not claim any estate share. Therefore at the time of marriage, the dowry by ornaments, saris. Hundred pieces of sari. If one is rich man. All Benarsee sari, costly. And woman's nature is that if she gets good ornaments, saris, good food, she's satisfied. She doesn't want anything. She'll never become faithless to her husband. So these things are disappearing. Now rich man, rich man's wife, no ornament. (indistinct). Only the widows, they were without ornaments. Any woman who has got husband must have ornaments. Otherwise, insult. So individual liberty, individual prosperity, everything is disappearing. By the scientific improvement. That's all. This is the net result. Now in your country, that... What is that? Draft board? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Draft board?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Calling young men to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Drafting... The army?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They don't do it anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? They do not do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They stopped it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they saw: "Now we are producing more hippies for this. Only for, on account of this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So the, the material world itself is very temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The material world itself is temporary. So the scientists still make it much more temporary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> By investing, by, by finding out the different ways of..., they're called conveniences. So by producing these things makes much more comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Easier. Easier to die. They have invented the atomic. Very easy to kill. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa ... (pause) But, in, despite all these disadvantages, if the scientists bring in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then that is success. It will be success. The sea, without waves, does not look well. Without waves, when the sea's calm and quiet, it does not look well. What do you think? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It does not look well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now with waves it looks beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So that is the property of the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everything has got some quality and beauty. Just like Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says: <span class="Italic">nārīṇāṁ bhūṣaṇaṁ patiḥ.</span> Woman, the personal beauty is not beauty. When she has got a husband, then she's beautiful. How scientific it is. All these girls in your country, without husband, they're all morose, unhappy. They have no fixity of husband. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The woman population is greater everywhere, and if they have no husband, they're very sorry. I have studied in this country. They're very unhappy without husband. Therefore I introduced this marriage in our society. Now in our society see all the women with children, how happy they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got Kṛṣṇa, they have got husband, they have got children. Now, happy they are. They're working hard for beauty of the home, for the temple. And now last night that Mukunda's cousin sister came. How unhappy she is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. You could also see the child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The difference between that child and our children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You could see immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, that girl was Mukunda's...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cousin sister. Without husband, woman is very, very unhappy. Therefore according to Vedic system the father has got a very responsible duty to get the daughter married. It is a responsibility of the father. In the absence of father, elder brother. Now the scientists have given them contraceptives. Don't marry and use contraceptive. This is scientific advancement. And the contraceptive user of girls, they're never beautiful. Natural beauty... Natural beauty's lost. Did you mark it? Between a woman having natural children, her beauty's better than the girl using contraceptives. It is natural. As soon as you check natural system, you become in difficulty. The... Still the system is current. <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas,</span> kings, when they are married... You have seen, Kṛṣṇa's father's marriage... So many women also were given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, in charity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because always women population is greater than the man. So those who are kings, they could maintain more than one wife. So not only one wife, another three dozen maid-servants. They are freely mixing with king. They got also children. But they were not, I mean to say, eligible for throne. Only the married wife's son. This is, this was the system. Just like Vidura. Vidura happened to be a son of such maid-servant. So she had, he had no claim on the throne. <span class="Italic">Dāsī-putra.</span> They were called <span class="Italic">dāsī-putras.</span> They were maintained. Just like in royal family, but they have no claim on the throne. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There are two scientists working on how to make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How to make chemicals for contraceptive. One is in Stanford. His name is Carl Geraldsey. And one is in Harvard. His name is Corey, E.J. Corey. They are quite famous now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are very famous now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they gave contraceptives?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. They are trying to make compounds, steroids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sterile. When all the scientists are not famous, notorious. Then this will be called notorious. Somebody has manufactured atomic weapon. Somebody has contraceptive. Somebody has synthetics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> All rogues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists means they must do something mischievous. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Ultimately, they're saying that: "In the future, we'll make tablets, scientists will make tablets, just, taking one or two tablets and they will be satisfied, their hunger." So food will be very simplified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the food value will be taken by him. "Instead of paying to the stores, you pay us. We give you tablet."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're dreaming so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Idle brain is a devils' workshop. Because they have no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their brain is a workshop of the devil. That's all. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. (pause) And without culture men are becoming rogues and thieves, uncultured. Communist movement. Atheistic... Everywhere, nobody's happy. The government's duty, first duty should be that everyone is happy. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> during the time of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Even there was no natural disturbances. No excessive heat, no excessive cold. No anxiety. People are dying now out of anxieties. They're becoming mad, committing suicide, drinking liquors more and more. Just for anxiety. When they cannot solve any big problem, "Bring bottle." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the only solution. (pause) Now <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi.</span> There are nine hundred thousand forms of aquatics. So what the scientist says? How many there are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have no number. They cannot count it. When we say, then they'll say: "How do you know?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our process. You do not know. You admit. That is Vedic knowledge. Everything is there. If you want to know, you have to spend so much money to study how many forms are there. But we believe in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> We get immediately the correct knowledge. Now you cannot challenge it because you do not know. Neither you can know by research work. (pause) <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.</span> The, actually the sea waves, bringing their food. The small fishes or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When a wave comes, they run this way, and when the wave goes down, they run down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the waves bring the food, so immediately they capture. So there is no scarcity of food, even for the small birds. And we are in scarcity. The scientist is manufacturing tablet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're going to convert the wood, the big woods to food also, by treating with the enzymes. That is one of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The wood that grows big, big trees, they say, in a few years, then these will be converted to food by treating with enzymes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there will be no food, natural food. That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> You don't, you'll not get these grains, sugar, milk. This will be stopped. You have to eat woods. Yes. By your advancement of civilization, you have to eat woods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like a termite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) Go home. (Apparently aside) <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> At the moment, scientists are doing so many things. They're having so many hopes. So in about fifty years...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will be so much advancement that there will be no grains, no milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Many scientists and doctors now say you shouldn't drink milk anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say it's unhealthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> What is healthy? Meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do the scientists say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I'm not very sure. But they produce imitation milk, the milk produced from soya bean. That's available in the market. Many, in fact I find, many people do not buy the natural milk. They buy the imitation milk, milk produced from the bean, soya bean. They say that milk contains too much fat. So that makes them very fat. So they want to control their weight by taking the imitation milk which contains less protein and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Milk will disappear. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda, buffalo, buffalo milk is as good as cow's milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It contains more fat. Milk means cow's milk. If you want to derive milk profit, then it is cow's milk. Otherwise every animal has got milk. And next to cow's milk is goat's milk. Goat. Buffalo milk is not so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's difficult to digest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they therefore mix with water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In Manipur we use mostly buffalo milk because cow's milk is not very plenty. Very expensive also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. In India, cows are disappearing by slaughterhouse. (pause) [break] The scientists cannot make drinking water from sea water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. They can make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Very expensive isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. I think in Japan they get water from the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's process. They remove the salt. And they use the water for drinking. But it is quite expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use? If people cannot provide it...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's not free. It's not provided freely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They'll say when the necessity arises, they'll do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In the future. It's going to be a wonderful future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So so long as the future is there, they have something to say. (end of recording)</div>
