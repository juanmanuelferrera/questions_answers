<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To live like them, to dance with them, to dress like them, to smoke like them, to stand like them. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Baḍa?</span> That means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Baḍa sāb. Baḍa sāb-</span>big master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sāheb</span> or <span class="Italic">sāb</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The word is <span class="Italic">sāheb,</span> but short cut, <span class="Italic">sāb.</span> [break] (indistinct) No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, he's show-biz, show-business. (long break)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) This modern civilization. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Don't be hogs. Be human being. This is hog civilization. (Hindi) Sex. Don't care whether he's mother, sister or brother. No, no. This is going on. (long conversation in Hindi with Indians) (new sequence in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> [break] ...that we have to stick to the tradition. <span class="Italic">Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.</span> Then.... Not just by mystical devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no proper guide. They manufacture ideas, that's all. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">,</span> that path is not there. [break] ...name? I forgot</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Gene.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gene.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...building or something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, it's a very big exhibit, scientific achievements. [break] ...come and see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...their achievement, no more death? As soon as you ask this question, <span class="Italic">matte kara heṭ. Baḍo baḍo baḍo badora(?) baro baro pet laṅkā diṅgaya matte karo heṭ.</span> "Big, big monkey, big, big, belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy." What scientific advancement? Do you think there will be no more death? <span class="Italic">Matte kore heṭ:</span> (?)"Yes, we are trying." Answer them, "What is your achievement?" All achievement will be, remain in your back and you'll have to die. So what you have done, insurance, that you'll enjoy this? You'll be kicked out of the scene at any moment. What you have done for this? What is the answer? <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ kore heṭ</span> "Yes, we are trying." (laughter) Nonsense, you are trying. And we have to see this nonsense. We are not so fool. And if they say, "What you are doing?" "Yes, we are doing that. How to conquer over death." <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti, mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is we are trying. That is real scientific. And what is method? Very simple: <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru mām evaiśyasi asaṁśayaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Without any doubt, he comes to Me." This is science. Why shall I waste time? Svarūpa Dāmodara challenged one scientist in California that "If I give you the chemicals, can you manufacture life?" He said, "That I cannot say." What you have spoken all this nonsense? <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ kore heṭ.</span> And when there is challenge, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ kore heṭ.</span> Otherwise, <span class="Italic">baro baro bagara, baro baro phet,</span> big, big monkey, big, big belly. And when the real question is there, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ kore het.</span> Ceylon jumping, melancholy. Hanumān jumped over the ocean, so other monkeys, they also become very proud: "I am..., Hanumān is our leader, we can...," "Can you jump over Ceylon?" <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ het.</span> [break] ...speak all these things, Indian villagers, they will immediately believe. One cobbler.... I think I narrated this story. Nārada Muni was going to Vaikuṇṭha. Did I say that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think this story's in <span class="Italic">Rāja-vidyā,</span> that small book. The one about the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and the cobbler?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. Cobbler immediately believed when he was informed by Nārada Muni that "I saw God is pulling one elephant through the hole of a needle, this side and again this side." The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> did not believe it. And as soon as the cobbler, he was also devotee, oh, he began to pray, "Oh, my Lord can do anything." Nārada Muni, "You believed it?" "Yes, why not?" "How do you believe it?" "I am daily seeing. I am underneath the tree, and so many figs are dropping, and each fig has got thousands of seeds, and in each seed there is another tree. Why should I not believe it?" He did not believe it blindly. With reason, and he gave immediately reason: "When I see this fig tree, big fig tree, and there are millions of figs dropping, and in each fig there are millions of seeds, and each seed there is.... Why shall I not believe it?" God, nothing is impossible by God, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> was supposed to be learned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. And he said, "These are all...," what is called? Mythology. Why mythology? Why do you think God like you? God is all-powerful; He can do anything. That is real faith. That means you have no faith. "If God can do which tallies with my activities, then I shall believe." What you are? Nonsense. This is their general argument. How we can believe this? And why not believe this? You are seeing so many wonderful things. I gave this example to another man, that there is a coconut tree. Now find out where is the pipe and pumping so that the water is pushed. Show me. You have no idea that such a high height, how water is going there. And full of water. How the water is transferred there? Show me the pipe and pump. You have got the idea, that with pipe and pump we can raise the water. Where is that pipe and pump? Show me. Every day, every moment, we are seeing so many wonderful things. How you are thinking.... "I am Dr. Frog. Pacific Ocean may be four feet. All right, five feet. Make compromise, ten feet." (laughter) Rascal. If you think for many millions of years, then you'll have no solution. <span class="Italic">Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo</span> [Bs. 5.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is not possible in that way. They have no idea of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everything is there, but actually they don't see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are not devotee. <span class="Italic">Paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣā. Mām ebhyaḥ param, mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ parama-avyayam. Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ. Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ.</span> They have no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They think that if they follow, they'll still be misled. "Why should I believe? It may not be true."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are already misled. Why not be second time misled? You are already misled, thousand times. Why not try once more. You are making so much arrangement to live comfortably, but you are kicked out. Are you not misled? <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> You are thinking that by adjustment of this external energy, you will be able to live very happily. Is it possible? You are trying, problem after problem, problem after problem. So you are already misled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You've said, "Just give this one life to Kṛṣṇa. You've misgambled so many lives. Why not give one to Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are misled already so many lives. All right, be misled another life. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're taking a photo today for the BTG, so they'd like if you would pose for five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? (end)</div>
