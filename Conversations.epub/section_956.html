<div class="Heading">Interview with Newsday Newspaper<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 14, 1976, New York</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him chair. They... Give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These gentlemen are a reporter and a photographer from a very large newspaper in Long Island called Newsday. This is Mr. Kevin Layhart...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they require chair?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's asking if you'd like a chair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> No, this is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is Mr. Bill Semm. He's a photographer from their newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. Sit down. You have seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, I have. You translated all of those. (pause) [break] ...I wonder if you could tell me how you came to founding the movement here in the United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was ordered by my spiritual master to do this work, so on his order I came in 1965. That is the beginning of this. I came alone with no help, no money. Somehow or other (laughs) I started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer: :</span>How did you attract people? You landed in New York...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My attraction is this chanting. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Did you stand on street corners and chant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I had no magic. Just like others. They say some..., show some magic. I never showed any magic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> No, I understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Thompkins Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By Thompkins Park I was chanting, and these boys gradually came. First picture was published by the New York Times. Then we started branches in San Francisco, in Montreal, Boston. And then Los Angeles. In this way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So you just chanted in Thompkins Park, and people came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I was underneath a tree. I think that picture was published by that Voice, very big article, published.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What did you have to offer then. If you were chanting in the park and I said "What are you doing? Why are you chanting? What's your thing here?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He said what did you have to offer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He said, "If someone had come up to you while you were chanting and said, 'Why are you doing this? What are you offering?' How would you have replied."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They came... Naturally they came and joined me and began to dance, that's all. That is the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But what if they asked you, "What is this all about?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is for spiritual realization. If you chant, then, gradually, you realize yourself that you are a spiritual being; you are not this body. Then his spiritual life begins. Actually human life is meant for spiritual realization, and if one does not spiritually realize his identity, then he remains an animal. That is the difference between animal and man. Man is supposed to be spiritually realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How is that spiritual dimension realized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One has to realize that he's not this body, he's spirit soul, and the spirit soul is within the body, and after annihilation of this body, the spirit soul is transferred to another body. So there are 8,400,000 different forms of life. And we have to transmigrate to any one of these forms. So today I am in American body or Indian body, very comfortably situated, but at the time of death my particular mentality will transfer me to a particular type of body. Exactly like if a man infects some contagious disease he has to develop that disease. It is very subtle material laws. So similarly, we are composed of gross body and subtle body. The gross body is made of this earth, water, air, fire, ether, like this. And the subtle body is made of mind, intelligence and ego. And the spirit soul is within that outward gross and subtle bodies. When the gross body is annihilated, the subtle body, mind, carries the soul to a similar body as he was thinking at the time of death. It is, example is given... Just like the flavor of a rose garden is carried by the air or the bad odor of a filthy place is also carried by the air, similarly, mind, intelligence carries me to a particular type of body as I was absorbed in thought at the time of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What is the ultimate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ultimate is that you are spirit soul, you are being materially engrossed, you are creating different situations and you are being transferred to different bodies. That is different situations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But for what purpose and to what end? What's the final end?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so final, that unless you are spiritually realized, you do not know what is the final end. The final end is that we are part and parcel of God. Somehow or other we are in contact with this material atmosphere. So our final aim is to go back to home, back to Godhead. Unless we know this and we practice how to return back again to Godhead, then we have to remain within this material world, transmigrating from one body to another. Therefore the human intelligence is meant for understanding the spiritual identity and the goal of life and act accordingly. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is an educational movement to enlighten the people from gross ignorance to the highest enlightenment of spiritual understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is it an internal educational process or external?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is internal but externally... Just like externally, behavior makes internal inclinations. If you associate with some bad company, the internally also you develop bad propensities. And if you associate with good company, then internally you develop good propensities. So internally, externally, they are interrelated. By external behavior we influence our internal energy. And by internal atmosphere we get the external body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I'm trying to find out whether the consciousness lies within us, brought out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, consciousness... Consciousness will be... Because... Just like sunshine and the sun. Similarly, the soul means consciousness. It is just like sunshine. The soul is very small particle, but it is shining as consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So we can allow it to fulfill itself or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He wants to know, is this consciousness within us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So long the soul is there, the consciousness is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Kṛṣṇa cons..., immediately Kṛṣṇa conscious. Consciousness is there. Just like so long the soul is there, you pinch any part of your body-you'll feel pain. That is consciousness. And when the soul is gone out of the body, If you cut the hand, there will be no consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Did you mean to ask whether the ultimate state of consciousness is within us that has to be brought out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, consciousness is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He meant the dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is original consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that is within us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And it needs to be brought out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And how is that brought out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is brought out by this process. You have to go under some process. Just like a man can be made unconscious and again conscious under some process. If you... What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Anesthesia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anesthetic, he becomes unconscious. Then, another process, we can bring him to conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> All right, let me ask a rather long question. Let's assume that all human beings have an innate ability to speak, and depending upon the circumstances they find themselves in when they are very small, they will learn Sanskrit, they will learn English, they will learn French, they will learn Chinese. What... Now, if I were Chinese, I would say, "Well Chinese is the best language." I would have a, you know... I could take a different mode on what's the best way to communicate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Chinese...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now, in terms of your movement, you're bringing out consciousness, which I would analogize...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> To the ability to speak. Now, how is your path or your way different from (or) better than others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but there is no question of "better than others." It is the only thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> It is the only way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only thing. It is not the question of better or superior. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness means God consciousness. So either you are Chinese or English or American, there is consciousness. When that consciousness is purified, that is God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes. But is your way the only way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is only way. Because God is one and God consciousness is one, so when you are Chinese consciousness, that is foreign. Or either American consciousness, it is foreign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Okay, I was speaking in an analogical way. There are different way to express oneself or different languages one can learn. Similarly, I would think there would be different ways to get to consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different ways may be, but if you actually come to that consciousness, that different way is approved. Otherwise it is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span>. Other way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You judge by the results.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you come to God consciousness, either through the Christian process or Chinese process or Indian process, it doesn't matter. But if you do not come to God consciousness, then it is all bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But you can come to God consciousness through a variety of paths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's saying that. He's saying "if."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says, "But you can come to God consciousness by different processes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, different processes... Our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not that. The aim is to come to the God consciousness. And the means may be different. So that means is justified by the end. If at the end, you do not come to God consciousness, then whatever process you have, that is bogus. That is not bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You say it works?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it works, it is bona fide. If it does not work, then it is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And to your mind is it possible to come to God consciousness through other means than yours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I say if it is possible, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if it is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is it, though? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That you have to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, thing is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That you have to see. You have to judge whether you are going to get that result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. People... Whether he is coming to God consciousness or dog consciousness, two things are there. Consciousness means when he understands that "I am part and parcel of God. I am servant of God." Then it is all right. But if he is thinking that "I am servant of dog," then it is not proper way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Your movement has been criticized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, how it is criticized? How it is criticized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> People have said that it works against the family, it works against Western society, that you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, here is a family man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is a family man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I'm sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Here is a family man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is a family man. How you say it is against family? There are so many families here, children. You have seen our class in the morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> No, I have not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All family members, children, husband, wife, they are present there. How do you say it is against family? Wrong criticism. This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Are your followers encouraged to visit with their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all you take your answer one by one. You say, "against the family." It is a wrong. It is a wrong propaganda. Oh, there are so many families in our society. It is a society. There are family members. There are <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> There are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">vānaprastha.</span> Whatever situation is suitable for you, you can accept, and in any situation, you can become God conscious. That's a wrong propaganda, that we are against family. Here is a wife of a boy. They have family. There are so many families. Why do you say like that, "We are against family? It's a wrong. You should note it especially that this type of criticism is envious. It is not proper. We invite all families, children, husband, wife, "Come on. Take Kṛṣṇa consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I've been accosted at airports, on streets, places like that by devotees, and I've been told that you operate drug centers and a number of other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drug centers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He means we're curing people. Places where people will become cured from the bad habit of taking drugs. That's a drug center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But our people are all free from all that drug disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He is saying that he has simply met devotees at airports and other places where they approach him to maybe ask for some contribution, to see if he's interested, and they say that they are representing some drug center, something like that. So what's the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, and they think how to sell literature and... Is that the way to God consciousness, by selling and soliciting? Is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How does that fit in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are God conscious, naturally you give up all intoxication habit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yeah, but just going out and selling and accosting people on the street...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's asking how does our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> activities relate to God consciousness, the selling of books and collecting of donations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if I sell a book to you, you read because you have paid for. Then you'll get benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How does it benefit the seller?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How does it benefit the person who works on the selling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless you purchase, how you'll get reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> How does it benefit the person who is selling the book, the devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> How is he benefited by selling books to others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he... He is giving service to Kṛṣṇa. He's not charging anything. If we appoint some bookseller, you have to pay, but we haven't got to pay. Out of his love for Kṛṣṇa he's doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> See, our men who distribute these books, they do not receive salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It's like welfare work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the sign of love. That is in material field also. There are so many philosophers, scientists and artists, they have done out of love for their subject matter, not for payment. That is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But aren't they also purified spiritually by doing this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This spiritual realization means the more you give service to God, you become spiritually profited, in any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What are some of the other, aside from...? I mean, I see people selling things. What other practices are involved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you stay one day, whole day and night, and see practically, from morning four o'clock to night ten o'clock, how we are engaged in different practices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You rise at four?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Three-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In this temple three, three-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Chant, study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You go any room of this house. You'll find simply Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Preparing for the morning services.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can describe, the whole day's program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What's the purpose of that rising? What's the purpose of that, the rising at 4:30, the chanting and study?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It means to be fixed up in (indistinct) spiritual life. Just like in military there is training. You must have to do at this time this thing, this time, this time... So any training means regulated life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What is the most important part of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The most important part is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, what's the most important practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practice, yes. This is practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Which devotional practice...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He is asking whether one technique is more important than another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is important. Everything is important. You cannot say, "This is most important; this is less important." Everything is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But suppose someone cannot live in our temple. Then we may recommend to him at least chant Hare Kṛṣṇa in your home...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and read the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And follow the regulative principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And follow as far as possible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Refrain from sinful life. What are the sinful life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating, and no intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We find that these activities disturb the body and the mind. They are not compatible or conducive for spiritual practices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a diseased man. If he wants to be cured, there are something, prohibition, "Don't do this. Don't eat this." So it is also curing the diseased mind and to bring him in the spiritual platform. So there are something "Do's," something "do not." That's all. That is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You came here ten years ago, or eleven years ago. You were almost seventy at the time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes, actually I came here at the age of seventy years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What had you been doing previously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Previously? I was family man. I retired in 1954. My Guru Mahārāja asked me to take this task seriously when I was twenty-five years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Who asked you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-five years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I was at that time family man, so I thought, "Let me adjust my family affairs. Then I shall take it." So by doing the adjustment it took me long years. So I retired at the age of fifty-eight. Then I took up seriously. And when I was seventy years old, then I came here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Were you a businessman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I was connected with some chemical industry. I was manager in a big chemical industry. Then I started my own business. In this way I was family man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But at the same time, Śrīla Prabhupāda was always Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> And He was writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And also he was writing transcendental or spiritual books even at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> 1944.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's not that he has adopted a new occupation now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He has always been Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> was started in 1944, when I was still a family man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You started that in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India. The first copy is here, some copy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The first copy is in the Library of Congress in Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Your family, your blood family, are they Kṛṣṇa conscious as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very much. Therefore I had to leave them and create another family. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How many children do you have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got two daughters and two sons. My wife is also still living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is she Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very much. Naturally women are after worldly opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Was it difficult for you to give up what you had been doing in order to devote full time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is the Vedic system that at a certain age they should give up family connection and completely devote for God consciousness. In the beginning, twenty-five years, he should learn from guru about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then, if he is able, he does not become a family man, but if he is unable or circumstantially, he may become a family man. So he can remain a family man up to fiftieth year and then he retires from family life. He travels in holy places with his wife, and sometimes he comes home and sometimes he goes home. In this way, when he's practiced to give up family attachment, then the wife goes back home to the care of her elderly children, and the man takes <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> and he remains alone simply for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is Vedic system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Vedic system means very traditional, from ancient India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes. Now, you are not practicing the Vedic system, then, here, are you? Or are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is all Vedic system. It is Vedic system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is it better to do it the way you did it or to start from a very early age in the, er...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In other words, some of our members are <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> at an earlier age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if... The purpose is to train a person in <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> not to enter into the entanglement of this material life. That is Vedic system. Basic principle is that don't be entangled with this material energy. So at the early age, up to twenty-five, he's trained up. If he can, he can continue as <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> He directly can take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> But if he's unable, so let him go by step by step. Let him become a family, householder life, then retired life, then... But <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> at the end, that is compulsory, not that unless he is shot down by somebody, he's not going to give up family life. That is not Vedic system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But young men don't tend to be wise, do they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Young men do not generally possess a great deal of wisdom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if he's trained up. Just like here we have got so many young men. They are trained up. So there is no prohibition that a young man cannot become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> If he's able, he can take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> from the very beginning. But if he's not able, let him enter into household life and then remain as householder up to fiftieth year, then retire, then take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> It is not an enforcement. A gradual process. But the ultimate end is to become free from all material attachment and completely devote life for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the ultimate end. Because human life is meant for that purpose, self-realization or spiritual realization, that opportunity must be given to all human beings. Unfortunately at the present moment the civilization has no scope for spiritual realization. They live like other animals, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. That's all. They do not know there is another life, spiritual life, and neither there is any education or institution to educate them. Now we are trying for that purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How important is it to look after physical life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Physical life, so you must keep yourself fit to execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not our desire that you become sick and you cannot chant. But our purpose is to chant and we require the physical necessities just to keep ourselves fit, not more than that. Eating is necessary. Without eating, I will die. So we take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> not in the restaurant or hotel anything, no. We take nice vegetables, nice food grains, rice, wheat, sugar, milk, all vitaminous, full of vitamins. So there is no deficiency of food. Even from food value it is very nice. We do not unnecessarily kill animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You run farms as well, do you not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What do they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Are they working farms, producing farms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are many farms in your country. Just now I am coming from New Vrindāban in West Virginia. They are living. If you go sometime, you can see how independently they are living. And there are other farms, New Orleans, and just now we are going tomorrow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Pennsylvania.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pennsylvania. So we get enough milk, enough food grains, enough fruits. So there is no economic problem. Our purpose is to save time from unnecessary necessities of life, from unnecessary necessities of life, to save time and utilize the time for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And so far the body is concerned, as much as it is required take and maintain the body. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Your devotees' health is looked after, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> By who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are instructed in that way, plain living, high thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Do you have arrangements with hospitals in case somebody gets sick, and do you watch diet carefully and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Why not? Why not? Take care of the body. But we keep our habits in such a way that we don't fall sick very often.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You said before that with respect to achieving Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that the end was most important, that becoming God conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...Was the most important thing. Would that ever allow you to or any one of the devotees, to engage in practices that would be considered unjust or criminal in a broader society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In terms of, you know, "This is for Kṛṣṇa. This is for developing God consciousness..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you are interested in Kṛṣṇa, you are interested for everyone. And if you are interested for a particular person, society, then you are not interested in Kṛṣṇa. The example I can give you. Just like if you supply food to your stomach, then you supply food to your eyes, ears, hands, legs, everything. But if you supply food to your eyes, then you become blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He wants to know that would you be justified in doing something that society would consider criminal, like, say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Like stealing for Kṛṣṇa, or killing for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If it is... Something that is judged by, say, the US government as criminal, would be still do it if it was for Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we do not do anything which is harmful to the society. We do not do anything, not only to the human society. To the animal society, to the tree society, to the aquatic society, we do not do anything. We do not support the slaughterhouse, killing the animals. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to see every living entity on the same level. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are not cruel to anyone. Either he's a man or animal or tree or bird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Does that take on a positive aspect as well so that by not only do I not kill animals and I don't kill men, do I, am I obliged under your system, am I obliged to actively help...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, suppose if you are coming to kill me, then I must take advantage of killing you first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I understand that, and obliged to go beyond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Are you also obliged to help animals, to help other human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are maintaining animals, giving them food, giving them security of life in all our farms the animals are very free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We're obliged because they are all part and parcel of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And what about with people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every people. You come to stay with us, we give you all help. Anyone who comes to our society we give shelter, we give food, we give instruction, we give dress, everything. Without any condition. You please come and live with us. For such a nice building we have taken. Our farms are so nice, you can go and see how they are doing. We have got one hundred and two centers all over the world. You'll find they are living very comfortably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How many centers in the United States?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About forty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Forty or fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Fifty with the farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How are those supported? Do they support themselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I beg your pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> The way they support themselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa supports.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Kṛṣṇa supports?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We do not know what we shall eat tomorrow, but we have no insufficiency. Rather, neighbors they are grudging that these people do not do anything and they live so comfortably. Sometimes they ask...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How does Kṛṣṇa support them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> He mediates through physical things, does he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is within you. So if Kṛṣṇa dictates, "Give him three thousand dollars," you'll give me. That's all. That actually it is fact. Yesterday Mr. Coleman came? He gave me a check for three thousand. I never asked him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Who? Mr. Coleman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Coleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are immediately depositing for our Vṛndāvana and Māyāpura scheme. So Kṛṣṇa sends money. We do not bother what will happen tomorrow. But we are very nicely maintained by Kṛṣṇa's grace. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Verse">ananyāś cintayanto māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>ye janāḥ paryupāsate<br class="calibre2"/>teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.22]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> A question: you are now the leader and the spiritual master. Who will take your place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Kṛṣṇa will dictate who will take my place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Kṛṣṇa will tell you that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want that verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the translation of what the Sanskrit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can read the Sanskrit also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form-to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> They still have to go out and ask occasionally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It's not that we sit back and wait for Kṛṣṇa to send it to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, we're very industrious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't sit down idly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> God helps those who help themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not idle preachers, we are working. All, very hard, more than the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These men, they go out to engage people in taking our books maybe twelve hours a day sometimes, ten hours a day, without any salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am now eighty years old, I am working twenty-four hours. I think I work more than my young disciples (laughter).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Oh yes, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I work at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is hard to keep up with Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not idle creatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are publishing his books and sometimes he is ahead of us by seventeen volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How do you spend your days? You do an awful lot of traveling I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Traveling is going on throughout the whole world and wherever I go, at night I write books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Translates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translate. And daytime I meet devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You arrange the marriages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have to ask me, final decision is taken from me. From all over the world, from all over the world letters are coming some problem, some problem, some problem. Although I have got about twenty secretaries, still they have to consult, I have to give them advice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In the evening Śrīla Prabhupāda goes to bed at ten o'clock and gets up at eleven-thirty to begin translating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You just sleep a couple of hours, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, one and a half hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That's it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Of course in daytime I take rest two hours. So in this way altogether about three to four hours. Our philosophy is not that you sit idly and God will send everything, no, not like that. We know God will send everything, still we work. Without God's sanction nothing can come. But we must be qualified to receive the favor of God. That is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Are you surprised at the way this organization has prospered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Are we surprised at the way the movement has expanded and prospered in just a few short years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not surprising, it is natural. If you do, just like if you do business in proper way there will be profit. Similarly, as it is enjoined in this book of knowledge, if you do like that it will expand, it will prosper. Two plus two equal to four. Mathematical calculation. If you make two plus two, it will become four. It will neither become three nor five. So here it is said, you have read the, that "One who is engaged twenty-four hours in My service, so I, <span class="Italic">yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham [Bg. </span>9.22]<span class="Italic">,</span> I supply whatever he requires and I protect whatever he has got." So if you actually serve Kṛṣṇa, then everything you want, it will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Do you have any questions about our festival coming up this Sunday? You know we're marching down Fifth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Are you going to march?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He asks if you are going to participate in the <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā</span> Parade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the parade that it's based on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a photograph of what takes place in India every year. It's a traditional festival in India, we are bringing it to New York. We've got our permits and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have already got in San Francisco, in Chicago...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Philadelphia.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Paris we're beginning also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> First year Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is our festivals that we've begun in the West based on the one on the front there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take that book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You are participating in it, are you not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somewhere when I have opportunity I participate, otherwise they do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In other words, Prabhupāda doesn't attend every festival all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Will you attend the one here in New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How do you choose, you are responsible for the organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Are you the one who chooses who runs each center, who is responsible in each temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our program is to open centers in every village, every town, to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And you choose the leaders, or Kṛṣṇa does and tells you, how does that work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have been chosen by my spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes. And you in turn choose others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. That is our succession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> On what basis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Basis, on the order of Kṛṣṇa. Originally the order is from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How does that come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Comes by disciplic succession. Just like Kṛṣṇa said this knowledge to Arjuna and Arjuna said to others and it is open. Everyone can take it, there is no secrecy. We have to accept only, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I missed that, I'm sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The order is already there, it is open, open secret. There is no secrecy. Anyone can take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> All right. But in terms of specific, say, choosing, specific things, specific details.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in all details, how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is all details in this book, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So he's asking what's a man's qualification to be chosen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In other words Prabhupāda will decide who should be leader if he's qualified and there's a process for making him qualified and there's a process for testing to see if he is qualified. So in that way it all comes from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You chose, for example, these fellows here to run the publishing house and be responsible for the east coast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, like that. He's in charge of publication, he's in charge something else, he's charge, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> On what basis, though, can you tell me some of the things that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Basis, just to see whether he's qualified, that's all. Just like ordinarily one manager is appointed by the superior authority on the merit, on his qualification. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Okay, is it a mediated choice or is it a direct communication from Kṛṣṇa, that's my question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's asking whether we claim that God speaks to us directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, God speaks to you when you are qualified. You cannot expect God as order supplier. When he sees that you are qualified, he will speak to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The spiritual master is the representative of God to the disciple because he is in direct contact with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My spiritual master appointed me that "You do this." Similarly I shall appoint somebody else, this is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's difficult for people to understand that God can speak to a man. They question, "How can God speak to some man?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, anything, that, the radio message is coming, a foolish man cannot understand how it is coming. He'll think "How it is that, speaking?" So any foolish man will be astonished how things are happening. That is foolishness. But God says, find out this verse...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Four three? <span class="Italic">Sa evāyaṁ mayā te 'dya</span> [Bg. 4.3]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No no. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti te.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give them the understanding by which they can come to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is situated in everyone's heart. As soon as He sees that "Here is a qualified person," then He gives him instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But in the same way that Kṛṣṇa says He'll provide for your needs you still must work to achieve whatever Kṛṣṇa is giving you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You work for Kṛṣṇa. You have to work to get your necessities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In the same way I'm curious with respect to the way Kṛṣṇa communicates with you, whether it's in a similar kind of way that He gives you your necessities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In other words, when you decide that someone is to be in charge of a particular temple does Kṛṣṇa tell you that this person should be in charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Or do you by judging him say this person is qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because a devotee always consults Kṛṣṇa and He gives order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> It's a more direct communication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And He gives order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because intelligence, our philosophy is that intelligence comes from Kṛṣṇa. So if I have some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And your philosophy is that your daily necessities come from Kṛṣṇa as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, try to understand. Suppose my intelligence sees that this person is qualified, that means Kṛṣṇa has told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not necessarily, Kṛṣṇa will tell directly. A devotee always consults Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa tells him, "Do like this." Not figuratively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Does that apply then to other kinds of decisions and other kinds of activities as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. Because a devotee does not do anything without consulting Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But that applies to a very greatly elevated soul, that is not an ordinary person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, therefore the minor devotees, they consult the spiritual master. That is our process. <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I see, I was trying to explain the minor devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> No, I was talking about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You're talking about the topmost level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's getting right to the source.(laughter) Right to the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That will do it for me, I thank you, kindly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We were going to take care of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...<span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you for your coming. Take this flower. (end)</div>
