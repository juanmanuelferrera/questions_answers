<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> There is a book, perhaps you might have read, <i class="calibre3">Aquarian Gospel.</i> So in that book I have read there is a Greek word, <i class="calibre3">Christo. Christo</i>... Sometimes we don't say <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa,</i> we say <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṭa</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b><i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṭa</i>, yes, in Bengali particularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. So this <i class="calibre3">Christo</i> word means "anointed." Kṛṣṇa's face is anointed. And love also. And this Christ title was given to Jesus on account of his love for God. So on the whole, the conclusion is <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa</i> or <i class="calibre3">Christo</i> means "love of Godhead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>No,<b class="calibre4"> </b>Mandakara(?) has tried to argue that the entire Kṛṣṇa religion of <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata</i> has been borrowed from the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> How is this possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā: </b>How does he do that chronologically? How is that possible? It's impossible to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>There was some exchange, some people came from Greece here, and just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> But the Greek civilization was not developed five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> It wasn't even developed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>But he doesn't take it so back as five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> So anybody can say anything. (guest laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Our authorities, they accept Mandakara(?) is not as good as Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Śaṅkarācārya. We... Nobody can give credit to Mandakara more than these <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i> or Caitanya. So how his proposition can be accepted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>So he was knighted, you see, by the British government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, just see. (guest laughs) Just like Nehru bribed one Mukerjee, Rādhā-kuṇḍa Mukerjee, doctor, to write book where he has supported cow slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>He supported. Hmm, hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> If I was the Western government and you handed the most perfect knowledge to me, I would knight you also, in the name of myself. Certainly I would knight you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So Rādhā-kuṇḍa Mukerjee, he has supported cow slaughter. He was given a post, made a parliament member first of all. So this poor man, five hundred rupees per month, he accepted. Then he induced that "You take more money, write like this." So if you pay money... British government's whole policy was that if the Indians are kept strict Hindus, it is next to impossible to govern them. So therefore they adopted this policy. They changed the whole policy how the Hindu will think everything mentioned in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> is nonsense. They have trained up, and Nehru is the first-class trainee. Everything mentioned in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra,</i> the Arya-samaj, they also wrote <i class="calibre3">Saptartha</i> (indistinct), so many. And Dr. Radhakrishnan also. All the scholars, they would never mention any <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> more than once within one thousand years. That means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>Otherwise they would not be scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Otherwise they will not be scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> At any rate, where it came from is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Because according to Darwin's theory, your forefather was monkey. So their theory is that long before there were monkeys only. How such high philosophical thoughts could come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>It is true that in England there were only monkeys there. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> On this theory, all their philosophy is going on. So if they give credit that Indians were so high scholars and philosophers, then the whole theory is spoiled. Because brain is developing, and the background of brain was monkey. So how such philosophical highly moral scholarly work can be done? And this is going on. If <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> is accepted as we accept that five thousand years ago it was written, then their whole civilization becomes topsy-turvy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>About the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> also he says that there is the mention of Buddha in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> and many descendants of Buddha who lived...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The Buddhists, they don't accept that verse. <i class="calibre3">Kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati</i>,<i class="calibre3"> buddho nāmnāñjana-sutaḥ</i>. They do not accept. About Buddha, in Hindu literature, Vedic literature, there is mention, <i class="calibre3">bhaviśyati,</i> feature(?). That is insult to them. Therefore, they do not accept this verse. Neither we say Buddha is incarnation of God. <i class="calibre3">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra.</i> They do not accept this. They think it is insult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>Insulting them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, Hindu gods... But in one Buddha temple, I have seen in Penang, there is Viṣṇu-<i class="calibre3">mūrti</i>. Yes, four hundred years old. That is a Buddhist temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Dr. Chandra has found many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Dr. Chandra has found many Viṣṇu-<i class="calibre3">mūrtis</i> in Buddhist temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Especially in Malaysia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Malaysia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Especially in Malaysia, so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Malaysia, I speak of Malaysia, Penang is in Malaysia. Dr. Chandra (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So they worship Viṣṇu. And Buddha...Buddha-<i class="calibre3">dharma</i> is an offshoot of the Vedic religion. That is the proof, they worship Viṣṇu. <i class="calibre3">Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> But to this man, he says that's the proof that Vaiṣṇava is an offshoot of Buddhism, that Viṣṇu is in the Buddhist temple. He can say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> This Caitanya who has written this book can say that since Viṣṇu is in the Buddhist temple that this proves that Viṣṇu is an offshoot of Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, he can say like that. But the offshoot he cannot say. Viṣṇu is long, long ago mentioned, Buddha is later. Buddha can be from Viṣṇu, but Viṣṇu cannot be from Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> So how do they speak of that chronologically? They don't accept that<i class="calibre3"> Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> as five thousand years old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor: </b>No. [break] This bundle...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> No, those are documents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Documents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b>  Yeah, photocopies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> You promised to give me a photo of Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> I'll give you one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you have got any colored photo, you can give him. So we have now increased eighty-seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> More, ninety-two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ninety-two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Ah, you don't know yourself. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, actually Kapoorji, I do not know how things are going like this. I tell you frankly. I have no credit. But things are going on like this. It is something like-of course, I am not comparing exactly-just like Kṛṣṇa could not understand about His potency and, therefore He became Rādhārāṇī's feature to understand Himself. So... Of course, I... This is a comparison. Things are taking very wonderfully. Very wonderfully. Just see these boys and girls, how seriously they have taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Oh, yes, there is no doubt about their earnestness, and people have...This is just what strikes people. How can these people be so sincere and so earnest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So I simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> They are beating Indians. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I simply advise them that you regularly chant the sixteen rounds. Not more, you cannot make... You cannot imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. But there must be one <i class="calibre3">saṅkhyā</i>. <i class="calibre3">Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna.</i> They are observing that and the regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling. And they are following other instructions, so they are wonderfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> You know Dalmiaji's daughter-in-law, the wife of Viṣṇu Hari Dalmia...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Viṣṇu Hari went to see me in London, perhaps with his wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> <i class="calibre3">Accha</i>. She told me, she said the movement is all right but they are so strict, such strict rules and regulations are being imposed upon these people, how long will they be able to follow them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is a surprise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> This is bound to fail, she said. I say it will succeed just because of this. (laughter) The rules and regulations imposed upon them are like strong fences put around them to keep <i class="calibre3">māyā</i> away, you see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā: </b>They want relgiosity watered down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Actually, because they are following strictly, <i class="calibre3">māyā </i>cannot touch them. <i class="calibre3">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ,</i> <i class="calibre3">na sa siddhim</i> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]. Kṛṣṇa says <i class="calibre3">vidhi. Bhakti-vidhi. </i>Must be followed. (aside:) This is cut piece? Cut piece from the book cover? No. It is original photo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b>  A copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> It is fine. [break] (laughs) But now I changed so there is a Radha-Kṛṣṇa photo in the background which is cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You can give some of that. It is not very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> We need the nice ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> We don't have any others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> We didn't bring so many things with us, but we'll give him very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Here Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa photo is cut, it's not good. You have got any in your photo...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Not color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> May not be color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Give me afterwards, there is no hurry. And what about those photos you took in town that day? That lady inquires from me every time I go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Mahāprabhu's photo, Maha(indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b>  Kṣīrodakaśāyī has those negatives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b>  I think Kṣīrodakaśāyī has those negatives. I'll inquire. Kṣīrodakaśāyī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> He has?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b>  He has those negatives. I'll inquire where they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> If you give me the negatives, I will get them developed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> You want to take massage now, Srila Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So give some <i class="calibre3">prasādam.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> You are observing Ekādaśī today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Ekādaśī today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ekādaśī<i class="calibre3">?</i> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> So you are going for that piece of land, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Garden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. You like that piece of land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> I like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, it is nice. Two sides...three sides road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Three sides road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Three sides road, and good locality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> This one is all right, of course. This land that you have purchased is very well suited. But that orchard, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Orchard, yes. That you can inquire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> If you want to expand afterwards...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> ...this piece of land may not be sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> And that may not be available afterwards. So if you can go in for it just now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. So what actually he wants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> (indistinct) must have told you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> He mentioned that he thought sixty thousand, but he was not positive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> He was not sure, but they both said sixty thousand, but they were not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> (laughs) Since both of us say sixty thousand, I think you can get in touch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> But that is very nice plot. And it is about two times as large as Mr. Dalmia's land, and Mr. Dalmia was asking fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> No, he has purchased it for fifty thousand. Sixty thousand is his entire cost, including expenses and everything. I asked him, he told me. Sixty thousand. So from that point, that land is cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> You have more extensive buildings on it than Dalmia's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> What about the adjoining land, it is also available?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> There is some adjoining land behind...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Adjoining which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> That sixty thousand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Bon Maharaja bought this land very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Oh, yes. He got it for nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Only thirty thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> No, even less, I think. About ten thousand. But he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He had to spend much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> He got it... It was requisitioned for the college, you see. It was requisitioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Vṛndāvana University, Vaiṣṇava (indistinct). It was acquired by the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Acquired by the government. That's how he got it cheap. And then he had to go into litigation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, yes. Much litigation, and he was in danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> He was in danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Still it's not finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not yet finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Not yet finished? That litigation is still going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> No, I mean the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Building huh. The construction is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now he is getting money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Now he is getting money. The institution has been recognized by the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He is not here. I inquired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Perhaps not. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He's gone to Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> He was trying to force me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Bombay, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> ...force the professorship of his college upon me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> When I came here after my retirement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, yes. I know that. [break] If you want, you can come sometime to European countries to our different branches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Why you make me leave Vṛndāvana now? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, because you have got some background, so you can have very good chance to speak in big institution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And if our movement is supported in that way, that will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> I was out from Vṛndāvana for about a month-and-a-half, that I told you. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That was also painful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> (indistinct) hell. Although I was with my children, you see, small kiddies, lovely people, you see. And still, you see, I didn't like to stay with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That I can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> I came away. And as I was coming to Vṛndāvana, you see, I think it was by way of punishment, you see, for being..., for remaining outside Vṛndāvana for such a long period that the strange thing happened, you see. And Rādhārāṇī made me undergo a <i class="calibre3">prāyaścitta</i> before I came back. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> A what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> You see, what happened was, it was the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Prāyaścitta.</i> Intonation, what do you call?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Prāyaścitta,</i> what is the exact English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Penance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b>  Atonement.</div>
