<div class="Heading">Conversation After Interview with<br class="calibre2"/>Religious Editor, Associated Press<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 16, 1976, New York</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are accustomed to the business of hammering the bricks from time immemorial, they think "This is the business. How is that this man is not engaged in this business?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even after he'd understood the analogy that the man was in the prison and hammering bricks, he was still thinking that "Well, shouldn't he still be hammering bricks?" He was asking that. He was still thinking like that. It's amazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He couldn't understand any of the analogies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> Even the Orissa politicians, they accused Caitanya Mahāprabhu, because the Orissa politician, it is a fact the Mahārāja Pratāparudra, the King of Orissa during the time of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was politically very strong. At that time the Muhammadans were conquering different parts of India, but they could not enter Orissa or the southern India. They were very strong. So this Mahārāja Pratāparudra politically was very strong. So the modern politicians of Orissa, they accuse Caitanya Mahāprabhu that, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to Orissa and Mahārāja Pratāparudra became influenced by Him, Orissa fell down. They accuse sometimes that Orissa's political position became weakened on account of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's influence on Mahārāja Pratāparudra. They say. The modern politicians of Orissa, they also do not like Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? There's this editor from that <span class="Italic">Trans-India</span> magazine downstairs, but also that..., the doctor is there as well. So would you like to see the doctor, or would you like to do another interview? They tried to..., they were trying to contact the <span class="Italic">Trans-India</span> to have him come another day, but apparently it doesn't seem as though they did it. So they've come hoping to get an interview.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that you decide, which is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, I... We'll see if we can arrange it. Would you like to see the doctor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, the <span class="Italic">Trans-India</span> if he wants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can wait or one of them may come. So what is the news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> decided they want to have a meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that GBC meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, no. My <span class="Italic">karmī</span> friends, on the 19th in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They always decide on perfect timing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. I shall prefer to see the <span class="Italic">Trans-India</span> first, because they will give some publicity to our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So we'll tell the doctor to please wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All right, he has gone to where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He may bring the doctor up first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, let him come. So who is the chief man dealing with this, who is the chief secretary, all these visitors?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Bali-mardana has been greeting them, because Rāmeśvara is involved in the GBC meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have been in the GBC meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, I was earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the subject matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We discussed Jagadīśa Prabhu's request to primarily attend his engagement with <span class="Italic">Gurukula,</span> and we also discussed Satsvarūpa Gosvāmī's desire to attend primarily Library Party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is good proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We discussed various difficulties that have been happening in Australia, and that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa should go there and help for..., just for visit, just to help. And then they will report to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is Iran's business going on? I got some good report from Nandarāṇī that she is in contact with the Shah's daughter, princess. Is that a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Well, Nandarāṇī Prabhu is doing very well. She's got a <span class="Italic">Gurukula,</span> a school for the Indian children, they are being well attended. Also Mahārāja, Parivrājakācārya Svāmī, he has been in touch with the Shah's daughter and he's been preaching to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shah's son-in-law is interested, I have heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, he is interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's good. They are enlightened, the daughter and the son-in-law both?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Well, they are both interested, but they are also very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Biased. They are also biased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">Trans-India</span> people, they'll come tomorrow, at four-thirty, if that's all right, and the doctor is on his way up now. He'll be here in five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Dayānanda Prabhu is doing very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Very, very first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he's doing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> First of all, he's helping in every program we have. He's very cooperative, very intelligent boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he's very good boy.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. What salary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Sperry, Sperry Univac.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What salary he is getting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Ah, he's getting about twelve, thirteen hundred dollars now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salary? Yes. He was getting in America six hundred. (laughs) Getting double.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And he will get a lot more and more. He will get a lot more. And he is..., we have our regular programs, he brings people from business, we all bring people, and the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and chanting and lecture. It's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so Nandarāṇī is also working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> She is happy. She, for a while she taught at a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> school, from that school...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has got experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, she's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of them are very intelligent. And Nandarāṇī is more intelligent than her husband. (laughs) I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> I find that he is very intelligent, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Dayānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is intelligent, but Nandarāṇī is still more intelligent. (laughs) I know that. Both of them are intelligent, but this girl appears to be more intelligent. That's all right. What about their daughters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They are there. They're very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> In Tehran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have gone there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, when?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> About two months ago, a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw them in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, they left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Must have been just after we left there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> A month ago, five, six weeks ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got two daughters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. They are there, they also attend <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> They have it regularly now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> So that reporter was very impressed. He's a very big reporter. He works for the API, the Associated Press. They give their news to papers all over the world, the news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him represent properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes. You have given him a very unique interview, I think, with your analogies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is there. Why they think Eastern, Western, Jewish, and...? We are talking of the human being. That is the misunderstanding going on, that this is Hindu religion, Eastern religion. Kṛṣṇa begins from the word <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Find out this. The rascals are taking Hindu, Muslim, Christian. <span class="Italic">Dehe,</span> the body, and the inner force of the body, He's beginning His teaching. Where is the question of Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Jewish? Still they are misunderstanding, "This is Hindu."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It is very hard for them to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is science. Read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, <span class="Italic">kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā,</span> boyhood, childhood, youthhood, old age, is it for the Hindus? The Christians do not become child, do not become youth? <span class="Italic">Ayi.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is Dr. Bhagat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhagat. You are from Gujarat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Bhagat:</span> Gujarat, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's one of our life members also, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She's your wife? Child? How many children you have got? How many children you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Bhagat:</span> One.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only one?</div>
<div class="Verse">ekaś candras tamo hanti<br class="calibre2"/>na ca tārā-gaṇair api<br class="calibre2"/>varam eko guṇī-putro<br class="calibre2"/>na ca mūrkha-śatair api (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para">There is no need of hundreds of rascal child, children. One is sufficient. <span class="Italic">Varam eka. Varaṁ guṇī-putra,</span> he must be qualified. And who is <span class="Italic">guṇī,</span> who is a devotee and learned scholar. <span class="Italic">Ko'ta putreṇa jātena, yo na vidyā na bhaktimān(?).</span> What is the use of such rascal child if he's not a devotee, neither learned? <span class="Italic">Khanena cakṣuṣā kiṁ cakṣuḥ pīḍaiva kevalam.(?)</span> What is the use of blind eyes? It is simply troublesome. So let there be one child, but he must be like Prahlāda, like Dhruva Mahārāja, and then child production is beneficial. Otherwise, if we beget children like cats and dogs, what is the use? That is Cāṇakya Paṇḍita's instruction. Another example is given: <span class="Italic">ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca tārā-sahasrasaḥ.</span> If there is one moon in the sky, it is sufficient to give light to the whole sky. What is the use of millions of stars? So, it is very good that you can take care of one child and make him a great devotee and learned scholar. Then it is successful. So Dr. Bhagat, I get some pain. It is... (end)</div>
