<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> If you're not feeling well today, it can be postponed to another day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not feeling... (pause) I did not eat even today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda says he did not eat today, Bhakti-caru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> You were sleeping, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the afternoon. That's why I didn't wake you up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There was no food at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Didn't Prabhupāda get milk and barley this morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Also you said he took twelve spoons of <span class="Italic">khicuṛi</span> and <span class="Italic">loki?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. You took some lunch today, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You took morning and lunch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But compared to other days, you took as much or more. Well, then we can postpone and we can put ourselves under the care of this other <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> who came the other day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Remember the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> from the Raṅgajī temple? The assistant that this man was going to bring. So now we can be put under his care and take our chances. 'Cause that's what staying here means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> The <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he explained that if you remained here, that would be good. But he didn't think there was any risk of death for you to go to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, actually, when I was making <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> this corner, I was feeling fainted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This corner?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> At the turn. Prabhupāda felt like fainting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I saw when he closed his eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, most of this traveling that we're going to do, you will be laying down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That laying down and this laying down, that is different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, then we have to think of what the alternative is. Staying here means being subject to the possible care of this assistant who you saw the other day, 'cause this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will not wait any longer. He can't stay here any longer. We can try and convince him to stay, but I don't know how successful we will be. And he may give his medicines, but if some unforeseen difficulty develops, then it means that we are under the care of this other person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This palanquin <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> is very rough. You're bouncing up and down. You're going swinging sideways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (aside:) It's not as rough as traveling to Māyāpura, though, not one tenth as rough or one fiftieth. You know, all you got to do is go on a rough road. It's nothing. This palanquin is smooth compared to that, going slowly and being carried. I think the main point, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that we have to consider going as opposed to staying here with the possibility of being at the..., under the care of this other <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>. That to me is the choice. This <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will give medicines... First of all, we can try to convince him to stay, but failing that, he's giving a series of medicines which he expects will be proper according to the condition. But naturally the condition can change on any date. Then what will we do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I say no medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No medicine. We should reject this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yadubara was asking how much time the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> would stay with you in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every few days he'll be there, every two days, every three days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> He said like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he's prepared to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is there some... You're feeling some bad effect from these medicines that you want to reject them? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least there is risk of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We've also seen, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that while you've been here in Vṛndāvana without this <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> your condition has steadily deteriorated. Now he's come, and there's some slight improvement. We can speak to him about staying, but it's highly unlikely that he'll be able to stay away from his practice for any time longer. Then, if your condition turns again, then what do we do? There's also risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Risk is there, and risk is here. So better take the risk here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> And chance of survival is here and chance of survival is there. But where is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Provided you reach there. There is survival or whatever it may be, but whether there is arrival? The best thing is no medicine and kindly give me some (sic:) circumambulation and leave me to the fate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, don't you think that the medicine is working, is having some good effect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is working, then why I'm not feeling any strength?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That will come slowly, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That means I have to take the medicine and not that risking. The best thing is, whatever service you can give, you arrange. Leave me without medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Why is that the best thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Why is that the best thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because all, everything has failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has not promised miraculous recovery. He has said it takes time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. At least fifteen days, he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We're all feeling encouraged for the first time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Actually the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has left it up to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He said that the way you have cured your cough and cold in just a day, in just a few hours' time, the same way you can cure all your disease if you want, just yourself, without any medicine. At the same time, you dreamt this Rāmānuja<span class="Italic"> kavirāja</span> giving you the medicine, and ever since you started taking the medicines there has been some good effect, like you started passing more urine, you started getting a little appetite, little taste, your swelling has gone down, to some extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Swelling has not... (long silence)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? About two days ago you said that either the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> should stay here or we should go with him. So why should we change that idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in this morning I was fainting. So there was no strength. How long I (sic:) circumbulate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About a half hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even half hour, if I am fainting... So if I die without medicine, without <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> what is the harm? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> According to the <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> his treatment is that first of all he has to take care of your liver and kidneys before giving you strength. He said there's no question of you getting any strength until your liver and kidneys are healed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So take the medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So the first part of his cure is to help your liver and kidneys. Then, when they are functioning properly, you'll be able to eat and other things which will automatically give strength. Medicine will not give strength, but medicine can cure the organs which are now not working properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you take medicine from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. That was his proposal. His proposal was that you take medicine, and then after ten or fifteen days, you may have enough strength... And he was going to come back and then take you to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The only reason that we were hesitant was because if something along the way happens, had he been here, he could have adjusted the medicine to suit the particular needs. Now, not being here, we'll have to depend upon this assistant in case something changes. If nothing changes, then there's no harm. But if something should suddenly alter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alter means death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it doesn't mean death. Alter means supposing you suddenly develop some... You can't say what it will be. It doesn't necessarily mean death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Some secondary ailments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Anything may come up. Just like sometimes you get a cough. Cough doesn't mean death. Sometimes you pass a little more stool. That doesn't mean death. So anyway, the idea is that having a <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> personally present naturally is the best thing. So if it's not possible, and that does develop, then we'll have to call upon the man he's..., this assistant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why call Māyāpura? Let him supply the medicine from Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Supply the medicine from Calcutta. Well, he said he can give enough medicine now to last I think for about another ten days. Even now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. The main medicine, we have the supply for ten days already, that, the one that he distilled yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of course, we can still try and convince him not to go. That would be the best thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's staying, but actually you are administering his medicine. It doesn't require...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> His presence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Providing everything goes according to his plan. Yes, his presence is simply an encouragement, not necessarily a necessity so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he cannot stay, let his medicine remain and let him go. But if you think that I am burden now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's not what we think. We will never think that. There will never come that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We are the burden, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are the cause of your disease, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You have to drag us back to Godhead. That is a very big burden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So as you think... But this morning I was fainting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That is because this <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> is very strenuous, Śrīla Prabhupāda, this jerking and swinging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how...? How? How we can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So three hours to Delhi, then the plane ride and then three hours to Māyāpura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, I mean that is out of the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not out of the question. We were considering doing it. (laughter) It's only three hours away. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The cars are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The cars are coming. The tickets are booked. It's not out of the question. Śatadhanya's in Calcutta. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> But then again there is one advantage, that all along he can lie down. His Divine Grace can lie down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> The only time he feels faint is when he's sitting up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Upendra says that the time that you get faint is when you're sitting up. If you lay down you don't get faint. If the issue is that you got faint, then that's only because... I've seen you sitting in this bed and getting fainting sometimes, sitting up, fainting. Laying down... You can't faint when you lay down. Fainting is when you're sitting up. But practically the whole time you'll be sitting up, I mean laying down. And neither fainting is not necessarily... That is not a sign of death, fainting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fainting means of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda? I know myself, I have a history where I have fainted more than twenty-five times in my life, and I did not die. I fainted in so many different places. In the subways in New York...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are young man, and I am already dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why don't we see what the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> thinks, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Should we call him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (whispering) Why <span class="Italic">"phish-phish"?</span> Why not talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Why whispering?" Upendra was saying that not going is all right, but the fact that you are rejecting medicine, that is not good. So I was saying that I don't really think that you're rejecting the medicine, but you're taking that position so that we settle in between. (laughing) I can understand that you appreciate that the medicine is doing some good, but in order to get us to agree...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It is you who were saying that by Prabhupāda's not going, then we're at a loss for medicine. So then Prabhupāda said, "All right, then no medicine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Also Prabhupāda's saying no medicine so that if we say, "All right, stay, but take the medicine," then Prabhupāda will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He'll agree to that, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Transcendental bargaining. (laughs) Śrīla Prabhupāda, I have seen you dealing with the most tricky people in the world. I saw you dealing with that Mr. Nair, and then with that other man, Mr. Ratnaparki? So I can understand that when you say, (laughs) "No medicine at all," that we will then simply say, "Well, please, Śrīla Prabhupāda, just take medicine and then you stay here," and you'll say, "All right." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I want simply once <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One <span class="Italic">mahā-parikrama</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, one time around. Not many times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. As I am doing, that much. Medicine, no medicine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, actually we're also wanting you to do <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> but we would..., one day we are hoping to see you walking the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. For the time being, if by <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> fainting, dying, that is a glorious. That I want. Will it be great burden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. That's not the question, of burden. The only thing is that we want you to get better. There's no question of burden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, better...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Burden of love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better... If suppose I am sure to die, then where is better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but we don't suppose that. We're not supposing that you're sure to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We don't feel that at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I don't think there's any question that you're going to die, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the morning this symptom...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, you fainted... Although you don't remember sometimes, you have fainted at least a half a dozen times in the last month or two. I know you don't recall it, because we did not say anything. But we have seen you faint at least a half a dozen times, actually faint, falling backwards a little bit in bed when you were sitting up. In extreme weakness, fainting is natural. It is not necessarily a symptom of death. It's due to excessive weakness. The blood does not circulate properly in the head, and one faints. I mean people faint all over the world all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> On Janmāṣṭamī when they're fainting... When all the devotees fast, everyone faints. All day long they're fainting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> On Janmāṣṭamī, when there's mandatory fasting for all the devotees, half of the devotees are fainting throughout the day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They faint?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Subhaga always faints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes devotees faint just from fasting one day. You have fasted for six months, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If you faint a little bit, it's not a sign of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I am welcoming death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know. That's the... That's why we're talk...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> But we are not. We are not welcoming the idea of your death, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You say, "What is the harm?" There is no harm for you. Your return to Kṛṣṇa has been assured from your very birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not allow me to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We are thinking of the harm for us and the rest of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on Kṛṣṇa. But for me, if you give me this facility-one <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> and then leave me to my fate-you'll give me... Because I am not eating, so keep me whole day as I am. But if you think that I have become burden, then... (whispering) Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I was just saying, Śrīla Prabhupāda, something must have happened that you're feeling somehow that we think that you have become a burden. But we don't feel that way at all, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> You've given the example in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that when a capitalist has money, that's also a burden. And when the woman has a child, that child is a burden. So in the same way... But that burden is a burden of love. So you're that kind of burden, the kind of burden that's wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is <span class="Italic">kavirāja?</span></div>

<div class="Normal-Level">(very poorly recorded)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...offered him respect. This Bajaj, he was speaking something to him, offering him some respect. This morning they just had their organizational meeting, and they've asked one of our representatives to come and speak about our activities. So Akṣayānanda Swami will speak, and he will speak in Hindi. One of the things they mentioned... 'Cause I was saying this morning that we're having difficulty also getting the younger people to join, so they thought that one reason is that our men are not able to speak the Indian languages. These people are also very attached to Indian language. They're pro-Indian language. So if he speaks in Hindi, that will be an influence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is Māyāvādī, this... What is? Akhandananda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You met him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I didn't see... You remember you went to that Kurukṣetra meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> About two years ago? Mainly the same people are here also that were there at that meeting. Then this Swami Cinmayananda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No. They were just talking about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't bother to come here, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But they treated you with much respect, though. They said that they had wanted Your Divine Grace to come because you are also a member of their steering committee. (indistinct) They also had a proposal to produce a series of different books, small books, pamphlets, forty, fifty pages, comprising selections from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And these would be for specific types of persons. The books would be <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for students, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for businessmen, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for scientists, like that. So they want us to produce the book for the scientists, taking various quotes from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> with a short explanation of the verse. So I said one problem is that all the different groups who are assembled here will all have different interpretations of the verses. What about this? And they said, "No, no, we shouldn't interpret." I said, "Well, one reason that the young people are not taking up this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is because they see that everyone is giving a different interpretation. Nobody is presenting it as it is, so they're confused." I was in Kashmir, I was speaking with some young boys. They were telling me they're confused by religion. They don't respect the <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> in the temples-they're all simply after money. They have no respect for religion, Hindu religion. So I mentioned this to all of them. They are all Māyāvādīs. And they argued with me. I presented arguments. They would not accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They want to avoid criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I argued right back with them. I said, "You..." They were saying that we shouldn't interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I said, "Then why are you saying that Kṛṣṇa means 'divine consciousness'? Where does Kṛṣṇa say 'divine consciousness'? He says, <span class="Italic">mām, aham.</span> He doesn't say 'divine consciousness.' He says 'to Me.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> say. We have to follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Very good. They do not answer. And they... Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But they don't listen to you. We tell them the truth, but they don't want to hear it. They just want to come and become important by their attending this meeting, become puffed up and speak their own ideas and think that they're accomplishing some real...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One of the delegates, he is sitting there, and he was spinning thread on a hand spinner. Then afterwards he stopped and even he fell asleep during the meeting. We were arguing about personalism and impersonalism, and Mr. Bajaj, he interrupted that "Now, you shouldn't... The purpose of this meeting is not to discuss <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> but just to discuss how to promote <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No idea of... He has no authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One thing they recognize is that the young people of India, they want to see the experience of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like Arjuna in the beginning was bewildered and in the end he agreed. So that experience... I said, "Yes, and we have had the same experience, because as Westerners, in the beginning we didn't even the know the name Kṛṣṇa, and now we are serving Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day. So obviously there was some great experience. So that has been given to us by Śrīla Prabhupāda." And then he recognized, "Yes." I said, "So we are... We can actually give our experience." So then he suggested that some publication be made actually dealing with the experiences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we are giving. This <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> discourse...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I think now that our books are coming out in the Indian languages and are being distributed, I think this will cause young Indians...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Young Indians are not... They have already published these things. Scientific investigation of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, they appreciated that we are preaching to the scientists. They liked that, that we're the only ones who are doing this, because the scientists are amongst the biggest atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This <span class="Italic">Gītā Pratiṣṭhāna</span> is a good proposal, transport(?) <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is</span> all over the world. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> When I was in Jammu, we went to visit a big army base there, Indian Army, huge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. And we went to visit one colonel, full colonel, in charge of supply. He's a very pious men. He tells his soldiers not to drink, not to eat meat, and he teaches them <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. So we went to go speak with him, and he was very impressed. He himself admitted that he was taking eggs and drinking tea. So I requested him to stop this, and then you'll be on the..., purely. And he could understand that. He agreed. He said, "From now on, from this day, I will stop." And we showed him the film, "Hare Kṛṣṇa People," and he was very impressed. He called another officer in, and they called their wives to come to the base, and we showed it a second time. And then he wanted some of our books. I gave him <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and Hindi <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and then told him about our Gurukula here in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How much he paid? (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, he was wanting to pay, but Nava-yogendra Mahārāja said it's all right... We asked him to become a member. He didn't want to pay so much money. So we gave him... Because he was an important officer, we gave him. Then he offered... He has some land 25 miles from Delhi, and he said, "We would like to give it for a Hindu temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who was there, this meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This meeting? Well, the meeting was led by the three men who came to see you this morning. The center was the man from Auroville, and then Mr. Nārāyaṇa and Mr. Bajaj.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that will be three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Of the three, Mr. Nārāyaṇa is very favorable to us. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami was noticing it. He preached to him about two or three years ago. At that time he was chief minister for Gujarat, governor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I want to suggest that you should not talk too much, because the doctor said conserve yourself. (indistinct) Because tomorrow we're going to be leaving at about two o'clock, two or two-thirty, so you won't get a full night's rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are the most important (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bon Mahārāja you did not see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He didn't see me. I was in the back, and he was in the front. Mr. Jaluka came. I spoke with him, and he asked about you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The reason I don't want you to talk so much now, because I suspect they're all going to want to come and see you, and then you'll definitely talk too much. If they're all here, they're all going to want to see you. (indistinct) It's very prestigious that it's being held in our temple. In such a short time this temple has become (indistinct) for very important meetings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Bon Mahārāja, he had this idea for making this center in Vṛndāvana, and now, after so many years, it's practically closed. Everything's shut down. Ghost town. Just in two-three, three years our temple is now the most popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now we will pay them our (indistinct) but we will go on watching. That we want. As long as you're watching them, we will (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They haven't got (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. He's definitely impersonalist. But he's not very serious, caught in family life. He associates with these people. I mean his philosophy's Caitanya Mahāprabhu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They want to see our films tonight. They want to see the film on New Vrindaban, "Spiritual Frontier." They'll show it tonight at 8:30. And they want <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Mr. Nārāyaṇa, he's very much wanting us to have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> He said, "That is the thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, you should rest, really. Probably all the men will come to see you, so you can talk directly with them. (long pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They were arguing with me. They would not accept. They were so strong Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually this is one way that we ought to be able to... First of all, it would be prestigious on our part to stick to our principles, and secondly, actually people will find that we're convinced when they'll see, "You are Māyāvādī, we have no bus... You are not..." At first they may feel offended, that why shouldn't we let everybody speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda says, in future, henceforward, these people should not be allowed to hold lectures here. Strictly Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching forbids. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī haya kṛṣṇe aparādhī.</span> You tell them, "You're Māyāvādī. So this is a Kṛṣṇa conscious temple. If you're speaking on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Vaiṣṇavism..." We don't need their money, neither do we need them to become more prestigious. Rather, they need us. They came here only because of the fact that they're so insignificant that they wanted to be associated with Prabhupāda. Without you they have no substance, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Without your presence the meeting has no substance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because you are the only substantial personality amongst all of them. Therefore they know that. We have concluded that they know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I just spoke. I just told them Śrīla Prabhupāda was one Indian who has done this, so if everyone in India does this a little, then the whole world would become Vaikuṇṭha. And I said, "He has one secret, one <span class="Italic">śloka</span> from the <span class="Italic">Bṛhad Nāradīya Purāṇa: harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">."</span> They liked it very much. They all applauded. I told them in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You spoke in Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they won't change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I also said that many, many swamis and yogis and <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> have tried to bring the teachings all over the world. And they have given different versions, just like <span class="Italic">dhyāna, jñāna, karma,</span> etc. But then I quoted two <span class="Italic">ślokas, na tad mām abhijānanti,</span> and the other one, <span class="Italic">yas tas tu aham evaṁ viduḥ.(?)</span> I said, "In this way our spiritual master has taught us. Even though we are foreigners, he has successfully made us come to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. So if you are all Indians and you know Lord Kṛṣṇa better than me, so come and stay with us. All over the world my Guru Mahārāja has established our temples. Please stay with us anywhere in the world and help us, join us at the lotus feet of the Lord." So they were very happy with this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's good that you tell this to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bombay also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially everybody's going to be after us for that air-conditioned hall. It's really good that you're telling us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Be very careful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Your Divine Grace and this movement is the only substantial movement left in India now, in the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can have signboard: "No Māyāvādīs visit (?) here." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. Just like "No dogs allowed." (laughter) Are you serious about that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> If they come and they want to hold meetings, we show them the signboard that "We don't allow Māyāvādīs here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, on the signboard we'll quote the verse from Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they do not hold meetings in Bon Mahārāja's...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, there's a number of reasons. One is that you are not in Bon Mahārāja's place, and they want your presence, because they are inconsequential without you. And another thing is that Bon Mahārāja's place is a little bit archaic, dilapidated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I remember you went there I think two years ago, and (indistinct) Bon Mahārāja there within one room. And he came to turn the light on in the room, and there was no light bulb in the socket. They had to go and get a light bulb and put it in. I mean he doesn't even use that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is closed now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Soon he will rent a room here in the guesthouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He was at the (indistinct). This morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the guesthouse they can remain. But they cannot hold meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They were asking me that we should cooperate with them, but they are envious of us. This one woman, the way she was speaking to me, it was quite... She was attacking me. She was so envious. She was quoting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that Kṛṣṇa recommends the impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why is she talking? Why talk? Everything is illusion. Then why talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> She said there are two paths. I said, "Yes, but your path is most difficult. So why are you promoting the most difficult path to follow?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But who cares for her path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> (indistinct) a different path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. You remain strong. Don't be intimidated by this... That is my request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I think we should go to the next room. We will do just exactly as you say. [break] (end)</div>
