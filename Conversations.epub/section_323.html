<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...has done a great mistake. I never expected... (noise) ...all of a sudden... [break] You see the so-called swamis and yogis. They could not do anything, because they are outsider. They are not within the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa. One must remain within the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa. Then his spiritual life is assured. Otherwise, paramour(?). [break] Similarly, everything, everyone belongs to Kṛṣṇa's family, but we have to see what he's doing for Kṛṣṇa. Just like everyone is citizen of the state. Why a man is given high position and big title? Why? Because he's recognized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one must give service. Simply to feel, "I belong to Kṛṣṇa's family," and doing nothing for Kṛṣṇa, that is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> That's no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's no good. That is not good. That means he'll... Very soon he'll again forget Kṛṣṇa. He'll again forget Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Actually, the other element is so powerful. These people here, because, even though they are part of Kṛṣṇa's family, but because they have forgotten, then we become influenced by their forgetfulness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Forgetfulness means <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> is nothing. It is a forgetfulness. That's all. It has no existence. Forgetfulness, it does not stand. But so long it is there, it is very troublesome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I've been asked a question by some devotees sometimes that they don't feel happy. So even if they are unhappy, mentally, should, they still should continue in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I tell them, even if one is unhappy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you should show example. If you show example different way, how they will follow you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Example is better than precept. Why you are living outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Well, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...last time I was so much deteriorated in health, I had to leave this place. That does not mean I'll leave the Society. I went to India and recuperated. Or came to London. That's all right. So health may be sometimes... But that does not mean we shall give up the Society. If my health is unsuitable here, I go... I have a hundred centers. And you'll not go out of this universe for your health recouping. You have to remain within the universe. Then why do you go out of the Society? [break] ...Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. We have to live with devotees. Why I left my family? Because they were not devotees. Therefore I come... Otherwise, in old age, I would have been comfortable. No. We should not live with the nondevotees, may be family men or anyone. Just like Mahārāja Vibhīṣaṇa. Because his brother was not devotee, he left him, left him. He came to Rāmacandra. Vibhīṣaṇa. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So Prabhupāda, it says that a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should live alone. That means only with devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who...! Where it is said <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should live alone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I mean, sometimes in your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Sometimes in your books. So that means with devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In general, <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> may live alone. But <span class="Italic">sannyāsī's</span> duty is to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> That I don't ever want to stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I don't ever want to stop preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Well, preaching, you cannot manufacture preaching. You must do preaching according to the principles ordered by your spiritual master. You cannot manufacture your own way of preaching. That is required. There must be some leader. Under the leadership. <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat...</span> Why it is said? Everywhere, in the office, there is some immediate boss. So you have to please him. That is service. Suppose in office, in a department there is office superintendent. And if you do in your own way, "Yes, I'm doing my business," and the office superintendent is not pleased, do you think that kind of service is nice? No. Similarly, we have got, everywhere we have got immediate boss. So we must work. That is systematic. If everyone manufactures, invents his own way of life, then there must be chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yeah, that's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now we are world organization. There is spiritual side, and there is material side also. That is not material side. That is also spiritual side, means systematic management. Otherwise how it will be done? Just like Gaurasundara sold the house, and there is no trace of the money. What is this? He did not ask him, anyone. He sold the house, and where is the money, there is no trace. [break] Ah, Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is that badge? Tennis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's not a badge. It's the only sweater I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. Yesterday I received one letter from Rūpānuga Mahārāja. He's preaching very nice. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Rūpānuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> There have been several people here in Los Angeles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> ...that have wanted to meet you. A councilman, a councilman here in Los Angeles would like to meet you, a city councilman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes. He's welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So, and, and um, also a Professor Scharfe at the UCLA, he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Professor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Professor Scharfe. He's a Sanskrit scholar of the Vedic, Vedic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Scharfer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Scharfe. Scharfe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's not Scharfer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Scharfe, spelled S-c-h-a-r-f-e.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, I met him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes. He would like very much to meet with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Make appointment. What, what is his purpose to meet me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Well, Professor Scharfe is interested in your writings, and I don't know the councilman's motives. He just sent word to me that he would like to meet with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We welcome any respectable gentleman. We have to go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Uh, yeah, Prabhupāda, we can go this way, through here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The scientists will never give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They are like Jarāsandha. They come back every day on your walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have any specific reference for <span class="Italic">acintya</span> in the Vedic reference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acintya, acintya,</span> yes, <span class="Italic">acintya.</span> <span class="Italic">Acintya</span> potency, even you have got <span class="Italic">acintya</span> potency. That I have already explained. Because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, therefore there is pinch of <span class="Italic">acintya,</span> inconceivable potency, in us also. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Do we have any specific reference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jīva Gosvāmī. Jīva Gosvāmī has stated that unless we accept <span class="Italic">acintya,</span> inconceivable energy, there is no conception of God. There is no conception of God. If you bring God to your conception, he's not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">Acintya, acintya-bheda</span> is a unique contribution of Vaiṣṇavas to the concept of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Actually, that is the fact. We cannot explain what is God. We have to accept what is God from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Avaroha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Avaroha</span> process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, not <span class="Italic">ava...</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">avaroha</span> process. Yes, thank you. Here Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to accept that. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So "There is no more superior authority than Me." <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> (loud waves drowns out voice)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ...</span> [Bg 10.2].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> What to speak of these teeny scientists, even the great sages can't know Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even Lord Brahmā, when he saw the innumerable Viṣṇu forms of the child Kṛṣṇa, then he himself said that "As far as I know, as far as I am concerned, I don't know anything about You."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he... Yes. That is the Brahmā's position, what to speak of others. <span class="Italic">Yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā devāya tasmai namaḥ. Yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ.</span> Brahmā, Varuṇa, all demigods. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra.</span> Rudra even, Śiva, Lord Śiva. <span class="Italic">Stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadair gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ, dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That Bhārati cited this verse. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The five gods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Is that by Śaṅkarācārya, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is Vedic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Where is it from, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Where is it from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is the Bhāgavatam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadair gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I remember Śrīla Prabhupāda used this "<span class="Italic">acintya</span>" to differentiate between the life and the non-living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acintya</span> means living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti.</span> Life, life has <span class="Italic">acintya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Whereas non-life doesn't have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Matter, just like a molecule doesn't have this <span class="Italic">acintya.</span> But they may...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it has, but it is covered too much. Consciousness is covered. Potency, potent. It is potent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Molecule has consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything has consciousness, but it is covered. The degree is of covering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> I was reading the writings of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in <span class="Italic">Jaiva Dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> And he is explaining the word <span class="Italic">"śraddhā,</span>" and he defines it in there as the tendency of the mind towards devotion without regard to <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> or <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā.</span> And I have heard it variously interpreted as meaning "faith" or "belief," which really falls short of that interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Could you elaborate on the definition of <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā</span> is explained in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā</span> means firm conviction. That is <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supermost." So if you have firm conviction in Kṛṣṇa's words, that is <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have doubts, then that is not <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So therefore one can understand only if one is in <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> has to be increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> How it is increased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The beginning of <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> means firm conviction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> How is it <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> does not exist in one person, and it does exist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> is there. It has to be awakened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā</span> is in every person then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore I say it is covered. It is covered. That covering has to be taken away. That is called <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> (indistinct). That is called culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">Upāsanā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Upāsanā, bhajana, sādhana,</span> culture, whatever you say. He has to awaken that <span class="Italic">śraddhā,</span> more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, is every <span class="Italic">jīva</span> given a chance in the beginning to go in the spiritual world? Then he falls down, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Or sometimes the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> may choose directly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is atomic. It is smaller than the atoms. One ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. <span class="Italic">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatāṁśaḥ sādṛśātmakaḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]<span class="Italic">.</span> So every living entity, atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Is he first allowed...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Less than the atom. Smaller than the atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Is he allowed to associate with Kṛṣṇa in the beginning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> As <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> as <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's always with Kṛṣṇa. Simply he has forgotten. Have you not been with Kṛṣṇa? We are standing on this sand. The sand is Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's energy. We are standing by the water. This is Kṛṣṇa's energy. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Don't you read that? So is it different from Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> No, but it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My body is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. I am also Kṛṣṇa's energy. I am always with Kṛṣṇa. Simply I have forgotten it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But this is Kṛṣṇa's inferior energy, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be. That is a comparative study, inferior or superior. But it is energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As energy, it is not different from Kṛṣṇa, as energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As energy, how can you differentiate from Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> You give the... It could be described as like the growth of a plant as compared to the energy of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> The growth of a plant as compared to the energy of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> The growth of the plant is the inferior energy, and the... (loud waves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are so many things. That is comparative study. But... (loud waves) Energy is not different from the energetic. Sunshine is not different from the sun. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ.</span> Everything is Bhagavān, but it appears like different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Is that what it means by <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Everything is spiritual, but when it is... due to our ignorance, we think it is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but don't associate with... (indistinct) ...must realize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So Māyāvādīs artificially think that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have no realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Somebody even asked me about what is material and what is spiritual, Prabhupāda. I said that whatever is in connection with God is spiritual and whatever is not in connection with God is material. Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The consciousness makes a difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Your consciousness makes the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Because everything is in connection with God except for our own consciousness when we're in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we are taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> How it is spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It is offered to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By knowledge... Because it is offered to Kṛṣṇa. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there. So anything which is accepted in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is spiritual thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> In perfect knowledge, would the first step be faith that it is offered to Kṛṣṇa? One may, may make an offering without being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, he must learn under superior direction. Otherwise, how he can offer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Well, he may make an attempt. There is a natural impulse to serve, a natural impulse to offer in man, and he may not be aware that he is seeking Kṛṣṇa in his conditioned state. Then, if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then whom he's offering? If he doesn't know Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That is his ignorance. If he is seeking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, if he's in ignorance, what is the value of his offering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> I did not hear the last point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> If he's in ignorance, what is the value of the offering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He needs a spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do anything in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> But then the spiritual master gives him knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> ...and then from that knowledge he becomes aware that...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Spiritual master gives knowledge, and then a disciple is eternally indebted to spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It is not that, like Māyāvādīs, they serve the spiritual master in the beginning and then they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eternally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Somebody told me, Prabhupāda, about Vallabhācārya, that he sometimes, he once went to Lord Caitanya and said that he wrote a better commentary than a previous <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> and Lord...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śrīdhara Svāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Lord Caitanya chastised him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> An unchaste wife who abandons a swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He referred to Śrīdhara Svāmī. So swami means husband. So He sarcastically remarked, "Anyone who does not accept swami, she is prostitute."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Is Vallabhācārya, Prabhupāda, in accordance with our philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he's Vaiṣṇava, <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> But that very deviation, that "I have done something better than Śrīdhara," that is not our <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. Then he was thinking himself better than Śrīdhara. That is not allowed. We should always remain servant of the servant [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80]. Never we shall think that "I am better than my Guru Mahārāja." That is fall down. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare... Our Juhu Beach is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All clean, and you can walk very nicely. In Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And lot of people can see you. And they bow down to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they do not, what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Well, no, if they do, then they will go to Vaikuṇṭha. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our śāstric injunction, that as soon as you see a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> you must bow down. Otherwise, you should fast one day. It doesn't matter, I or you. This is the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is supposed to be the guru of the society. So one must bow down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, in our movement there are so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> If we see the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> same, so many times in one day, we should bow down every time we see him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It wouldn't hurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...this time He used to take His <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party for strolling all over the city.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has already come to an end. There is no government anywhere, simply chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, do you think that the ISKCON will, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness will become a major religion in any country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness will become a major religion in any country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far the statement goes, <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu [Bg. 7.3],</span> one can understand. But even one person understands, it is beneficial for many. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Just like you understood your Guru Mahārāja's message, and the whole world is benefited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Not everybody can be that potent. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...just like the sunshine is open to everyone, but if you do not take advantage of it, that is your fault. Sunshine is not meant for, specifically for any person. It is open to everyone. But if you purposefully close your door, and do not see the sunshine, that is your fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda, but there's only one earthly planet, and you have conquered it already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Is not a true Vaiṣṇava also a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> Would you explain the difference between them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Is not a, one who is truly a Vaiṣṇava, is he not also a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> by his...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī, sannyāsī</span> is in the material platform, and Vaiṣṇava is in the spiritual platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So then the Vaiṣṇava is superior to a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's not <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He's above <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Oh. But a Vaiṣṇava would always offer his respects to a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Is that not true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa was offering respect to His elderly persons. That is etiquette.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Step aside a little bit so that Prabhupāda can... If you stay to the side a little bit, you box Prabhupāda in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> There's some austerity, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They're sleeping on the beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the benefit of their sleeping? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They save their rent money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? That is his misfortune. That is a young man's fashion in your country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not austerity. That is licentiousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes. It comes from a time when we admire swashbuckling and being free, so-called, in the material sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is reaction. The rich man is trying to become a poor man. "Let me see what is the advantage of the poor man." That's right. Your country does not require to lie down like that. You have got enough arrangement. But it is a fashion. That's all. So fashion is not austerity. That is sense gratification. It appears like austerity, but it is sense gratification. Real austerity is not to make any sense gratification, simply to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is real austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So if Kṛṣṇa required us to sleep on the beach, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> ...that would not be... if Kṛṣṇa required us to sleep on the beach, that would not be sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. And why Kṛṣṇa will require like that? Do you mean to say Kṛṣṇa is a madman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes, I was thinking that too. Why would Kṛṣṇa require any of his devotees to sleep on the beach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to see His devotees are comfortably situated. Why He'll unnecessarily ask that "Go to the beach and lie down?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> You say that Kṛṣṇa stands there smiling very sweetly, playing the flute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So why should he require us to go through austerities like...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> means he must show by example. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari bhakti śikhāimu sabāre.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Is there such a thing as a sincere atheist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> ...who benefits by austerity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atheist? Atheist? How he's sincere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That's what I... That's what I'm asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Honest thief? It is contradictory. If I say, "Here is an honest thief," is that a good designation, honest thief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Well, in that case, that's so. You're right. It's absurd. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> A sincere atheist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> But there are those who appear... At least, they think, they feel they are sincere when they go through austerities, but they won't accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness as, at this point in their, in their existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, some atheists say that "We are Godless because nobody has convinced us about the existence of God." That is honesty. That is honesty. But there are rascals, however you may convince him, he'll not take it. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So the honest ones become devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We were all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he's honest, then he must take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> We were all atheists, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> We were all atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you, if, if, if an atheist is honest, then when he's convinced, he must accept Kṛṣṇa. That is honesty. If after convincing him, he does not take, that is dishonesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is dishonesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> But there's a quality in this age that one does not accept defeat philosophically, philosophical defeat. If one is presented with philosophically sound arguments, it is a tendency today to refuse to accept the superiority of Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy over any other philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> It's very popular to put all philosophies in the same... "Well, that's philosophy," they say. They say that "Everybody has his opinion. That's your opinion," they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So no one will accept any kind of superior philosophy. It's very difficult to discuss these things among them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then everyone, if becomes superior, then where is the question of philosophy? If everyone is superior himself, then there is no question of philosophy. Is there any necessity? You are superior, I am superior; then where is the question of discussing philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That is trying to be God. He's trying... Then we are always God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then philosophy becomes null and void. As soon as everyone becomes his own authority, then philosophy becomes null and void. There is no necessity of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That is the difficulty of our age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are rascals. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhāḥ.</span> If you do not accept philosophy, you do not accept authority, that means all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You said, <span class="Italic">"alpa-medhasaḥ...</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Outlaws, they are called outlaws. Just the outlaws, they do not accept any authority, government authority, or authority of the law, they're called outlaws. Rejected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yeah, well, this is a nation of outlaws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are rejected. If anyone, everyone becomes his own authority, then it is chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Well, that is the fashion today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Fashion means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> It's called "Do your own thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, who are you to say me, "Do your own thing"? Then you become master. You are directing me. Why should you direct me, "Do your own thing"? You stop. Don't talk. If your philosophy accepted that everyone is authority, you cannot say, "Do your own work." Why should you say? Then you become authority. You should not speak at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That is also a philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That is also a philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That "Do your own thing" is also a philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a philosophy. Why you are dictating? You'd better stop. Don't talk. That's all. You have no facility for talking. Have you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> No, I haven't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? You keep yourself satisfied with your own philosophy. I keep myself satisfied with my philosophy. There is no need of talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is good. If a foolish man does not talk, it is good for him and good for others. Because he'll talk foolish. Better not to talk. That is good. That... Infectious diseased man... what is called? Quarantine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Quarantine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's put separately so that he may not poison others. He may not poison others. So that is the position of the self-sufficient authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In Gujarati we call it: <span class="Italic">bhanji moti laksmim.</span>(?) When the palm is closed it is worth lakh rupees, but when it is open, it doesn't mean anything. A foolish person, when he talks, he reveals everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Foolish person means busy rascal. There are four kinds of division: lazy intelligent and busy intelligent and lazy rascal and busy rascal. The first-class man is lazy intelligent, and second class, busy intelligent, and third class, lazy rascal, and fourth class, busy rascal. A rascal, if he's busy, then what he will do? He'll simply do harm. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Create havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Create havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Havoc, create havoc. Just as they are doing now. All rascals, they are very busy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Creating atom bombs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, therefore the whole world is in confusion. All rascals, they are busy. What is the use of such business? Like monkey. Monkey's very busy, always, but doing harm. That's all. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, ugra-karmāṇaḥ kṣayāya jagato 'hitāḥ.</span> These rascals, they are busy just to destroy the whole world and do the mischief. That's all. Actually, they are doing so. That we also... In English language, sometimes it is said, "A sharp razor in the hands of a child." The child... That is this imitation. They want to imitate their father. So if he imitates the razor sharp, then he will create havoc. So these rascals, they have got now all power, and therefore creating havoc. They do not know how to use it. According to Vedic principle, the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they should not be given more money, the worker class. Now the worker class is given more money. So what they'll do? They'll produce drunkards. That's all. In America, it is evident. They do not know how to use money. So therefore we see, fifty-two percent drunkards in your country. Eh? What is the percentage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm not sure, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's probably close to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? At least fifty-percent. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Drunkards, debauchers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Criminals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. What is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Quarter to seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So we can...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We can walk around a little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> So how... Is it a waste of time then to present Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy to someone who believes in doing your own thing? Do you think that that is a...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is, it is... We should push Kṛṣṇa consciousness as disinfecting agent. They're all infected, the whole world. So by chanting you disinfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Just by our presence chanting then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore chanting is so important. Philosophy later on. First of all, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> cleansing the heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cleansing the heart. So by hearing this chanting their heart will be cleansed gradually. Then they will understand the real position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to do this chanting, not sit down in a solitary place, chanting himself. No, not like that. You are to vibrate the sound for the benefit of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> That is the mystical process of this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. So that their heart may be cleansed and they can understand. And if I sit down in a solitary place, for my benefit, that may be his benefit, but it is not very high class engagement. He must sacrifice for others. <span class="Italic">Pararthe prag utsri, utsri</span>(?). That is the Cāṇakya Paṇḍita's moral instruction, that "Everyone should sacrifice for the Supreme." Caitanya Mahāprabhu is God Himself. He comes down to preach, to become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and to take so much trouble all over India and everywhere, and giving instruction and sending men, "Go, go, go, go." What? Why you...? He's perfect. Why He's coming? He doesn't require. No. For the benefit of others, we must follow the footsteps of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. (aside:) That's all right. Why water is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I don't know, Prabhupāda. It's a low spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A Vaiṣṇava's first qualification that he's unhappy by seeing others unhappy. Vaiṣṇava cannot be unhappy. That Prahlāda Mahārāja says, that "I have no problem. I am unhappy seeing these people who are simply engaged in false activities and they do not care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore I am unhappy." This is Vaiṣṇava's qualification. Not that "I am saved. That's all right." That is materialism. "Let others go to hell. I am saved." That is materialism. A Vaiṣṇava should think always, "Oh, so many people are suffering. What I am doing for them?" That is Vaiṣṇava. <span class="Italic">Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is also said by scientists. They also say that "People are suffering. So we are trying to make them happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but if you do not know, how you'll make them happy? You'll create havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you do not know how to make them happy. First of all learn how to make them happy. You cannot manufacture your program to make them happy. That everyone is doing. But the more they are acting, the world becoming in chaotic condition. You know what is the standard of happiness, how to make them happy; then you can work. If a medical man, he has never seen a medical college and if he wants to treat patient, what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> A criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Quack. He must know how to make them happy. That is first business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> All glories to Prabhupāda. (Prabhupāda gets in the car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...basic disease. He has made himself voluntarily under the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> business is to give trouble. That's all. Otherwise, he's free, but he has voluntarily accepted the custody of <span class="Italic">māyā. Yayā sammohito jīvaḥ. Sammohitaḥ</span> means bewildered. <span class="Italic">Jīva,</span> the living entities. <span class="Italic">Ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam.</span> Everyone is identifying, "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am this body," "I am that body." This is identification with <span class="Italic">māyā. Ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam. Tat-kṛtaṁ cābhipadyate.</span> And as soon as he becomes under the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he'll act according to the dictation of <span class="Italic">māyā. Tat-kṛtaṁ cābhipadyate.</span> [break] ...to see their Los Angeles Zoo? Why they're advertising?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The Los Angeles what, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Zoo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Zoo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Oh yeah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's not a very good zoo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No, it's not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Just a small little one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The big zoo is in San Diego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, zoo in the Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Oh yeah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter) No, actually they go. There is a national zoo. Thousands of... Practically Africa's main income is from the tourists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Tourism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. People go to see. You'll, you'll drive your car. You'll find lions, elephants, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Recently one of Brahmānanda's men had an accident by hitting some animal on the road. Large animal, I think it was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, what accident?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> One of the vans. One of the devotees ran into an animal on the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> I'm not sure what it was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the national garden means there is arrangement. The animals are free, roaming. But you can go with your car and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they cannot attack within the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you come out, they'll attack. The lions are there, elephants are there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Not very cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No, no. Compared to Hawaii, it is very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Compared to Hawaii, it is very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Hawaii is very pleasant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, now it is eighty-five degrees every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> It's wintertime now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And summer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Summer's very hot. Hundred and five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is rainfall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Summer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. There's quite a bit now. Sometimes in the winter it rains. So that one devotee brought up the point of the philosophy of "Do your own thing," and that's what the devotees were instructed in Hawaii to do. When they closed the temple, Gaurasundara just said, "Now everyone go and do your own thing for Prabhupāda."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he does Prabhupāda's work, then where is the own thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yeah, right. There's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Do your own thing on behalf of Prabhupāda." So if he wants Prabhupāda, he must abide by the order of Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yeah. My thing is your thing. Actually, I have nothing of my own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have been misguided. But temple closing was very irresponsible... [break] ...house many years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Many years. (end)</div>
