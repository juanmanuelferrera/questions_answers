<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Jayapatākā Mahārāja, explain. You have got practical experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma jāra.</span> Those people who are born on the sacred land of Bhāratavarṣa, they should perfect their life, <span class="Italic">janma sārthaka kari',</span> and help others. Purpose of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to perfect one's own spiritual knowledge and then to go and help other people. So people that are born here in Bhāratavarṣa have a special facility because of the Vedic culture, Aryan culture, to perfect their lives. And just as Śrīla Prabhupāda has gone all over the world spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness-one person from this Bhāratavarṣa has been able to do so much-if other pure devotees would come and preach as Śrīla Prabhupāda has done, then how many unlimited amount of fallen souls could receive the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in so-called transcendental meditation, go to the Himalaya and go to the forest. We are not interested in all this nonsense. Our only business is to spread <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> door to door, town to town, city to city. We are not going to seclusion. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "This is professional bluff: 'I am going to the Himalaya. I am going to the forest.' " Prahlāda Mahārāja condemns that "These are professional bluffs." Or they may be sincere, but still, they are trying for their own salvation. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "I am not interested in that sal... I am interested for everyone's salvation. Everyone must go back to home, back to..." That is Vaiṣṇava, not that "For my own salvation I go to Himalaya or in the forest and transcendental meditation, nonsense..." We are not interested in those things. (laughs) And our men... Just like that Gaurasundara. He is doing all nonsense, transcendental meditation. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal. He is doing transcendental meditation. He got so much opportunity to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He did it in the beginning very nicely. A rascal, he became victim. These things are for <span class="Italic">ajitendriyāṇām.</span> Those who are not able to control the senses, they make this business, transcendental meditation, and secretly doing all nonsense. The whole thing, this transcendental meditation, that, what is that, Maharishi Yogi, they are doing all nonsense and advertising, "We are transcendental meditation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They openly advertise that "If you do transcendental meditation, then you can do your business better, you can have better sex life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that's all. So you can do your sense gratification process, <span class="Italic">yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi tuccham,</span> what is condemned by Prahlāda Mahārāja, that "This kind of happiness is most abominable and insignificant." <span class="Italic">Tuccham. Tuccham</span> means very insignificant. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span> It is just like itching between the two hand, and after-result is misery. That's all. <span class="Italic">Iva duḥkha-duḥkham. Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> They know it, that after this enjoyment of itching sensation there will be so much trouble. But <span class="Italic">neha tṛpyanti:</span> they are not satisfied. Again and again. <span class="Italic">Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> Begetting one child... Just see. It is going on. (children in background) No shame. That is animal. No shame. In Western countries they are learning... I have seen. In Los Angeles beach they are having sex open. Just like these birds or beasts. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> They are trying to make birth control. Why? <span class="Italic">Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> That illicit or legal sex, the after-result is very miserable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It seems that as a country, India's got the best chances for becoming fully Kṛṣṇa conscious again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere chance. Kṛṣṇa does not say for India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is not... You are making better progress, Western countries. Kṛṣṇa is not limited anywhere. But in India they have got the facilities. But they are becoming rascals, so they are not taking the facility. The facility is there. That is everywhere, especially in India. You see everywhere, every day, the sunrise, so beautiful. In Western country, some places, sometimes. But here you'll find every day. That is the facility. This is <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī mantra. Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi.</span> This facility is in here. You get sufficient sunlight, and in sunlight you keep very healthy and happy. That facility is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, last night you were saying, "The sun is moving." We can see the sun has just come up and is moving across the sky. So what do they base their statement that the sun is stationary? They have no basis in fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore rascals. They see one thing and speak another. That is rascal. <span class="Italic">Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta...</span> Huh? <span class="Italic">Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ. Aśeṣa-tejāḥ.</span> The... <span class="Italic">aśeṣa-tejāḥ,</span> unlimited temperature and light. They are studied. This is <span class="Italic">aśeṣa-tejāḥ.</span> If they have studied the quality of the sun, how they can say something wrong about the movements? That is also right. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.</span> This is statement. <span class="Italic">Bhramati.</span> It is never discussed, <span class="Italic">sthira.</span> Fixed up means <span class="Italic">sthira. Bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.</span> And that is also... That movement is also within the time limit fixed up by Kṛṣṇa: "Morning, half past six, you get up." "Yes." You cannot stop it. Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">ājñā.</span> It is order of Kṛṣṇa. You stop it, you scientists. You make it conveniently. Not half past six, make it eight. Can you do this? You rascal, you are claiming scientist. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā.</span> It is only by His order you can... You ask him to rise from this side. Why from this side? Is there any scientist can change? Then why they are claiming that there is no God? Huh? What is the answer? Hm? <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā.</span> There is some arrangement. What is their answer? Hm? Jagadīśa Prabhu? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There is no... We don't see how God is working. We don't see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Are you blind? God is working. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati.</span> <span class="Italic">Yasya,</span> by His order he is rising. Why don't you see God? It is not your order or your scientist order. Somebody's order. That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But there doesn't seem to be any meaning. There doesn't seem to be any meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There is no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It's just evolution. There's no meaning. What's the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow what is the meaning. The sun is rising half past six, exactly at the time. So there is no meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We can't tell what the meaning is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Because you are rascal, you do not know. You learn it. One who knows the meaning. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are fool, rascal. How can you know the meaning? You must have to go to the real person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Who knows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru. Therefore we go to guru. <span class="Italic">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is actually serious about inquiring, he must go. <span class="Italic">Guruṁ prapadyeta.</span> Must surrender to guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> <span class="Italic">Śābde pare ca niṣṇātam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That is... Therefore there is guru. <span class="Italic">Ādau gurvāśrayam.</span> If you know, want to know, first of all take shelter of guru. That is the injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Then we will ask, how do we know who is really guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another rascaldom. You see how others are taking guru, <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. You are rascal. You will place so many questions. But the answers are already there. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> Guru is he who knows Kṛṣṇa, who explains Kṛṣṇa. That is guru. Otherwise he's not guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Anyone who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, who knows Kṛṣṇa, he is guru. Otherwise all rascals. Why should you go to a rascal? Immediately you can understand he is guru who has fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. He is guru. Others? They are all rascals. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is under these four groups: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span> They may talk of so much knowledge, but they are rascal fools because they have not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. All the Māyāvādīs, they are all rascals. They have not surrendered. This is the test. Why don't you take lesson from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? He is guru. One who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, one is servant of Kṛṣṇa, he is guru. That is the test. If you want to select a guru, you have to see "Whether this person is fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?" Then he is guru. Huh? What is the definition of guru given by...? Why don't you read all these things? Why you remain fools and rascals? Why...? We are following Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā.</span> You become a guru. How? <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> That's a guru. Why don't you see all these instructions? And you are presenting yourself as following Caitanya Mahāprabhu? Why? Answer. Why you remain fool and rascal? If you want to remain fool and rascal and question, that is not very good. You must know who is guru. And you say, "I do not know who is guru." Why? Hm? What is the answer? Guru is defined by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We are chanting daily, <span class="Italic">śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī advaita gadādhara śrī...</span> Take their lesson. Otherwise why you are praying, <span class="Italic">śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda</span>? You, rather, glorify Hitler or Mussolini. Make them guru. Everything is there. You cannot say that "I do not understand." Do not understand means you do not take. What is the...? All right? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> You are giving one version of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but there are so many versions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> You are giving one version of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but there are so many versions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can learn one, then your life will be successful for many thousand years. Hm? <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> You simply understand one verse of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>; then you understand everything. This is the meaning. <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I remember once you said, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that it took Arjuna less than forty-five minutes. He understood. But for us it is taking, for materialistic men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-five thousand years. (laughter) Who is therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span>? Intelligent men can answer, understand everything, in a minute. And if he's a fool, rascal, even forty-five thousand years he cannot understand. We are giving the best service to the whole world, trying to make them educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> [break] ...very curious: "What is the power and mystery of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, how he is doing so many things but yet he does not appear like these others yogis who are..., like Satya Sai Baba who is making magic and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why? Because they have no eyes. Has Satya Sai Baba so many properties all over the world? He is creating gold but has he got so many properties? One property like this? Huh? I started this business with forty rupees; now it is forty <span class="Italic">crores.</span> Has this rascal has any property like this? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He is producing ashes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Just like Yogi Bhajan came, remember Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Berkeley, and he said, "I am simply here to try and understand how you are doing so greatly, how you are opening so many temples." He said, "I have simply come to try and understand that point, to learn your secret."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But his idea is that he will then sit and enjoy all of those things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Nowadays all these yogis and swamis are going. Even that blind saintly person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Gange...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gangesvarananda. He also went. But coming back, he is disappointed. Nobody took care of him. Although in India he is known as a great saintly person. They have no asset. They have no Kṛṣṇa; therefore they are beggars. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> If one gets Kṛṣṇa, then he gets everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Therefore we pray, <span class="Italic">"viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhūtale, śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-padāya. Viṣṇu-pādāya.</span> (pronounces with long "a") The Prabhupāda and <span class="Italic">Viṣṇupāda,</span> the same thing. Viṣṇu is <span class="Italic">prabhu. Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.</span> They say like that? Who says that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Oh, that, how they are trying to understand your powers? Oh, yes, in one college I was lecturing in Kansas. Some students came to me, and they said, "We are amazed." They were disciples of this one bogus yogi. I cannot remember his name. And they were asking me, "How your swami, how your guru has got some power, we are trying to understand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I told them, "Yes, even we may be unwilling, still, we are forced to serve Kṛṣṇa by his grace and mercy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And even the students are asking. That means it has become widespread, if the small boys are asking. They are also studying. So why did you not say, "You are asking why he has become so famous, and still, you do not say more than other yogis? You are asking this question, 'How he has become?' That means he has already become more than. So why you are asking this question?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think you are the only real resident of Bhāratavarṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> You are the only real resident of Bhāratavarṣa. No one else has fulfilled that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least historically it be proved. [break] ...cause of envy of my Godbrothers. I was known. Although they knew that Prabhupāda liked me very much, because I am <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> I was known as <span class="Italic">pacā-gṛhastha. Pacā-gṛhastha</span> means a rotten <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> And now they say, "This <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> has come out more than us? What is this?" [break] Śrīdhara Mahārāja's chief disciple...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Gaura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He always used to say to Śrīdhara Mahārāja that "You are seeing Abhay Babu as <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> but he is more than many yogis." He was telling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> they were my tenant. So, and he used to say. And then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He knew. He saw you in your activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he said that "Mahārāja, you are seeing he is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He is more than many yogis." He used to say, that boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has good sentiment, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya, yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> It doesn't matter whether one is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> or a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> (Bengali) [break]...all big, big men, he was present. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, another twenty thousand dollars was transferred. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot complain. There is money; there is men; now you have to complete. You cannot say, "For this purpose, it..." No. [break] ...Mādhava Mahārāja, you can say that "Have you seen ever twenty thousand at a time?" And I am bringing daily twenty thousand. Twenty thousand dollars. Not money..., rupees, but dollars. "Have you seen twenty thousand dollars at a time?" [break] Detroit temple, you know? Jagadīśa? Are you going to negotiate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Where is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Detroit, the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, yes, Detroit temple, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he was asking 350,000. So I told, "All right, you take cash, 300,000," and he immediately accepted, though I had not three paisa even in the bank. So immediately... The girl has paid?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She agreed to pay half and our Ambarīṣa agreed to pay half. It was purchased immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cash. And you only had three paisa. That means one who is servant of the richest, he also becomes rich. You always said, "Serving the greatest, you become great."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. A big man's son squanders money and the father pays. Similarly, if you become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, the father will spend for you. Why do you care wherefrom money comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Just like, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you had Dai Nippon print fifty thousand dollars in books in the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Yes. Yes. I gave him five thousand and I ordered him fifty-two thousand. And I told him, "The money will come." And he said that "Five thousand he is giving advance. Money will come." So they immediately published <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, forty thousand dollar worth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And they told me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, later, that that was the first time in the history of their company that they would ever make any such concession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They told?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. Mr. Ogata and Mr. Kugimoto said, "Somehow by his... He is such a great man, His Divine Grace, somehow we accepted." They were surprised. Remember when he went?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were mystified by you, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I was coming back from America at that time, I came via Japan for this purpose. At that time you were in charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your dealings with them were very memorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They said, "How we agreed?" (laughs) They were surprised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And whenever I would see the president... That one meeting you had with him... Whenever I would see the president after that, he would always ask me, "How is His Divine Grace? How is he feeling and where is he?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I challenged him, "You are Buddhist." "Yes." "You are eating meat?" "Yes." "What is this?" (laughs) That was my first talking with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They were wanting to talk business for a long time. You were simply preaching to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the Kazi. His first question was that "What kind of religion you are following? You are killing your father and mother?" This was His beginning of the talk. "What kind of religion it is?" "How is that? I am killing my father, mother?" "Yes, cow is your mother and bull is your father. You are killing them. The bull is giving you grains by working in the field, and the mother is giving you milk, and you are killing them." This was his first question. So this is a civilization of killing father and mother. All over the world they are killing bulls and cows. In England there is law that you can maintain a cow but you cannot maintain a bull. It must be killed. Yes. When I was a guest in John Lennon's house the manager in charge, he was telling me. "You cannot keep bull. This is our law." I learned from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Only for breeding purposes. Only for breeding. All the rest are killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is law in England? So you cannot keep even bull privately. Must be killed. This is the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the reason for that law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bull will not supply milk, so there is no use. It must be killed. Otherwise they are ferocious animal. You have made this law. The cows may be given some time to be killed, but the bulls should be killed immediately. This is their law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nor do the farmers actually want to keep them anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are useless animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply expensive. But here in India they know how to utilize bulls-for transportation, for plowing and so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Such a shortage of fuel, but there is no shortage of fuel with a bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, rather, it will supply you <span class="Italic">gobar,</span> fuel. Whatever he will eat, he will give you fuel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But now the government is trying to teach the people that they should buy tractors and kill the calves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They want to have..., make tractors popular and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kill the bulls. They were criticizing us because in our <span class="Italic">gośālā</span> we maintain the male calves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when our Harikeśa was struck by a bull and he was taken in the hospital, the doctor was criticizing, "If you have killed the bulls, then this condition would not have come to you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. <span class="Italic">Karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There will be no accident because this..., the acci...You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard about the accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was some accident, and he was taken to hospital. So he was advised, "Because you do not kill the bulls, therefore this is the accident." As if without killing..., by killing the bulls there is no accident. And they do not cite the accident by motorcar, greater bulls. Accident will be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yesterday we planted paddy, paddy field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That's nice. But this is going to be a lawn?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. It will have flower bushes and <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> around after the construction. The botanical director suggested that on the one end we make a little arbor type covering of vine that Your Divine Grace could sit there and give lecture from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And the devotees could sit on the lawn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very nice. Mr. Agarwal said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Not Mr. Agarwal. Mr. Mitra, the deputy director of the botanical gardens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He came out here and gave one design. From Howrah Botanical Garden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He is the in-charge? Superintendent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. He came with his wife and family. They were very pleased. He stayed for a day or so and then made a whole plan for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Sun is moving-that <span class="Italic">uttarāyaṇam</span> and <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇāyanam.</span> This <span class="Italic">ayanam</span> means <span class="Italic">gamanam.</span> Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Northern and southern course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is mention, when yogis<span class="Italic">...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere it is ment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> <span class="Italic">Agnir jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ ṣaṇ-māsā uttarāyaṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. [break] ...line there will be pillars? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Arches. Just like on your veranda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, arches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Exact same pattern. It will keep the same pattern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> But on this one time should we bathe directly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can bathe <span class="Italic">śālagrāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Bathe <span class="Italic">śālagrāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bathe the <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-śilā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Place Him... Place the Deity there and <span class="Italic">śālagrāma</span> in front of Them and then bathe <span class="Italic">śālagrāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...made so gigantic and so opulent. And we make Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gate? How foolish they are. The doorkeeper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I challenged them that "Why you are putting Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gateway?" So they say, "Well, this was in memory because when..." They say when Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was a magistrate that he used to go there and he used to watch the local people do their..., do some sports and horse-racing and things, and so as memory they are making there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are so intelligent, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was not so intelligent that he could place him. But you are so very intelligent, you are surpassing Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. So you are intelligent or fool? You should answer like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jumping over guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Monkey's business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He could not understand where Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura should be placed. You have understood. You are so intelligent, overintelligent. That means rascals. Overintelligent means rascal. Bhaktisiddhānta Ṭhākura, he remained so many years and he could not understand. You have understood to make Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura a gatekeeper. You tell him next time when you..., that "You are overintelligent." [break] ...statue of..., picture, I think, of Bhakti... That Sakhi Babu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which <span class="Italic">bābu</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sakhi Babu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, Sakhi Babu, he is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Opposite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means he is on the same level. [break] ...Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gate is the proof how fool he is. He has not shown respect to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura; he has disgraced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now the government is saying that they have to knock down those temples because of the encroaching on the roadside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now where Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Will go now? What was... What was your guru mahārāja's plan for where he...? I don't understand. I mean, did your guru mahārāja want a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's statue was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivinoda... Because it was their... My guru mahārāja never tried to bring him here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they did it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's picture was there, not that on the gateway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> In the back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should have taken away that building which was constructed, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and placed him there as separate temple. You see? That red... That was constructed by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean that school building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No, no, in the back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just on the side of the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Old building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If they wanted to show some respect they should have installed him there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just next to the temple. Your guru mahārāja did not build because there was something already in Svarūpa Gañja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why don't they be satisfied...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are bigger than Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not their position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Overintelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember one time Kārttikeya Mahārāja was chanting to a picture of Bhaktisiddhānta. You chastised him and said, "What is your connection with Bhaktisiddhānta? Your connection is with me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> You did. I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When Kārttikeya Mahārāja was chanting to your guru mahārāja's picture, you said, "How you can connect with him? Your connection is with me." (end)</div>
