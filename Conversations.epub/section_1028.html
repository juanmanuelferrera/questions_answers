<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> They have not given you phone number of this place. I was not in idea that they had shifted you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Tejas did not tell you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> And therefore I have phoned and phoned and phoned, but I was not getting anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When was this? Long time ago?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> No. Yesterday. Because yesterday I was to come here. But I was called by Mr. Brahmānanda and he told me that you have come here (indistinct) so that I want to know something (indistinct). One question was put up in Rājya-sabhā and he's (indistinct) there. I told him that he's full of (indistinct). There are some gentlemen of er..., labor minister and from (indistinct) Andhra Pradesh. They were also there. (indistinct) Mr. D. D. Desai is also there. (indistinct) And we have discussed at length. And we have told them and there is no restriction (indistinct) the size and to everybody. And you see then it is in Indian history, it is first time that something has been done. All people are saying that they have done in America, they have done in so many centers all over the world and then we are, something like that, it is shameful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Indian culture. Then he told me that you are perfectly right and I am also an Indian and I have that right also that we have no knowledge about all these things. If you have something then you please let us know so that we may inquire the particular matter. And I told him that you inquire first and then why I should have to inquire. Why I have? There is no matter, no anything, then how can I give the order for inquiry. On what basis? Let the something come, then I will... And I told them that why you are harassing? This sign, this sign, all these things, this passport, and in all these things, and you say that you go over and, Why you are...? Visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Visa. Why you are harassing? I will check up. And you write me a letter so that I may call the consultant on the visas so that I may discuss it. And at length there was a discussion and that was refuted because there were two, three gentlemen, personalities from Andhra, they also supported.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda addressed the whole Andhra Pradesh cabinet in Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was invited by the...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Illustrated Weekly is atheistic. Khushwant Singh, the editor, openly told us that "I don't believe in God." But Tanyug(?) is religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> We don't mind for that. We will give. And each will write and sign. (indistinct) And if you don't mind I will give one suggestion more. In the Indian national interest, in this country's interest, that I should prepare some interested members to see all over the world, our, this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be very nice.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got branches in almost all important cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Ten or fifteen. Let them see so that they may be attracted and they may know each and every thing. Because here we know only by this thing. And then let us advertise about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You take this paper. Make a list of important cities. Now suppose if you go from Delhi. So you can go first to Paris, Geneva, Rome, then London, Amsterdam, Stockholm. Then from London I think New York, Boston, Montreal, Canada. Then you go to the western side, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver. Go further, Honolulu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then you could go to the Pacific, Australia.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So when can they organize this tour? How soon can it be organized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> I'll ask them. I have an idea about that only. Because yesterday Mr. Brahmānanda already told me that "Why not you people also stand up and say something about that." Why not you strengthen my hands. Because they press and press and they want something that I should say something. So if you people stand and then you say that "No no no no, this is not the thing and we have seen it and this and this and that and that." And they will be... That is his idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the only people who are pressing charges are the Communists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> But they will do. That is their duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Yes. So that why we should mind for that? That is there. You may say they're <span class="Italic">rākṣasa,</span> or whatever you... (laughs) They will, always they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Rākṣasas</span> are always ready to kill God. That was the business of Rāvaṇa, that was the business of Kaṁsa, that was the business of Hiraṇyakaśipu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is the same thing in Rāvaṇa and this... What is this? That is the same thing. They were happy, they were drink and all these things, and take and all that time, and also harassing the devotees and... This is their duty. This is their duty. Therefore we should not mind for that. Let them do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, even Russia, which is Communist, has admired Prabhupāda's books. I have written reviews. I was in Russia two months ago. They're praising Prabhupāda's books very much. The leading professors there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Also, this is a part of nowadays. Advertise and all these things, to know each and every thing. This is correct that why you are worrying about all these things. People should know it about you. Why not hear it? This is perfectly right, I agree with you. But in the interest of other people who have faith in their religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our mission is that this Kṛṣṇa cult should be preached all over the world. That is the... <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> (indistinct) Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">. Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that the one, "There's no one more dear to me than..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even in black Africa Prabhupāda has temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Yes, that is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I said even in black Africa you have temples and devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> You must circulate these all things. At least to our members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Where is the verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you print the opinions? Several times...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, I have it. We have printed the reviews in all, and the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Consciousness is Authorized.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a simple thing, but all the reviews you should print them in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In a book form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are hundreds of reviews.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> And you should also supply that to at least your interested members. Interested Parliament only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll design a special booklet just for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am asking you for so many months that you publish all these opinions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have all the opinions, but we presently have them in sheets. Not in a book form. We can put it in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that? Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the sheets? Oh, I have. Yes I have most of the reviews, book reviews, with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, where is that? Bring it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati<br class="calibre2"/>bhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā<br class="calibre2"/>mām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg 18.68]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me." Read the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda: "Generally it is advised that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will neither understand Kṛṣṇa nor <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. Those who do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is should not try to explain <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> whimsically and become offenders. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (reads newspaper headlines:) "(indistinct) Ungodly face of Kṛṣṇa."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> O.K. So before 5th I will give some good papers for that... giving our names also. In our name. These articles will be published in our name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want us to give you an article on ISKCON? A brief article? Or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> No, you don't give the article. You give only that and this thing. Then we will give. In Hindi also and in English and Gujarati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We will do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> (Hindi) They don't want anything. They say that religious is a opium. So that what you are doing (indistinct). They are not (indistinct). If they are in power then they can do like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They did it in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Because their theory is this: That this God and all these religious matters, this is a opium and this is a kind of, you may say it that in the umbrella. Religious in the name of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what they have done, the Communists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> They have not done anything. They should not do anything. It is not their duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say, countries like Russia and China, what actual progress they have made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is... They say like that, that we are giving very good food to everybody, very good house, and living, and all their (indistinct), education, medical free. We are giving the to common men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Medical (indistinct) is free. Free medical service, education... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...and in the offices of big, big professors and all, it looks so much lower than in America or Canada.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> And in the comparison of India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, in some respects I found them even lower than India. You'll be amazed... I visited all the leading libraries of Russia and Leningrad. Moscow University Library, all the big libraries. These libraries don't have any foreign exchange for ordering these books. They all want to order... They were begging me for free books. They said, "Why don't you give us a donation or exchange." They have a book exchange that if they give their books then we give our books. Each library gets such little foreign exchange allowance to buy books from abroad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A taxi driver, he was asking some <span class="Italic">bhakshish</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> In Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I was talking with Professor Katovsky. I asked him please call for a taxi. So he said, "Swamiji, it is Moscow." That means taxis are not available. Then he came down with me and from the gate he showed me, "You take this shortcut when you go to your hotel." He could not call a taxi. Taxis are not available. He said, "Oh, it is Moscow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But even the taxi drivers are very corrupt because of the shortage of taxis in Russia. You have to stand in line for taxis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not taxi, bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even for taxis they have no taxi stands where you stand in line. So the taxi driver, he will park his car a little bit away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In my opinion it is a poor country. I think poorer than India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> They have advertised only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have good propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people are not happy. They are terrorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is correct. That is correct. In Parliament we are telling that they are a first-class prisoner. First-class prison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First-class prisoners. Not first-class, third-class. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I was told, because a lot of people in Russia who are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa also. It's very... There's a lot of corruption. Even the taxi drivers are corrupt. They'll park their taxi a bit away then come and approach you when you are standing in a line and say, "Okay, I'll take you there," but he'll tell you three times the price because everyone's waiting in such a long line for a taxi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Black market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And one friend of ours told us what they do because all the cars belong to the state, a lot of taxis, the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> The taxis are not independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they all belong to the state. But the driver, if he makes extra money, that goes in his pocket and they have tipping also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are always anxious to get extra. Buses are not very good. Third-class buses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And a lot of people want foreign exchange there. Like they'll ask...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> I'm going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You're going to Russia? When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Yes, on 4th of October.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For how long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> About fifteen days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Visit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Budapest also. Because I am not Communist and I'm not supporting also Communist. Therefore they have not told that he should not be sent there. Told me. But due to some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are going to just Budapest? That is Hungary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Hungary, yes. Hungary then Moscow. Then Moscow, Leningrad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good. Actually I can give you a book from Leningrad if you wish to... This is from Moscow if you want to read it. It's all about Moscow. These are of course the good pictures of Moscow. You wish to have it? I can give it to you. This is on Moscow. I also have one on Leningrad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> I will take after lunch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is a letter from the biggest library in Russia to Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. They have ordered some books, and they want the remaining books but they wanted free, in exchange. But they don't have the money. They want all of Prabhupāda's books but they don't have the money so they want in exchange. This is from the biggest library in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Our economy is something good at this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Indian economy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Indian economy is better. Income tax also they have got 67% more. Because they have reduced the rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the percentage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Before that the percentage is 97 but last year, is 1976, in the March they have reduced the income tax from 97 to 65. 67.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America it is 25.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> No, not 25, that is 45... But there is a system in West Germany that if you earn more, the tax will be less. That is their system. If people will earn 200 crores, then the tax percentage will be lower. Lower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good. That is good. The psychology is that if you earn more and government will tax more, then the impetus for earning more is cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Therefore they have got no black money. And here the system is different. If you will earn more then you will have to pay more. It means people are not as interested in earning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore what is the use of earning? What is the use of earning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is true. Then I will get all the replies and papers today. And I will arrange each and every thing before 5th or 6th of September.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You leave here the 6th?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Oh no. I will leave today or tomorrow. But I will come and I will arrange all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When are you coming back here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> I will come back on 5th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. So I'll meet you on the 5th then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> No, I will ring you here. You give me the telephone number. No, we don't mind for them. We will crush them for all these things. They can't speak like that. If they will speak in India, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thing, general thing, that I am writing books and selling in foreign countries and I'm bringing the money here. It is for India's sake(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> But somebody should tell in the House all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can tell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is the thing only. That is the point of Mr. Brahmānanda Reddy also. Yesterday he told me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the important point that my books are sold daily sixty thousand dollars all over the world. I have made the Trust so all the collections should be divided fifty percent for constructing temple and fifty percent for reprinting books. So we don't take a paisa profit. So far as an author, they are selling sixty thousand dollars. And even if I would have taken ten percent royalty then it would have been six thousand dollars. Six thousand dollars means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hundred and eighty thousand dollars a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no no. Six thousand dollars means, say ten rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Sixty thousand per day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty thousand per day. Actually. But we are all foregoing it for pushing on this movement, and if we bring that money and construct big, big temple or planetarium, what is the harm to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda is bringing in more foreign exchange than even big business export concerns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm bringing regularly not less than ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Sending to India. We must tell them all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You tell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is the thing. This is the Brahmānanda... I already told yesterday that some members must be briefed and they must tell something so that my hands may be strengthened and so that I may...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a great credit that I am selling my books and bringing ten lakhs of rupees from foreign country in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That we will speak. And his mind is very clear. Brahmānanda his mind is very clear, very clear, and he is appreciating. And he is in our favor 100%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even not in our favor. I am working hard in foreign countries and bringing money to India. You should give us some credit. But instead of giving credit, I am being criticized in the Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> They are putting like this. They are putting this case like that, that foreign money is coming here to advertise the American embassies, like that. They are that talking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may talk nonsense, but this is the fact. This is the fact. I have got my Book Trust Fund and I've advised regularly to send eight <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per month. That is being spent in Bombay, in... I'm not collecting from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if an Indian brings from foreign country by his labor eight <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per month, how much credit he should be given? He should be recognized. But instead of recognizing they are criticizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> This is their way, sir. They have to. They must do it. Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you kindly speak to the Parliament that "This is the position, that he is working day and night..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Oh no, I will speak very high about this. Let them, let the matter come. And if not come then we will take this matter. I will give the question. You please reply how much money is coming and in what way they are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> I will ask the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prove that the American government is supplying some way. No. We are selling our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually when you go abroad you can even see how our income's coming. How our temples live. We are all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our books are being printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> A very big thing it is. It is marvelous that you have done such a thing. It is proud of India that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> New York devotees just got a twelve story building right in the center and I know the local Hindus they are trying to build a small temple since twenty years and they're not succeeding. And right in the center of New York we have a twelve story building. Now all the Hindus are coming to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got that picture New York temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Ratha-yātrā picture? Ratha-yātrā, the New York paper. <span class="Italic">New York Times, Newsweek</span>, all the Indians came. They said, "East Meets West."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now who has converted so many of... This is one party. (refers to <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> going on nearby) Hundreds of parties like this, they are engaged in <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> India government is sending so many professional dancers by paying them from the cultural department and what I am getting? Not a single farthing. And still I am bringing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Ah, Indian culture is... You... Nobody has done these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Ratha-yātrā festival, where is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, the news of Ratha-yātrā. "New York Celebrates Festival of Chariots." Even at the U.N. conference we were there. They welcomed Vedic... We presented a Vedic reply to the U.N. conference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherever possible we are presenting Vedic culture, Indian culture. And I have no support from the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Let us have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And a professional dancer is going and the government is paying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'd like you to take this because this also has an article at length about our Gurukula system in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless they are appreciating this culture, how they are accepting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> It is perfectly right. But they must do it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will do. Do it... We can give you all information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That I will speak each and every thing. I will give a speech about all these things in any way. I have got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This one is later. Just came. This is a new sample copy that we have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> And what is your program, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My program is chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and write books. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> No, no, now. Staying in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am going to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomorrow. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> And you are staying at Vṛndāvana up to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we can arrange a bus and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> You will arrange for bus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them go. They have got their cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> They have their car also and they have got this <span class="Italic">Taj</span> and all these trains. Why you arrange? Let them spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I wanted to work in India by spreading <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> provided I get little cooperation of the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That we will talk. That we will talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One cooperation is that we can bring immediately a small vans or buses so that we can go village to village, town to town. If I get government permit then... Because here the buses are very costly, and at the same time they are not very good. But foreign buses... India hasn't got to pay anything but simply let us have and work in India. This much facility wanted. Besides that, our men, they are coming, spending ten thousand rupees and after three months or six months, "Get out, get out, get out." And Indians are not joining. Indians are not so sacrificing. But these boys they have sacrificed everything. I am sure if some cooperation is coming from the government I can very soon change the face of India. But I am not getting any facilities. We have experimented in Bengal, and here also, he is also going, <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party. But he could not do it in a large scale for want of facilities. And in foreign countries these boys are so sacrificing spirit, as soon as we give him some program, immediately they make arrangement. Immediately. We are going village to village with books in buses. Hundreds of buses are working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America, in Europe. They have got facilities, full facilities. And government appreciates. Some of the governments they have given public holiday of the Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> This is from the Mayor of San Francisco proclaiming that Ratha-yātrā is a public holiday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, fifty thousand people come every year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this time, New York, the government, the police, they appreciated that this kind of dancing, it is not artificial. So here is life. They appreciated. What the American boys have got to dance for Kṛṣṇa unless it is from the heart? They are not dancing dogs that I have trained them and they are dancing. So there are so many things to be done in India but I am, without getting any cooperation, I am getting opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Quite. Now let us, we must be active. We must be active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be good for the country, for the whole nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> And we will come Vṛndāvana also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Please come. I am there for three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> How many rupees per day for three days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have about a thirty-room guest house in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> You bring eighty persons with you, make nice arrangements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want sir, that is charge. We charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is... You must charge it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Our charges are very nominal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A donation to that temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is perfectly correct. You must charge. If your members will get free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes. Each room has a fan, bath...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> That is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think air-conditioned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some rooms are air-conditioned, two or three...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far as your governor Reddy, he went. He stayed there two days. He has certified... He sent me a recent letter, you'll be surprised. Ask Harikeśa to bring that letter. Latest letter from Chatterjee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> No I have seen that. I have seen that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Latest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Latest. Also I heard that this Channa Reddy, Governor of the U.P.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's one of our <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us cooperate. You'll see how I can change the face of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Let us train some members also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is the only platform where real United Nations can be made. That is practical. That is practical. That United Nation has failed. If this Indian culture... I have given this philosophy to the American students. <span class="Italic">Andha-paṅgu-nyāya.</span> That a lame man and a blind man, separately, both of them are useless. But when they combine together, the lame man is taken on the shoulder of the blind man, and the lame man has got eyes but he has no legs. He gives direction and the blind man goes. So the, at the present moment I am trying to spread this movement all over the world. But we have no means. So let America supply the money, and let them take our direction for the culture. That will be United Nation. And actually it will become. How they are dancing, black, white, Indian, American, European, in Ratha-yātrā? There is no politics. It is out of really spiritual ecstasy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Ah, what is politics?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the real platform of United Nation. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> At that time <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu. Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> They have no demand. These boys they are working so hard. They never ask a single paisa from me. It is not possible for me to pay these foreigners as salaried man. That is not possible. They get minimum four thousand rupees minimum. Minimum salary America is $400 dollars. That means four thousand rupees. So and they are getting $800, $1200, $2000. And poverty is unknown in America. They do not know what is poverty. I see here the milk they are standing in block. You can get as much milk as you want anywhere you go, any shop you go you take immediately. Anything. Building materials. You simply order to the suppliers, immediately everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Ah, but here there are so many difficulties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here simply difficulties. In comparison to other countries, I have seen that it is simply difficulty. Frankly speaking. And to speak more frankly, why there is emergency? Emergency means bad government. Otherwise, there is no necessity of emergency. Emergency proves the government is not going nice. Is it not? Why emergency? If it is normally going on nicely then where is the question of emergency?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Emergency means there is something unnormal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If it is normal there is no question of emergency. That is the proof. Another thing, personally, from the Vedic point of view, I don't think India is ready to take actually democracy. Mass of people, they do not care for politics. You have better experience. There, in other countries, even a small man, he has got political sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Ah, but they are educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But here, mass of people, they do not know what is politics. One gentleman, he was my friend, it was in 1952 or '53, Mr. Datt. He was a statistics man. So he was going in the villages to take some statistics. He said to me: "In the village, they ask me, '<span class="Italic">Bābujī, iṁrej kakhan...</span> (in Bengali asking "When will the English return?')." So (Hindi). The mass of people, they're for foreigners' rule: "Come and rule over us." Because the mass of people they have no sense of politics. Anyone may come and let them rule, we don't mind. Whatever little tax you want, you take, that's all right. The mass of people is like that. They are not concerned in politics. Under the circumstances, a democracy is not suitable for India. Long ago that Lord Curzon, he suggested this, that in India monarchy is better. He suggested that some of the royal family members should become King of India. It will be welcome. And our country, all along this monarchy was there. Democracy is idea now, but the monarch up to Parīkṣit Mahārāja, they were ideal, <span class="Italic">rājarṣi.</span> People have so much faith in the monarch that whatever he does, it is right. <span class="Italic">Naradeva.</span> Of course, nowadays things have changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> There is no difference. In the name of democracy this is the same thing. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, democracy means the people must have political sense. Then democracy is there. If the people have no political sense, artificially they are giving vote, that democracy... Anyway, we are not political man, but so far whatever it may be, to change the present situation, I am confident if this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is taken seriously in India there will be very, very good thing. That is absolute. So we can take up this work provided there is little cooperation from the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Krishna Modi:</span> Correct. So I will come to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
