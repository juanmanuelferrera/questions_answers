<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...you say everything is created, he is created, this rascal who is saying there is no creator, he's also created. So where he gets this idea, there is no creator?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His mentality is that of an animal. So less intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal also knows that he's created by another dog. Otherwise why the little, what is called, cab, puppy, goes up to the mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They don't have..., the reason they don't have an idea is because before you came to America, the understanding of the science of God was presented on a kindergarten level, the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> So it did not satisfy their scientific mind. So because before you came to give them the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> they had not information, and they did not accept the Christian version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from Christian or Hindu, the general mass of people, how they can say that there is no creator? From common sense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are accepting authority, and so they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from authority, from practical experience....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...how one can...? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣabhadeva:</span> They are trying to avoid their responsibility to that creator. They don't want to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can avoid the creator, but you cannot say there is no creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It means they're totally ignorant, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You accept the authority of the creator or not, that is your business. But you cannot say there is no creator. Just like there are many outlaws. They say also, "We don't care for the government."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there is a government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is a government. You don't like or don't care, that is your business, but there is a government. How you can deny it? That we shall see later on, how you can neglect government. But there is a government. You have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think it is just in the last few hundred years that these scientists have been given so much prestige and they're making so much propaganda. It's just a recent thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, formerly it was not such a great majority of people who thought like this; it was just a few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to challenge all these rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are giving us the weapons with which to challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Transcendental knowledge. Now the Russians will fall also if our books are introduced there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If actually they are after something reality, they must accept. If they are actually after something reality. It is natural. They have been disgusted with this Christianity. Useless, that's all. But if they are actually serious, then they'll accept knowledge. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break]...exhibit of Bharadvāja's in the temple of the Dāmodara and mother Yaśodā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is nicely done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...that he is not my father, that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that the atom is the source of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that the atom, the little particle, is eternal, original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you rascal, you are not coming from atom; you are coming from your father. That is my reply. You rascal, you are coming from your father, not from the atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do you say everything comes from the atom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Originally, they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Originally, go to hell. (laughs) First of all, take your case. "Originally." You do not know your case and you are going to originally. <span class="Italic">Hele data nakhe yuce.(?)</span> You know this philosophy? <span class="Italic">Hele,</span> there was some water snake, they have no poison. One snake charmer, he cannot catch even that. And he's trying to catch cobra. So first of all answer your case, then go to "originally."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's what you said yesterday in discussing that philosopher Skinner. He said first we control nature, then we can control ourselves. And you replied, if you can't control yourself, how you can control such a big thing like nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the defect. They are tiny, insignificant creature and talking big, big things. This is the defect of modern civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like a child trying to catch the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has no importance, and he's talking big, big things. The same philosophy. <span class="Italic">Hele data bai nakhe yuce.(?)</span> He cannot catch even nonpoisonous snake, and he's saying, "I'll catch up a cobra."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like a small child trying to catch the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) All these rascals should be approached that, first, "Whether you have come from your.... Is your father monkey? You say that from monkey man has come. You have come from monkey or from your father?" Ask him this question. Naturally he will be ashamed to say "Yes, I have come from some monkey." (laughs) Unless he is a great fool, he will not say it. Then your father comes from his father, from his father.... Where the monkey comes? Is there in the history of your family that your forefather...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we are studying the bones. That's what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are digging up bones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also they cannot say, because we Hindus, we burn the bones. Where you get the bones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but there's some groups that did not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, some group, not. As a general practice, all Hindus they burn, from time immemorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I mean, there are other people in other parts of the world, like in Africa, they found bones from five million years ago, and they say that it's the missing link bones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Missing, why missing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well they couldn't figure it out until they found these bones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they couldn't. Still, he says. Just see, he has brought as if he was dog, the rascal. The dog is prohibited. Man is.... [break] (walk continues on beach) ...They have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Other theories</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Theories?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists or philosophers, their only business is to defy God. All demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Actually, Prabhupāda, the people are turning away from the scientists now, because they have seen that their promises have not brought anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And simply, if we can expose that they never went to the moon planet, their life will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya, haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How can we expose that, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To expose.... They could not answer this simple question, why Sunday first and Monday second? They could not understand, these rascals, I have asked so many. Can you answer this? Can you answer, can any of you, why Sunday first? All over the world, they accept Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday last. Why? Answer this. Is there anyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> What is the answer, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The answer is sun planet first, then moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the sun planet is ninety-three million miles, and according to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> the moon is 1,600,000 miles away from sun. So I have calculated the other day that it takes ninety days, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, six or seven months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six or seven months it takes to go to the moon planet. How they have gone in four days? They have never gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How did you get that calculation, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How did you make that calculation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calculation, they have calculation that sun planet is ninety-three million miles from, that is, they have accepted. I also accept it. I say the moon planet is 1,600,000 miles still further. So you cannot go to the sun planet, how can go to the moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Today is the day of scandals. These days, there are so many scandals in the United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask them. If they say moon planet is first, why not Monday first? Why Sunday first? That's a fact. Sun planet first, then moon, then Mars. <span class="Italic">Ravi, Soma, Maṅgala, Bhū.</span> That is the calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means that all the countries are cooperating together to cheat the people, because they're all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They have taken from the Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, they are right, Sunday, Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I mean to say that everyone is saying that they have gone to the moon, that means they are all together cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The scientists have got radiotelescopes. They bounce the sound vibration off the planet, and depending on how long it takes the sound to come back, that's how far away it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They bounce sound vibration off a planet, and depending on how long it takes the vibration to come back, that's how far away the planet is. So they've calculated the sun to be further in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, answer why Sunday first. Then talk of all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Mars is after the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Mars is after the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Because in French, Tuesday is the word for Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Saturday is last. Saturn is last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Each planet is 1,600,000 miles away from one another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 1,600,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They say they went 250,000 miles twice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, let them say, first of all answer "Why Sunday first?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about these pictures we have seen on the television showing them jumping on the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can make in laboratory. That is not very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Colossal hoax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> ...pictures are like the King Kong movie.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In King Kong movie they made cotton as cloud. (laughs). They can do everything in the laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They are making that movie again, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Spending millions to make it again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which movie?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> King Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have got some gigantic King Kong figure. It moves like a gigantic doll. Actually, to make a movie now they spend maybe ten, fifteen million dollars for one movie. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot cleanse nowadays?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They made a movie called "2001," and in that they had shots of men on different planets. It looked just like the moon shots. It was very..., just the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, it is very difficult to convince the people that they have not gone to the moon. I mean, that's a good logic, but they'll think that's very childish for us to say "Sunday first, Monday."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, let them remain as child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda once said that if the moon is dirt and dust, how is it that it reflects the light of the sun so much that it lights up the whole planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The common sense. They have lost their common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> It's so shiny that it lights up the whole earth planet at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> How can dirt reflect light like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was my first question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that we should write a, we should publish a little book on this, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe one of the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> There are many scientists who agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now our scientists are challenging, Svarūpa Dāmodara and others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They could scientifically publish a book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> There are scientists in England who agree that they didn't go to the planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> There are some scientists in England who agree with you that they did not go to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they did not. Simply propaganda. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] Freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's just like you said in the BTG.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equal rights. The rascal father has left, and poor mother is carrying the burden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> She chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa just by seeing us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. There is no other way. We are the only shelter for these forlorn women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have to give them shelter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, scientists have this theory called use and disuse. They would say that these birds here that have the long beaks for eating fish, originally, they did not have that, but after many, many millions of years of trying to catch fish, gradually their beaks became longer. And they would say that would be the origin of that species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He's saying that because the fish are trying to catch fish, therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The birds are trying to catch the fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Therefore a beak comes out. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, no. That's not the theory. The theory is that the ones with the long beaks are able to catch the fish. Therefore, the other ones die off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Therefore they get the long beaks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Just from mutation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That's not. It's another theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Madness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> It's another theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? So that's all right. If we are eager for Kṛṣṇa, we shall get Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we agree with that theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It has been given by Kṛṣṇa because he always wanted to catch fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They used to give us a simple example at school. They said that the people that lived in Mexico City...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we accept that. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> If, at the time of death, he thinks that "If I would have possessed a beak," then he gets the life. That's all. (laughter) That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say that this is the way the different types of bodies come into being, that by the desire...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we say also. There is no difficulty. Because at the time of death, whatever you are thinking, you'll get the next body. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say, though, that this is how the different bodies come into being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we say also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> But can any body be generated from the imagination, any kind of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not this imagination. I wanted that facility. So my subtle mind is wanting that. So nature is supplying: "All right, you get it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We don't create the bodies. We desire them, and the material nature has created already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Their theory is that these bodies never before existed, but by the desire of the living entity, that certain type of body was created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That means nature is above. He wanted that body; nature has given. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> No, not exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That they want a particular facility, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And nature supplies the body, that's all. Simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they do not put a limit, 8,400,000. They think that it can keep going on increasing, increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let it go on. That's all right. What is wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> By their theory, though, a human being would be able to generate wings or a beak like a bird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are human beings who can fly in the sky. Siddhaloka, Siddhaloka. There is a planet called Siddhaloka. There the human beings from one planet to another go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have wings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No wings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Gandharvas have wings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Why do you need wings if you can fly? Also Garuḍa has a beak. Where are we going now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda said in Hawaii there's no.... (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The old man, her father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I hope so. (pause) [break]...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Send to Svarūpa Dāmodara, he has got also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Monday. Sunday, Monday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Days are in this order. So naturally one has to conclude that sun first, moon second. Naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They will say, "Who has set up the order?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you accept it. All over the world, nobody says that Monday first. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Is this also in Sanskrit language? Sunday, Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. Ask all scientists this simple question. Why, all over the world, Sunday, sun first and moon second? Why? And Saturday last. All of you could not answer this question. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have stumped us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali verse) <span class="Italic">Baḍo baḍo bānare, baḍo baḍo peṭa, laṅkā dingahe manamarā heṅṭa(?).</span> "Big, big monkey, big, big belly. Ceylon jumping, melancholy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We are all big monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> How are they able to perpetuate such an enormous hoax?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Enormous hoax for the fools, not for the intelligent persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They never fooled you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They never fooled you. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> That means that some people must know the actual truth about the hoax in the American system, so if we can find them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are knowing that. State it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In other words, is it, is it that there is deliberate trick? It is deliberate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ahh, it may not be deliberate, but they are fools. They are talking nonsense. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But what about the people, like the men on the ship who say they have jumped on the moon? Are they lying and being paid off, or are they just.... What, I mean what is the actual position? Some men are getting on a television saying, "We landed there, it was like this, it was like that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I saw that television, at that time, the whole thing broke wrong. There was a press representative. He protested. I was protesting from the beginning, but they could not show how they jumped, at the last. Going, going, going, but at the time of jumping, melancholy. Ceylon jumping melancholy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I mean they do, these men who are space travelers, they say "We did land on the moon." Now are they lying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they, but the television was showing. They could not show this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jumping on the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was not shown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> They may be hypnotized also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda said they'd gone to Rāhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have got that dust. They say they got that from another planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dust you can take it from here, from this beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So then they're lying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means they're deliberately cheating, knowingly. And the government is backing them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What is the purpose of the cheating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Prabhupāda said to ask for taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Lābha, pūjā, pratiṣṭhā.</span> These three things are materially wanted. Some material profit, some reputation and some.... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Adoration. These are the material demands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because, originally, it was built up as a big thing between Russia and America, who would get to the moon first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now they are shaking hands, and none of them has gone. "I thank you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's like the emperor's new clothes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "You failed, my dear sir. I failed also. Come on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a story, "The Emperor's Clothes," "The Emperor's New Clothes." There were these tailors, and they made believe that they were making clothes for the emperor, but actually they were doing nothing, but they were making the motions. So they, everybody was saying what nice clothes and finally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> No, they said, any intelligent, only intelligent people will see the clothes. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And someone who's a fool, he cannot see it. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara: </span>Magic cloth. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> So they were getting much money for making nothing. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The emperor went out naked in the street, and everyone was afraid to admit that there was no clothes. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara: B</span>ecause they would be labeled fool. So finally one boy said, "But the emperor has no clothes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is a nice story in this connection. There was one Gopal Ban. So he was very cunning fellow. In the Muhammadan period in Bengal. So the Mohammedan Nawab asked him, "Gopal Ban, can you prepare a <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> in my name?" "Oh, yes!" So, "I'll engage so many <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> and they will make a <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> your activities, your glories, everything. So give me one hundred thousand rupees, just begin." He was taking money, taking money, "Yes, it is going on, going on." "Then when it will be published?" "Yes, just last few days more. Now, sir, everything is prepared. So the one thing is, you have to give me information how many husbands you have got, your wife, huh? How many husbands your wife has got?" That is very insulting. "What, you nonsense, you take." "No, that is the main feature of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> Draupadī had five husbands, so how many husbands your wife has got? Tell me that." Then, "No, no, I don't want that. I am the only husband." "Then how can you write <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span>?" (laughter) "I don't want." "All right. If you want <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> you must tell how many your wife has got husbands." That he cannot say. So <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he kept the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That already, he took that "I have to steal to pay so much money. Give me." That's all right. So these are, scientists are doing like that. At the end, how many husbands your wife has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Scientists are doing the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Taking money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They have one argument, that during solar eclipse, the moon appears to pass in front of the sun, between the sun and the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda explains that. It is the Rāhu planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But they are viewing the moon. The moon is right there, they can see it. And all of a sudden it goes in front of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that? Moon is there, sun is there. Now which first? That is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They will say that they've observed in their telescopes...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll say..., whatever they'll say it is all right. First of all, say why Sunday first. Then talk all nonsense. First of all, answer this. You cannot say "We believe that Sunday first." What is the fact? Why do you bring moon, Monday? Why not bring...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They will say it is arbitrary order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Then they will get back to their argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Arbitrary order is not science. That you cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> How can it be arbitrary if every culture in the history of the planet has accepted that order? How can it be arbitrary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That doesn't matter it's not arbitrary. Do you accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Rādhāvallabha is a rascal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Thirty or forty years also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, one man made a little plaster body of a human being, and he planted it in his back yard in England. And then he dug it up and said, "Oh, look, I've found the oldest man in history!" And all the scientists came and said, "Oh, yes, this is the oldest man in history." And for twenty or thirty years many men got their Ph.D.s by writing about how this plaster was the oldest man in history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, such fools are leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is the business of dogs, digging up bones. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, by calculating the movements of the moon, scientists can predict years in advance when the solar eclipse will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not their invention. That is already there. (pause) (walking) We shall go further? No? (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One thing is, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if they've wrongly calculated the distance of the moon, then how is it that they're able to calculate these eclipses and whatever?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know. First of all, answer this. Yes. Yes. They say the moon planet first. I say, no, sun planet. First of all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span>(?) But they can see the moon comes in front of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> This is some other planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> That must be some other planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> This one that comes in front of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, all over the world, they accept Sunday first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> All of their successes are accidental. Just like they discovered the planet called Pluto. The way it was discovered was one man recognized that there was a fluctuation in the orbit of the planet Neptune, and so he made some calculations and figured that the fluctuations were caused by another planet that must be further away than Neptune that no one has discovered yet. So he made many calculations and figured out where the planet should be, how big it should be, how much it should weigh, how far away it was. So then he told other scientists about it, and they looked in their telescopes, and sure enough, there it was. But it wasn't as big as he said, nor was it as heavy as he said, nor was it as far away as he said, and when they rechecked the data they found that the orbit of the original planet wasn't really wrong either. So all of his calculations were wrong, but still the planet was there. So somehow or other he stumbled upon it, but all of his calculations to find it were absolutely wrong. That's the planet called Pluto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recently there was an propaganda. That comet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it would come and destroy,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was no comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They said it would destroy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Destroy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They predicted a comet that never came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the Fifth Canto you wrote that the planets are being pulled in their orbits by chariots. Just like there is a description of the sun planet, and there is very elaborate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is movement. Now, according to their calculation, sun is fixed up, but according to our calculation it is moving. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And it is actually being pulled by a chariot and horses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, it is moving. Either chariot or on leg. That does not.... It is moving. Moving is the point. Either on chariot or on leg, that doesn't matter. Sun is moving. But they say sun is fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say it's moving, but not the way we say, around the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they do not say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say it has it's own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Sun is fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is moving by manipulation of air, just like our airplane is moving by manipulating the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, solve this question, that how...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> You had us on that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> You got us on that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said you have caught us. We cannot give a reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, big, big belly. And what is that, Bhārgava, no, what is his name? Bhagavat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Bhagavat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got big belly. (laughter) And Brahmānanda. Gargamuni also. Acyutānanda, yes. In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> These <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> and their sputniks, they're claiming they're going to heavenly planets, all these planets all over the universe, but you tell us that they can't actually go to these places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if you have got suitable machine you can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūdhara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūdhara:</span> They now say that they're going to attempt to create a planet that has perfect air, and trees, and they're only charging...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another bogus. Another bluff. So be satisfied with their bluffs. That's all. (break, conversation continues in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The sun planet is seated on a chariot, and it is pulled by horses? They take it to be mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They cannot imagine how horses can be flying in the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And pulling an entire planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you cannot imagine it, there is no such thing? What is the value of your imagination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you just said by your imagination you can grow a beak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If some horses can fly in the sky, what your imagination will check it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they say that the planet is so heavy and so big it is not possible for a mortal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. The planet is.... How it is floating in the air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have an explanation for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You do not know the explanation. There are so many other things. Just like we say there is ocean of milk, ocean of liquor, ocean of oil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, all of that they take to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span>...imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why? Your imagination. You have not gone throughout the whole universe. You cannot say. You are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they say neither you have gone, so how can you know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have got authority, you have got no authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, simply some story books, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Whatever it may be, I can present some literature, but you have nothing. You rascal. (laughs) Whatever it may be, I have got something, but you have nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember studying in college about this, that we were studying Indian art, and they showed pictures of people on other planets and all these things, the demigods, and the teacher said "These are mythologies of India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like the Greek mythologies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, we have got books, and these books are authorized, they are accepted by authorities, but what you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have their fairy tales, they call it, imaginary tales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, we have got something. I may believe it. That's all. You believe your imagination, we believe this. That's all. Finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ours are better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your imagination is also rascaldom, and if ours, it is rascaldom, that's all right, you are rascal, I am rascal. Why do you pose yourself you are learned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't pose yourself that you are learned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that for thousands and thousands of years man has believed in God, and as a result...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am speaking daily, you must believe in God, the creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that before the scientific revolution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no scientific. It is all rascal revolution. If you cannot answer these questions that you are created by your father, so why there should be no original creator? You cannot say that you have dropped from the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, originally, everything came, man came from the monkey, monkey came from another animal, and everything came from an atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Come to practical, that you are created by your father. That you have to accept. So similarly, everything we see.... This car is created by someone. Everything we see, created. So how can you say there is no creator? Within our experience we see everything is created by someone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Creative energy is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, the fact is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not impersonal, personal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But then who created the creator?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? That we shall see, but first of all you have to accept there is a creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They will agree, some people will agree...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...that there is energy for creating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they do not give one person the credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Just like this manufacturer of this car, he's not handling this creation by his own hand. He has got money, energy. He pays the mechanical person to create, but ultimately it is Ford. Ford is not creating everything. Ford's money, Ford's employees, workers, they are creating, but the name is Ford. Similarly, everything is being created by God. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> And He has got so many working hands. That is also.... <span class="Italic">Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span> Multi-energies, they are doing like that.... But He is supervising, "Have you done this?" "Yes." "That's all. Go on." So how can you go beyond your experience? Everything is created. A child may think, "How this car is created?" But it is, factually it is created. He cannot imagine how this nice car is created. Why child? Even elderly persons in a nondeveloped country, they'll be surprised how this car is created. They cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. That means they're ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. So you cannot imagine that the sky is created, this water is created, that is beyond your experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because you cannot do it, you think no one can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do it. But why another cannot do it? As I see, I cannot manufacture the car, but somebody else can do it. Similarly, the whole big thing, cosmic manifestation, I cannot do it, but somebody may do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are small-minded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's like you were saying for this philosopher, Sartre. We see our practical experience is that someone has less intelligence, someone has more intelligence. So we should understand that God means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The ultimate intelligence. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So now these governments are very rascal. They are cheating the people deliberately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, government means combination of cheaters like you. What do you expect more than that? If you are cheaters, then you go to the government. Someway or other get vote. Bribe or something nefarious you do and get vote, and they become cheap government man. And then do your business. Because you are cheater, you have come to the post of prestige and power. What you will do? You know simply only cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he'll cheat more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. You have now got the power. You cheat more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The people in America that claim that the American government is controlled by Communists. They say that these big, big bankers, the very rich, rich people, that they are actually..., their theory is Communist government, or, not Communist, dictatorship, and that they are secretly manipulating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is their aim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Power..., anyone who has got money, he has got power. That is open secret. What is the secret? (laughs) If you have got money, you have got all power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're very expert in making the people think that this is democracy and that the people have power. (static)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can purchase vote by paying money, then where is democracy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like one of their arguments is that these rich bankers, they can control how much money is being printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, suppose I stand for presidency, and I take money from bank and bribe and get vote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they can actually create, by their control, a depression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, money can buy. The real thing is money. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Money is the criterion in the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga.</span> If you have got money, then you don't require anything; you can purchase anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Purchase justice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, anything. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> So therefore people are trying to get money somehow or other. Then he knows, "I get all power." The present struggle is everyone is trying to get more, more, more, more money. Because everyone knows if I get money then I.... (static) Just like the Beatles and others. Actually what they have got qualification? They have got money. (static) That's all. What qualification? Singer. Singer, according to Vedic culture, third-class, fourth-class man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Most of these famous guys, they are all really the lowest grade people as well. Very low grade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, this John Lennon, how he dares to photograph naked with his lover? How lowest class man he is, that he has no shame even. And he's also big man. Press reporters go to take his opinion on certain subject matters. They do not know where I am going to take opinion. What is the value of this man? But people are after money. Why? "I have got money." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They hold great sway with the general public as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One of the reasons why they did not want John Lennon to be allowed to stay in the United States is because they said that he had too much influence with the young people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he spoiled these. They are already spoiled, and (static) that the government has done nice thing. What is his value? But because he has got money (static) popularity, he has become big man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So there is this theory that there is a conspiracy all over the world that the rich men to control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, we say. If you have got money, you can make conspiracy or anything, whatever you like. Conspiracy I cannot make, I have no money, I cannot make conspiracy. But if I have got money, I can develop a conspiracy with my money. That one man asked, "Have you got any intelligence?" The man began to.... "Let me see." "What is that?" "I am seeing my pocket." "Why pocket?" "Intelligence means pocket." If there is money in my pocket, then there is intelligence. Otherwise, there is no intelligence. And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita also said, <span class="Italic">daridra-doṣo guṇa-rāśir nāśī.</span> A man may be very, very big, qualified man, but if he's poor, everything's finished. <span class="Italic">Daridra-doṣo guṇa-rāśir nāśī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So when they come to our temples and they see that the temple is very opulent, then they think we are intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they are more and more now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The church does this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> More and more our society is getting respect because of the big buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why, I think your Guru Mahārāja was in favor like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, he said that <span class="Italic">potthor katha ke usa cane gauri ber katha sundari</span>(?) If you remain poor, then nobody will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And this diorama project will also give us a lot of respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. We have got many things, stock. We shall exhibit gradually. We have got many things in stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many new ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, I started the book. That is, by Kṛṣṇa's grace, it is becoming successful. Then diorama. Then I shall give next idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This diorama is a major idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I brought the <span class="Italic">Time</span> magazine people to see it. They were so impressed they wanted to come when the museum is open, to make a story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They never saw anything like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deal with them very nicely. We get publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's very costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. Cost, Kṛṣṇa will send money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This project here will cost, how much? About seventy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The actual project, without considering how much the devotees live on, forty thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's the budget for the project, not counting the devotee maintenance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> More than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. You can you can raise that four times price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we don't mind the cost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the BBT is paying part of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And at least, by tickets, people will pay ten dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, that's Bharadvāja's idea, to tickets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Otherwise, how we will raise the money? Book Fund cannot give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Book Fund has been giving one half...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be given as loan, not for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As loan, the whole thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Originally you told me wherever they go, the temple will pay fifty percent and the BBT will pay fifty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's got to be a loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> BBT is, our policy is fifty percent for reprinting and fifty percent for temple. Nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Strict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But that fifty percent for temple is only as loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Except in India (laughs), then it is gift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because we are rich Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is contribution to your Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (laughs) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is our <span class="Italic">guru-dakṣiṇā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There is just one problem, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If the temple thinks that they are going to have to pay for the entire project, it is so costly that they don't want to pay so much. They cannot afford. That's why you originally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they cannot pay, we are not going to hang them. But the condition is this: They must pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe for those who will not pay, we could do simple ones, just with the, a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not say that "If you cannot pay, I will hang you." No. "Pay, try to pay." (static) In our Hyderabad scheme, we have taken three, four <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> loan from you. And he has taken, Jayapatākā has taken, you know? Nobody has paid me. Till now. But there is promise they will pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's good. At least the big temples, Rāmeśvara, in the beginning can certainly afford it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On a long-term basis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I won't even, for New York, I won't even take a loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can forward loan if it is absolutely necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I won't need it. We have the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, this side also road is becoming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All the way down from the beach to downtown Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fixing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is going to be one of the main streets in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's great.</div>
