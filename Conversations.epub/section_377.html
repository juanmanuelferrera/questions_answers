<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that business in your country. What is that? Topless, bottomless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No? They want. There is regular business. In India also. In the hotels there are regular business to pick up college girls and enjoyed by the guests. So many things are going on on this basis of sinful activity. All over the world. So they become polluted, all people..., population, then how they can expect good government? Some of them will take the charge of the government, and he's polluted. (pause) Indigestion. You know that? Indigestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Ha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not digested your food. [break] Any carpenter working in... [break] The government was pleased to reply that they're maintaining themselves by selling literature. Similarly, if it comes to the notice of the government that they're maintaining ourselves by production of food, they'll like very much. [break] In your temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Feeding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...the society would go to the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span>, and there it would be decided what their work would be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all there should be an instructor on the spiritual life, then according to his position... Our spiritual life is meant, we should always remember... But for management we have to make divisions. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Actually the whole society could be Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. They're Vaiṣṇava. But because they have got to live in the material world, there must be division of work. If everyone wants to become the brain, who will act as leg? That is also required. If everyone says, "No, no, I'm not going to do the work of leg. I want simply to work as..." No. It is needed. The brain is needed, the hand is needed, the belly is needed, the leg is needed. So that we have to divide. Who will work as brain, who will work as hand, who will work as leg... The main aim is how to maintain this body perfectly, fit. That should be the aim, how the society will go on nicely. And for management, this hand, leg, brain, belly must be divided. Just like there's slight difference, those who are directly engaged in temple worship and those who are going to sell books. Apparently there's difference, but basically there is no difference. Like that. If one can sell books nicely, why he should be, I mean to say, engaged in the temple worship? He can do better work in that way. But there is no difference between selling the books and temple worship. Or washing the dish. There's no difference, because it is all transcendental. Just like <span class="Italic">aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti. </span>Kṛṣṇa's hands and legs, there's no difference. You've read this verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still leg and hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyam</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He says, "Those who repeat this message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> are most dear friends to me, and there's no one more dear to Me than he..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Wouldn't that indicate that a preacher is higher than a worker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is preaching, this is preaching. You help. Suppose you are preaching, and if I help you... Just like I'm preaching, you're helping. You are also preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Also this building is preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also preaching. So it is not that preaching means simply talking. Preaching means everything. The construction is also preaching. The designing is also preaching. Everything is... Otherwise what is the use of spending so much money if it is not preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah. [break] Everything that has to do with propagating Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...in any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is preaching. Just like... <span class="Italic">Nava-vidhā-bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam<br class="calibre2"/>arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sakhyam ātma-nivedanam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.5.23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">They're all perfect, but it appears <span class="Italic">śravaṇa,</span> hearing, is different from <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Or <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is different from <span class="Italic">smaraṇam</span> or <span class="Italic">pāda-sevanam</span> or <span class="Italic">arcanam.</span> But they're all perfect. So one should be engaged either in <span class="Italic">śravaṇam, kīrtanam, smaraṇam</span>-as he's fit. This is the... Suppose I cannot speak, <span class="Italic">kīrtanam,</span> but I can hear. That is as perfect. Ah? <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ. </span>So one may argue that "Speaking is better than hearing." No. Both ways, either hearing or speaking, they're the same thing. Because it is for Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ. </span>In our society every work is transcendental: for preaching. Every work. But one must be engaged with some work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's important...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is important. Otherwise every work is preaching. See that everyone is engaged. There was an advertisement by the railroad department, their monogram was a wheel of carriage and they have written that every employee of the railroad should see that the wheel is running on. Wheel is running on. Now suppose in the office the clerks are working, so how they will see the wheel is running on? Because in the office of railway there is some complaint, there is some claim, there so many things... But that is depending on their wheel. So they should expedite their business so that wheel may not stop, it must go on. It is very nice instruction. So the wheel is going on. Suppose some station has asked for ten wagons immediately, and that requires the sanction of the divisional superintendent. That is his office. So the clerk should help the progress that immediately the sanction is done. Then the wheel will go on. Do you understand? So everyone can help that the railway wheel is going on. Although apparently it will appear that "What this clerk has to do with the wheel going on?" Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So there's so much to do in Kṛṣṇa's service, everyone can be engaged in some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that everyone should know... Suppose one is engaged in cooking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> You should see that nice <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is served to the worker, quickly, so they can take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> be healthy and go on preaching. So he is helping preaching by cooking. Just like you are working and the brain is also working, "Go this side, go that side, the car is coming." Brain says, the... "Leg, come this side." Everyone is working. The leg is working, the brain is working, the hand is working, the tongue is working. But the business of the tongue and business of the leg is different. The aim being, the central point being Kṛṣṇa, to help, to serve Him, then everything is work, absolute. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they cannot understand it. They think that "Kṛṣṇa is working like ordinary man. How He can become God? It is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa is also <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" Therefore we called them Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> A leader must be very expert so that people would be happy in their engagement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone should be expert. The leaders must be expert and the worker must be expert so that they may follow the instruction of the leader. If the leader says something and the workers, "Hm, I shall consider it, later on," then how the leader will execute his leadership? Both of them should be cooperating and know that "We are all working for Kṛṣṇa." Somebody was coming back and going... Coming this side or... Our men? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> There are so many... So few compared to other religions, but we make so big propaganda always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is admitted, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement it is admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because we are not lazy like Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> "I have become now Brahman-stop work. Eat and make your belly..." You see how Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsī...</span> Ah. (Prabhupāda gestures; devotees laugh) They think that "Now I have become Brahman, I have nothing to do. (Prabhupāda laughs) I have become Nārāyaṇa." "If you've got nothing to do, then why you are eating?" And for one <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi </span>you'll find there are many Māyāvādīs. They're busy simply collecting <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis. </span>(devotees laugh) So what is time of your starting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> We're starting at nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> is being served at eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. This Christian land is not available?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There's no reliable information on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can get from that gentleman... (end)</div>
