<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have heard something about our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> I know something in general, yes. Perhaps you would tell me more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is based on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So primarily, it is based on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and then it is being explained from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the preliminary study of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we get ideas from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> how God consciousness can make the human society happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes. (keeps saying "Yes" repeatedly throughout the conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The aim of human society should be God realization. That is the distinction between an animal and a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> recommends that the whole society should be divided into four divisions: the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> or the most intellectual persons, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> the administrators, the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> the mercantile agriculturists, and the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> ordinary men, laborer or worker. Because this material world is conducted by three modes of nature, goodness, passion and ignorance, so according to the quality of the person, he should be listed in different categories. And it is the duty of the state to see that all these categories, divisions, they are working nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, by God's arrangement, by nature's arrangement, all the necessities of the living entities, they will be supplied. They will be free from all anxieties, diseases. This was practically demonstrated during the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. I, I wish to quote some passages from... during the reign of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Start with number one?</div>
<div class="Verse">śaunaka uvāca<br class="calibre2"/>hatvā svariktha-spṛdha ātatāyino<br class="calibre2"/>yudhiṣṭhiro dharma-bhṛtāṁ variṣṭhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sahānujaiḥ pratyavaruddha-bhojanaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kathaṁ pravṛttaḥ kim akāraṣīt tataḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.10.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, after the Battle of Kurukṣetra, all the five brothers, they were almost fasting, as, what is called, atonement for so many people killed for their sake. Then, under the instruction of elderly persons, Bhīṣma and Kṛṣṇa, he accepted the ruling power, governmental, and during his time... You read that, <span class="Italic">kāmaṁ vavarṣa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It says,</div>
<div class="Verse">kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāma-dughā mahī<br class="calibre2"/>siṣicuḥ sma vrajān gāvaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>payasodhasvatīr mudā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.10.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Translation. During the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This was the position of the kingdom, that the cows felt secure. At the present moment, the cows are very unhappy. I have seen. They are almost crying. Because they can understand that "After some time, we'll be killed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can understand that. So during Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's time, the cows were happy, and because they were happy, they were producing so much milk that when they were on the pasturing ground, the pasturing ground became moist with milk. Milk was dropping. So much milk supply. And <span class="Italic">kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ: [SB </span>1.10.4] There was regular rainfall and ample production of food grains, other things also. Just like jewelry, they are also produced by the rainfall and certain constellation of the stars. That we understand from the astrological books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they produce these stones also, mean <span class="Italic">puṣyanna-kṣatra.</span> So therefore it is said that <span class="Italic">kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ [SB </span>1.10.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> And this <span class="Italic">parjanyaḥ,</span> or the rainfall, is made possible by performing sacrifices. You read that portion, <span class="Italic">parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> This is from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni</span> means by eating sufficiently, the living entities, they grow, they become strong, both animals and human beings. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the <span class="Italic">anna,</span> these grains, they are produced from <span class="Italic">parjanyaḥ,</span> from clouds. Now? Next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñād bhavati parjanyo...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> And when we regularly perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> then there is regular cloud in the sky. And when there is cloud in the sky, there is regular rainfall, and when there is regular rainfall, there is sufficient production of food grains, fruits and other vegetables so that both the animal and the human beings, they eat sufficiently, they grow strength, they become happy and again perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> And the animals supply, the cow supplies milk. In this way, the whole society becomes happy. These are the prescriptions, or directions, given by the Vedic literature. So if people take advantage of this instruction, as you have mentioned in your article "The Great Seers," so if we follow their instruction, the whole history of the human being can be changed. There is no difficulty. But whether the people will accept or not, that is the business of the leaders of the society. So far I think that British people, they organized very nicely the British Empire, but some way or other, it is now lost. But still, the British prestige can be elevated if actually, according to the Vedic instruction, you try to make your social construction, the political institution and economic development... Every direction is there. So you are all great historians. And there are many politicians. If you take this instruction of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> little seriously, you can make your state an ideal state, and people are still ready to follow you. Then the whole history of the world will change. And if you people agree, then I can help you. I can help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be ample production of food grains and milk product. Then the whole economic problem solved. And the formula is there. How to get ample agricultural production and milk, everything is there in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And the examples of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, that is also there. But one... We must be serious to accept this formula for practical application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes. You would apply the teachings of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> to all human societies at all times. Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Yes, that is my ambition, that let the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> be practically accepted by the human society, and surely they'll be happy. Surely. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glanīr bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So now everything is confused. And in your country, or western countries, they are very organized. So you are not feeling now so much confusion. But it is coming. But in India and countries like that, it is very confusion state. Yes. They have lost their own culture, and they could not assimilate the western type of civilization. So they are lost. They are lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> In India is everybody lost, the Indian culture...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not everybody. But general mass of people, at least, the so-called educated, five to ten percent people, they are lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And so-called educated, they practically guide. You'll be surprised to know that in 1950, one of my students, he was a government statistics officer. So he went to some village, and he gave me report that the villagers inquired from him that <span class="Italic">"Babuji, agar angarej ko vote diya yai pasatela </span>(?)"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You understand Hindi? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No, I don't. No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The inquiry was that "If we again give votes to the Englishmen, will they come and do." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they were feeling the... Actually, in India... In our childhood, we know. Every Indian felt very secure. They never expected that Britishers will go. They were so sympathetic. And now they... This is the pulse felt by that statistics officer. They are not very much satisfied with the present system of government. British administration was very much appreciated by the Indians. Even Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura appreciated. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, he has written in something, somewhere, that "The Britishers also very nice because they don't interfere with the religious affairs." So as soon as they changed their views and tried to divide the Hindus and Muslims, the British Empire lost. According to Queen's declaration, the Britishers pledged that "They will not interfere with your religious affairs." Later on, for political purposes, when they interfered with this Hindu-Muslim question, then the British Empire lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes. But the people who rule India now have a western education mostly. The Indians who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Perverted, converted. Just like Nehru. Nehru was western-educated. He was educated in London. But he hated everything Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That was the res... Formerly, in our childhood we saw that any gentleman coming here in London and goes back to India, he no more mixes with the Indian soil. He... They were called "England-returned." So they made their own society. Then our Ram Mohan Raya, he formed a Brahmo Society. And so many things changed. Again, they are now topsy-turvied. So actually, India's position is that they have lost their own culture, and they could not assimilate the western culture. But in the western countries, if they accept this Vedic process of civilization, then they will again take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "A Rival for Nelson."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "A Rival for Nelson."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was newspaper photograph. You have seen that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Guardian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guardian. "A Rival for Nelson." Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Well, the western countries are mostly concerned with economics, money, wealth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> It's about the same as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they can continue. But the spirit of Vedic culture should be accepted. It is not that because one has to accept the Vedic culture, he has to stop industry or material progress. Not like that. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> does not teach that. Simply to change the consciousness. Therefore we have named the Society "Kṛṣṇa Consciousness." One has to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then everything will be adjusted. Not the mode of life should be changed. Little change. Just like we recommend that four things should be avoided: illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. So to give up these four kinds of activities, which are considered to be sinful, that is not very difficult. That is not very difficult. These English and, I mean to say, European and American boys, they are young men. They have given up. So in the society, if there is prevalence of sinful activities, then there will be reaction. So these four things are considered sinful activities: illicit sex, meat, unecessarily killing of animals, and intoxication, and gambling. <span class="Italic">Yatra pāpas catur-vidhaḥ.</span> These are four kinds of sinful activities. So Vedic civilization means they should be freed from the sinful activities. Then other things will automatically come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think Mr. Toynbee... I saw on television, I saw you once on a television program in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And you concluded that if men came out of this age who had developed a spirit of renunciation, true renunciation from material pursuit, that this would enable the world to rectify its present precarious position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Do you see any signs of change in the western world or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, change can take place any moment, provided they will take this movement little seriously. Change for good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Change for good. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And your article showed that you are also for change for good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our movement and your honor, we can cooperate for the good of the general people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How do you see this "spirit of true renunciation," as you call it, how do you see it...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How do you see that that is able to come about at this time in history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> There are some signs in western countries, of people turning away from just money-making professions, I think. Small signs, but distinct signs perhaps. But it'll take a long time, and probably only through a great deal of suffering will people learn to change their attitude to life, I think. I think in Britain at the present, people of all classes are going for more wealth, more material standard of living, and so on, they're thinking almost entirely of this, which doesn't make for happiness and cannot really be achieved by everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Many young people, especially young people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Many people nowadays are finding this renunciation quite simple and easy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...as Prabhupāda was saying about the four rules and so many other activities. We may perform something on the surface, but the renunciation is there in our consciousness because we're giving everything to Kṛṣṇa as a service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes. What about America? (Sound of glasses of water being poured)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> That's good. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Some water, Dr. Toynbee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No, thank you. And what about Japan? She's an Asian country, but has been very successful in the western way now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, we have two centers there also. Japan also, we have centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> I get the impression the Japanese are not very happy. They're very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can be happy with this materialistic way of life. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Our centers, Prabhupāda has started centers all over the world, one hundred and ten centers. Thousands of people are giving up the material attachment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bengal, there was one secretary of the government, Toynbee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You knew him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's different man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Probably some connection there. Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I... In some business I saw him sometimes in 1948, like that. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Sad that Bengal has been divided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Very sad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bengal is now divided. East Bengal is now called Bangladesh, and West Bengal is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> They still keep to the language, and they feel themselves Bengalis, though they're just (most?) Muslims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. They're keeping the Bengali language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India was divided, Pakistan and Hindustan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes. There's a great consciousness of difference of language too in India, which is rather new. In the past...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The two Bengals, they speak the same language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Two... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But West Pakistan, they speak Hindi, or Urdu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> And the southern states are very conscious of their different languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, English language... Now we see. We have got the facility of speaking in English language all over the world. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> That is true. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole America speaks English language. Australia, New Zealand. In India also, practically all educated men, they speak in English. So in Africa. In Europe also, they understand English language. Not very much, but... (laughs) The Germans, especially, they do not like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Only at the airport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> France? What is the position in France? They don't like also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Canada, there is two languages, English and French.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes. And unfortunately, a great feeling between the two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This material world is based on jealousy. And spiritual world is based on friendship. That is the difference. So the, these materialistic persons, United Nations, League of Nations, they are trying to unite, but they, at heart, there is jealousy. So they can never become united. This is only bogus farce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot be united because at heart there is jealousy. They go to the United Nations assembly. So one man is speaking with jealousy for the other. The other man is speaking (laughs) with jealous... So how they can be united? It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes. Yes. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, they should adopt this Kṛṣṇa conscious platform. <span class="Italic">Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstava vastu vedyaṁ atra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it is a very scientific movement. I would like that persons like you, you should take some little active part to push on this movement. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What do we mean by renunciation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Renunciation, practically, there is no question of renunciation. According to our philosophy... Just like father and the son. So son cannot renounce father's protection or the property. Some way or other, he has to take advantage of it. But... Therefore renunciation means that as every son has got a right on the property of the father, similarly, every living entity has got right to live at the cost of God. But they should not encroach upon others' right. That is renunciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But at the present moment, they are encroaching upon others' right. And that is sinful, and he's punishable. Just like every living entity has got the right to live at the cost of God. But the human being is interfering with the rights of living of the animals. They have got the right. As human being has got the right to live...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes. I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...why not they? National. National means a living entity born in particular country. So at the present moment, the national means only human being. The animals are not nationals. They are being sent to the slaughterhouse. So this kind of sinful activities are going on. Therefore renunciation means to give up these sinful activities. That is real renunciation. Otherwise, you cannot renounce anything. You have to live. And that is allowed at the cost of God. Everything belongs to God. You are son of God. So you live. But don't encroach... <span class="Italic">Mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam.</span> That is the instruction of <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Everything belongs to God. <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā.</span> So you have got the right to enjoy what is allotted for you. Don't encroach upon others' right. This is renunciation. But they are encroaching upon others' right. Especially the human society. And that is the cause of all troubles. Because they have no God consciousness, they have no sense about God, and there is no sense about next life... What is your opinion about life after death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> My opinion is that an individual human being is, in life in this world, is temporarily separated from the whole of spiritual reality, and after death we rejoin the reality that we are separated from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Christian idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. After death... But so far I know, Christian there is consideration of hell and heaven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody is going to hell, somebody's going to heaven. Is it not? After death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That was my understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That is the Christian idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if there is question of hell and heaven, then we are responsible in this life for our next life, whether we are going to hell or heaven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes. I would agree. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is nice. There is next life. And according to your work, you get hellish life or heavenly life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> And you would believe that <span class="Italic">karma</span> is continuous from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> ...one life to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, transferred. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is practical. If you become nice student...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma</span> can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...then, in future, you become a nice professor. But if you do not study nicely, how you can become a professor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">karma</span> you cannot deny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, in this life, my <span class="Italic">karma...</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa.</span> According to your <span class="Italic">karma</span> and by the supervision of superior authority, you get a body. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur deha upapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The living entity gets a certain type of body according to the <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And this is allotted by superior authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people do not know all these things. They have no idea. They have no idea, neither... Even these things are there in the Vedic literature, they are not very much interested. And practically, in the darkness, they do not know what is next... I talked with Professor Kotofsky in Moscow. He, he is in charge of Indology. That gentleman told me, "Swamiji, after death there is nothing. Everything is finished." So I was surprised, that such a learned man, and he has no idea of the transmigration of the soul. These are the defects of modern civilization. Those who are leaders, teachers, they are not sufficiently in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> I think, in western countries now, people are very much afraid of death. It's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Especially in America, people are very much afraid of... They won't even mention or think about death which is a great weakness. One should be able to think about death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The thing is... That is natural. That is natural. Suppose if, after my death, I am going to become something lower than my present position, certainly I must be afraid of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if somebody gives me... This is a fact. Recently one astrologer has said that one of the biggest politicians in India, he has now become a dog in Sweden. May be correct or not, but there is possibility. There is possibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because from the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> we understand, <span class="Italic">karmāṇa,</span> by work, one has to... <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> By <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> by nature, as we make... Just like if we eat little more, so by the laws of nature, immediately there is indigestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot deny this adjustment. So why not...? I am sufferer of my <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So according to my <span class="Italic">karma,</span> I get a body,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...suffering or enjoyment. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ [Bg. 9.25], bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā...</span> Who goes where-that is stated here. <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ [Bg. </span>14.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. We can understand. We can understand where we are going. So one who is going to a higher level of life-and the most perfection of life is go back to home, back go Godhead-he's not afraid of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sādhu maro vā jīva vā.</span> It is said, for a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> saintly person, either he lives or dies, he has the same position, back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma</span> can be changed for better or for worse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma</span> can be changed by <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise, cannot be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes. In each life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By <span class="Italic">bhakti. Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājam [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> The <span class="Italic">karma</span> can be counteracted only by <span class="Italic">bhakti-bhājam,</span> devotional service. Otherwise it is not. Therefore our duty is only to endeavor for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not to bother with other things, economic development. Because they are under the <span class="Italic">karma</span> laws. So whatever happiness and distress under <span class="Italic">karma</span> I am destined to suffer or enjoy, that will come automatically. So you haven't got to try for it. But if you, if we do not try for development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we are wasting time. So far our other things are concerned, that will come and go according to <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes. But not many people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Not many people in western countries are thinking about this now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it proves less intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they do not know the law of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and the transmigration of the soul, change of body, that means no intellectual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, yes, yes. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Now, in India more people are living in the western way, though, living in cities, working in factories and offices. Does this make them have the western state of mind, the western point of view? Or can they resist it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everything can be changed. If they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The consciousness has to be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes, that... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, let him work in the factory or in the office, in the city. It doesn't matter. One has to change his consciousness. Then he's perfect, Kṛṣṇa conscious, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That consciousness has to be changed.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> The Greeks, like Indo-China, have a great past, and this is quite a difficulty for them. They're rather overshadowed by their own past. They don't quite know how to deal with it. I am writing about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your view about connection of the old Greeks with India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> About the Greeks in India?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were with me in Indonesia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is your view of the future, the history, the future history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is there, described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The, the governmental power will go to the rascals and thieves, rogues. And their only business will be how to exploit the people. So one side, by not sufficient rain, there will be scarcity of foodstuff, and one side, the government will tax like anything. In this way, people will be so much harassed that they will give up their hearth and home and go to the forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This will be done in Kali-yuga. And gradually, there will be no supply of grains. Especially rice, wheat, sugar, milk, these things will be finished. So people will be obliged to take flesh. These are all stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In that case, is there any hope in a movement like ours to rectify the situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If they take to Kṛṣṇa co... That is also stated, <span class="Italic">kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">. Kīrtanād,</span> by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can become free from all these calamities and go back to home, back to Godhead. Only Kṛṣṇa conscious people will be free from all these calamities. Others will have to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So societies in general will not improve, but more people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Improve... Major portion is stated like that. But there is always light and darkness. Always. So the light party will be also there. This is the only, that take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ.</span> In the Kali-yuga, it is an ocean of faults. <span class="Italic">Doṣa-nidhi. Nidhi</span> means ocean, and <span class="Italic">doṣa</span> means faults. But there is one opportunity. <span class="Italic">Kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ.</span> Very great profit. What is that? <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.</span> Simply by chanting Kṛṣṇa's name and becoming Kṛṣṇa con..., one shall be freed from all these calamities and he'll go back to home, back to Godhead. Simply by this. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.</span> This very word is used. <span class="Italic">Mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.</span> So this is the only shelter. If people take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they'll be saved from all the calamities of this age. Otherwise, there is no other... Now they are going to the forest, the hippies. Eh? <span class="Italic">Ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā gacchanti giri-kānanam. Giri-kānanam</span> means to the forests, to the hills. They'll go. <span class="Italic">Ācchinna-dāra-draviṇām. Dāra</span> means wife, and <span class="Italic">draviṇā</span> means money. So they'll be separated from wife and money, and they'll go to the forest and hills, being disappointed. This is happening already. <span class="Italic">Ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā gacchanti giri-kānanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Does this correspond, Mr. Toynbee, with your view of the future history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the future history. You can predict in your writings. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Arnold Toynbee:</span> With more people in politics in India, are they able to keep the Vedic ideal? Or...?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The politicians, they (say that) "These books are useless. Throw them in the water." They say like that publicly. They are not interested. Rather, this movement, as I have now began with my disciples, European, American boys, they're... They are not very satisfied, the present politicians. They are not very satisfied. They don't want. Everywhere this, more or less the same mentality, but it is our duty on behalf of Kṛṣṇa to push on this movement. So we are doing, and we are getting response. It is not without response. It will increase. That is also stated, that for ten thousand years Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will increase. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ten thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within ten thousand years, if they become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then life is successful.
