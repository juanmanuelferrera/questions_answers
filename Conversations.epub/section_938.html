<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our authority, I have got my authority, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Vedic literatures. Why shall I give you better preference, your authority? I have got my authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So we'll explain there are two types of acquiring knowledge. Two different techniques. Now the scientists are believing their own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is imperfect. Inductive knowledge is always imperfect. Deductive knowledge is perfect if it is taken from the authority. Suppose man is mortal. So inductive process is that you examine every man whether he's mortal or immortal. So suppose you have seen millions of men, and they are all mortal, they die. Then your conclusion is man is mortal. But I can say you have not seen a man who does not die. I can say that. So this inductive knowledge will remain always imperfect. It will never be perfect, because your examination is limited. So I can that say you have not seen the person, man... Suppose if I say you have not seen Vyāsadeva, he's immortal. You have not seen Aśvatthāmā, he's immortal. So how this scientific research can be perfect, inductive? It is never perfect. Because you may be missing somebody who is immortal. Then your conclusion is wrong. There is no scope of studying all the living beings. There is no such scope. You have limited scope. So your seeing power is limited. How you can decide from the limited seeing power?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They will say, "Well, we have done so many good things, we have produced so many nice things."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have done nothing good, I say. You have simply wasted time and taken public money, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> "We have made some mistakes, but we have produced some good things in medicine and, anyway, you should accept our authority because we have done so many good things."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because you have done something, that I accept. Just like you have done very good, 747 airplane, but just make a mosquito, with pilot and everything. Can you do it? Then why do you take all the credit. Take credit for 747, that's all. But when I ask you create another plane like a fly or mosquito, you are unable to do it. Then why do you take, "There is no God; science is everything." Why do you say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's why we want to bring up this point that "Scientists, we are not claiming that you are all nonsense, but you are all good men, but you should know your limits."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should not be so proud falsely. That is our point. And mislead others that there is no God. Because you are accepted as authority, scientist, if you say that there is no God, they will accept it. Then our back to Godhead movement is stopped. Then we must stop your also nonsense. It is a fight. Because you say there is no God, and we say you are all nonsense. We must say it. You are challenging, we must challenge. But you accept God, then we have nothing... I think Sir Isaac Newton said like that: "The vast knowledge, we have simply gathered a few grains of sand on the beach of knowledge," something like that. That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, humble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good. But how you can say there is no God, everything is science? And misleading people. That must be stopped. You take credit as much as you have done. That we are ready to give you. Because you have created one airplane, 747, therefore you can do everything, if you give... Like that, that is misleading. That we cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, once that very concept that they will be able to do all these things, if that is removed, then they come on the platform as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of sane man. They are talking like insane man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ravīndra-svarūpa(?):</span> But that inspiration is that we can always do something bigger and better than we've done before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still you cannot do in the final. That is not possible. Because you are finite. You are not infinite. Your knowledge is limited. You can do something up to some extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ravīndra-svarūpa:</span> They agree, they all agree,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are giving bluff: "Yes we shall produce life. Wait for millions of years, wait for millions." This is nonsense. Who will wait for millions of years and see your scientific discovery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They say "Yes, we are finite, but we can work together, combinedly together, and make great progress, scientific progress. All working together, every nation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do anything which is beyond your power. But you are limited, your power is limited, that you must agree. Your power is not unlimited. You are finite. That you must admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ravīndra-svarūpa:</span> Then they say "Yes, we may be limited and our inductive process may be imperfect, but, you may criticize, but you have to show us something better."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may not show, but as I give you example, that you have manufactured 747 and God has manufactured mosquito. You do that. We are... I am layman, but I see there is another, better manufacturer than you. I may be layman, but I can see that you cannot do it. If you say you can do it, then you are rascal. I must say that you are rascal. First of all do, then speak. You take your credit, as much as you have done. But if you want to take the place of God, then we must slap you right and left. (laughter) We cannot give better credit than God to anyone. That is our business. <span class="Italic">Asamordhva.</span> There is nobody equal to God, nobody is greater than God. This is our preaching. So you cannot claim equal to God. No question of becoming greater than God. You cannot become even equal to God. You are always under. You admit it, then we have no quarrel with you. You admit that "Yes, we are under God," then we are friends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And as soon as you say that you are equal or greater, then you are rascal. We must expose you, that you are a rascal. This is our business. Because we are servants of God. We cannot see anything blasphemy against God. That is not our business. We must chastise immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In that way we can help the people in general.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actually, that is the fact. If you are actually scientist, then prove that there is God. That is your success of education. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito...</span> [SB 1.5.22]. Your education has meaning when by your education, by your scientific knowledge, you'll prove that there is God, He is so glorified. Then you are welcome. Then you are really scientist. And if you become a rascal, then you say "Oh, there is no need of God. We are going to manufacture. Just wait for one million years." Is that good proposal, I have to wait for one million years to see your scientific research work? And we shall allow such fools to flourish? That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It will be a very great service to the people in general if we can stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Warn that "Here are thieves, be careful of your pocket. They'll say all bluff and take money from your pocket."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We will call a spade a spade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What do you think, is that right process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make a magazine to expose this. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">,</span> you, by your knowledge, you describe the glories of the Lord, then you are my guru. This is our... If they say "Why do you bother about God?" that is the business of human being. A human being, he is given the chance to understand God, and you people are stopping, putting stumbling block in his understanding of God. You're the greatest miscreant. I have got a chance to get one million dollars, and if you check it, I cannot get it, how much mischievous you are for me. Is it not? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes, they are stopping it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have got chance to get from a friend one million dollars, and he's ready, and if somebody checks it, that I may not get that one million dollars, then he's the greatest enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They are stopping the benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So the human life is meant for understanding God, and these rascals by all dead theories, they are stopping to understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Scientists are responsible for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the greatest mischief-maker, in the name of scientific knowledge. We must fight against them. Let them agree, "Yes, God is supreme." Then there is no fight. But as soon as they say that there is no need of God, science will solve everything, then they are rascal, you must expose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Another point about this Institute, from my experience in the last few days in Washington, there were some Indians who come to the temple, and they are very favorable to the concept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Include such members. Let them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yesterday this Sharma, Dr. Sharma, he came, and he's going to come this evening, he's quite well known as a scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Medical man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, he's not medical man, but he has two or three Ph.D.'s in two, three different fields. In engineering, in chemistry and in pathology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> He's becoming a life member, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That pathologist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. He works in National Institute of Health in Washington, D.C. We was telling me he was from Haridwar from a very pious family, and he said his parents are Vaiṣṇavas, and he has been thinking since from his childhood about this problem about life, the origin of life and consciousness, and we talked a little bit about our concept of this origin of life, connecting from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the scientific interrelationship. And he was very much impressed, and he told me that if he can be of any help, he's willing to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should call him, let us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, he's coming this evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> In India, there are many Ph.D.'s and scientists who are Vaiṣṇavas, and they write articles. But in India it doesn't go noticed. In the South, there are many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In South, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> In Bangalore and many places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all Vaiṣṇavas. So recruit them. You know? Then let them write articles in this. Yes, it will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, we can print on the magazine, "Please write articles," many big men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, in fact he wanted to put an articles, this very man Sharma, he wanted to write an articles on consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them write, we shall publish. And similarly, ask the South Indian Ph.D.'s, we want so many Ph.D.'s writing. Then it will be respectable. People will understand that this is not ordinary thing. All learned scholars they are writing, that will carry some respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So these persons, I was mentioning to you in the car, that we would like to have them associated in some way with the Institute, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if they write articles, if they read our books, that is associated. Not that they will have to come here and sit down with us. Let them read the book and deliberate and write nice article, their opinion. That will be nice. Then you'll get sufficient article for publishing. That is wanted. All the Ph.D. Vaiṣṇavas, they may take advantage of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, and it will be respected in the big circles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. If they are getting respect talking all nonsense, and here we shall glorify the Supreme Lord, why not respect?</div>
<div class="Verse">ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā<br class="calibre2"/>varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB 1.2.13]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">When they try to satisfy the senses of Kṛṣṇa, His glory, then the Ph.D. is perfect. And if continues to talk nonsense, then it is useless waste of time and labor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Another point about this journal is that we will present controversial things, and people may want to write something to refute what we have said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You refute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We can publish that and also our refutation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is nice. We invite, "All right, come on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "Criticize, and we will defeat you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That will be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, it will be more interesting. The more fight, the more people like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, we shall have to go now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I think it's best if we would drive back now to Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Let us go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Try your best, Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence. I started this fight alone, now Kṛṣṇa is... (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 7, 1976, Baltimore</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> ...how you explained that our movement is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Just so they don't think it is only ten years old. (devotees bring in a cake or Prabhupāda distributes, eating, etc.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is very heavy cake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Very nice. <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the movement of <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> pleasure only. Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">ānandamaya,</span> and if you remain with Kṛṣṇa you'll become <span class="Italic">ānandamaya.</span> A rich man, he's enjoying, and if you remain in association with the rich man, you also enjoy. Where is the difficulty? A very rich man, and his associates, they are also rich men. Is it not? And if you remain with poor man, you are also poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You've explained that the servant in the house of the king, he is almost as good as the king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is better than king. King, he eats whatever is offered to him, but they can eat whatever they like. Is it not? Who is restricting them? (aside:) You can open that. Just stand towards there. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that, cutting the cake, is that a Vedic..., did they used to do that in Vedic times, or is that a Western invention? We were just wondering about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> distribution. Either you cut or take with hand, the same thing. It doesn't make any difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> On the cake it was marked on one side 1966, on the other side 1976. Like a coin. They make coins celebrating, commemorating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the cake is made very nicely. Who has made it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> This one girl, her name is Lalitā-sakhī. She stayed up all night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> And then it was decorated by Ambujākṣa, who is an artist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woman should be expert in cooking. That is their natural tendency. They should be educated how to cook nicely, how to please the husband, how to take care of the children. This is Vedic civilization. In the beginning a woman, childhood, she's trained up by the mother. Then as soon as she is married, formerly, child-marriage, so she's transferred to the care of mother-in-law. There she is trained up. Then she becomes very good housewife, takes care of household affairs, husband, children, and home becomes happy. What is this nonsense, divorce? There is no such thing in the Vedic civilization, divorce. You must accept whatever God has given you as husband or wife, you must. They had no thinking even, idea of divorce. One may not agree with the husband. That is natural. Sometimes we do not agree. But there is no question of divorce. When this divorce system was introduced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Comparatively recent. Because for many years the Catholic Church forbade it. When did it begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Henry the Eighth, the King of England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he's the rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He had many wives, he wanted to divorce his wife and he could not under Catholic Church, so he started his own church, Church of England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because many wives were not allowed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, they had a system, one wife, but he got fed up with them. He chopped off the heads of two of them and then... It was considered a bit outrageous. So then he wanted to divorce and have another wife after the third or fourth one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he used to cut them, the head?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, two of them he did. And then the Catholic Church excommunicated him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in Vedic civilization they keep, they have more than one wife. So what is the use of killing? Why one should kill? We find from the history, Dhruva Mahārāja's mother and stepmother, there were some critical words, and Dhruva Mahārāja became very, very angry. So the critical words and wives, different wives, that may be, but why one should cut off the head? Dhruva Mahārāja's mother said when Dhruva Mahārāja began to cry before the mother, mother said "My dear child, what can I do? How can I help you? Your father does not care for me, even as maidservant, what to speak of I am queen, I am the senior queen. So this gentleman does not care of me even as maidservant. How can I help you? If God helps you, then..." That was her statement. So that does not mean because the king did not like, she should be beheaded. What is this nonsense? If he is,(?)... may be... After all, he is king. He may not like first wife. Actually, there was no scarcity of comfort, but liking may not be, but that does not mean that she shouldn't be accepted as wife. Kings were allowed to marry more than one wife. Why to accept another wife means another wife should be killed? What is this? Everything nonsense. King can marry more than one wife. And at the time of marriage they were given so many woman. Because the woman population is greater than the man, always. So when the King is married, along with the queen, many other friends of the queen they would go with the king. They live in the same palace, same palace. Sometimes they had children, <span class="Italic">dāsī-putra.</span> Just like Vidura. Vidura was not queen's son. One of these women friends. So that was allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They were raised with the real sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Treated nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not that because he is born of a <span class="Italic">dāsī</span> no care should be taken. No, equal. But he cannot inherit the throne, that's all. There was no question. Even Muhammadans, they used to marry more than one wife. Two hundred years ago, one Muslim Nawab of Lucknow, Wazel Dusayet(?), he had hundred and sixty wives. The palaces are still there, Lucknow, hundred and sixty palaces. Why the Nawab? Our Kṛṣṇa, not hundred sixty but another zero, another, hundred sixty thousand, two zeros. Hundred sixty plus two zeros. They were not neglected. But He is God, He expanded Himself also, sixteen thousand forms, so that no wife would feel separation. So if one husband can maintain properly more than one wife, he's allowed. But the wife must be taken care of properly. Not that because I have got more than one wife, one is neglected, one is... No. She must be taken care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> We were talking the other day, not in our society though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Not in the ISKCON society, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the Kali-yuga one cannot maintain even one wife, what to speak of more than one. They are afraid to marry one wife. I first heard this, one elderly lady in New York. At that time, I was newcomer. I asked her, "Why don't you get your son married?" "Yes, he can be married, provided he can maintain wife," she said. So these things were unknown to us. In India, whether he'll be able to maintain... Just like I was married when I was third-year student. Where is the income? There is no income, but still I was married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was formerly the Western system, that the prospective son-in-law would be checked first to see whether he would be able to maintain the girl.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is everywhere. But expectation, he is educated, he'll be able. The first thing is in due time, either the girl or the boy must be married, that is Indian system. In due time. Boy not exceeding twenty years or twenty-five years, at most, and girl not exceeding fifteen years, sixteen years, must be. <span class="Italic">Saṁskāra,</span> this is one of the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra,</span> this is also one <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> and marriage is also <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> Must be married. <span class="Italic">Daśa-vidha-saṁskāra,</span> ten kinds of <span class="Italic">saṁskāras,</span> out of which marriage is one of the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras.</span> And <span class="Italic">kanyā-dāya. Kanyā-dāya, dāya</span> means by law the father is bound to get his daughter married, by law. He cannot escape the responsibility. This is father's duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You gave the example that if sometimes the man becomes bankrupt he goes to court and the judge says, "You must take this money you have left to your creditors and be satisfied," and he can escape in that way. But the one duty that a father has is getting the daughter married; that he cannot escape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore it is called <span class="Italic">dāya, dāya-bhāk,</span> legally he is bound. He may not get his son married, but the daughter must be married. This is father's duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is sinful, actually considered sinful, if he doesn't do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because without father the daughter cannot be properly married. Daughter or son, everyone, if the father, mother, by their supervision, the boys and girls get married, that is very good. They see how they will be happy. And without father, mother, simply by lusty desires, that selection may be wrong and that becomes actually happened. Therefore there is divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In this country the father and the mother, they tell the daughter that "You go out and bring a husband home. You go out and find a young boy and bring him home." And they make them go out in the street to find a husband.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. Sometimes they are advised to do business. I know that. When, in our society, in the beginning, I started marriage, the father, mother, did not like it. Nowadays it has become custom, in India also, let the girl have many friends, but don't marry unless you find out a suitable man. Society degrades. Actually the Indian system is that when the girl is utmost twelve years, not more than that, ten to twelve years, she must be married. And the father would see, not necessarily in every case the boy is rich man or educated. If he's healthy and if he can work, he'll "Take charge." Then fortune, faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> How should we do this in our ISKCON society with these young girls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course, we are not very much concerned with the social affairs, but still, if we can organize society, that will be very good. That will be peaceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Might be possible on the farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Away from the bad social environment of the cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The system is the boys and girls should be married earlier, and they should work, and there should be no divorce. But whether your country law will allow, that is another difficulty. You may introduce something, but the state law may not approve of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think there is any minimum age for marriage, simply the parents have to give their consent under a certain age. There's no minimum age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There is in England. In a lot of countries now there's a minimum age. No, they cannot be married under that age. Women sixteen, men eighteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But with parents' consent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> ISKCON parents, if the girl is fifteen, like you said, fifteen, then the ISKCON parent may give permission, that is legal. Not only that, but our own men, as I have done in Virginia, I have registered as minister in the state, and I can perform marriages. So our own men can register to perform marriages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another difficulty is the boy and the girl, they also do not stick. That is another difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is the biggest one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Every father, he wants his son to stay <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> and become <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So who will be willing to give up their son for marriage at a young age? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You were saying the other day, actually the only solution is if everybody chants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the only solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were experiencing it just now, everyone was so happy chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one can remain without marriage, that is first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Women also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Women also. What is the use of this material husband? Make Kṛṣṇa husband. Kṛṣṇa's prepared to become everything-love Him as husband, love Him as son, love Him, friend. Kṛṣṇa is prepared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I have see in our society that if the preaching is strong amongst the leaders and there's serious chanting, leaders see that everyone is chanting and happily engaged, that there is no disturbance. If the preaching is weak, there is sexual disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the material desire becomes prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Then everyone becomes lusty. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">bora bora phet, lanka dinga ke matta kare het(?)</span> It was translated by a Mr. Roe, a professor in the Presidency College, he translated "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy." When the problems of life is read, then they are melancholy, all these big, big scientists. Ceylon jumping melancholy. Hanumān, one monkey, he jumped over the Ceylon. So other monkeys also, they were very much proud that a monkey jumped over the ocean. And as soon as he was challenged, "Can you jump over?" melancholy. Ceylon jumping melancholy. Big, big monkey, big, big belly. These are the translation by Mr. Roe, a professor of English in Presidency College. So what is the proposal now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We want to discuss about the journal that we are proposing to have from the Institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So Ravīndra-svarūpa Prabhu is going to be the editor, you approved in Māyāpura. We were thinking if you could give us some idea for a title. Because we were thinking so far is that we would have a subtitle, like we have "Back to Godhead" then we have "the Magazine of the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement." So we would have the subtitle, "Bhaktivedanta Institute" or "Journal of the Bhaktivedanta Institute," but maybe you would like to have a title of the journal. So we wanted to know if you had some hint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can title, entitle, <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñāna?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ me paramaṁ guhyaṁ yad vijñāna-samanvitam.</span> What is that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> verse? <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ te 'haṁ pravakṣyāmi tad vijñānam...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Seventh Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is good, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That is a very nice title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, both phenomenal and noumenal, by knowing which there shall remain nothing further to be known."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, nothing further to be known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam.</span> So we can say "<span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam,</span> Journal of the Bhaktivedanta Institute." Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Do we need some sort of translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> On the inside cover we can have this verse...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can give this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Give the verse on the inside. That can be the motto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that nice title?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, sound very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It's a very good title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So in this journal we can publish from different disciplines of knowledge from any branch of knowledge and principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Science, philosophy, economics, sociology. For the scholarly, academic community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, socially you can teach how this <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> how it is scientific. In the society, if there is... Actually we have. Just like why these, maybe so-called scientists, but why the scientists are given so much importance? Because there is a brain. So if you make everyone equal, all <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> then who will be the brain? The brain is required. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So this, not this brain, this brain is <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> brain for everyone. But when the... But just like here is Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara, or you are here. So you are not scientists from the very birth. You have been trained up how to become a scientist. Similarly, the birth is there. Whatever you may be, it doesn't matter. But you have to be trained up how to become first-class brain. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> You have to become truthful, you have to become controller of the senses, you have to become fully aware of things, of God, everything, full knowledge, then you become brain. These people give scientists so much importance because there is brain. Brain, in the society, there must be brain. So without brain how the society can go on? If you simply produce motor mechanics, then? Brain must be there. Just like this is brain, Sanātana Gosvāmī is asking, <span class="Italic">ke āmi, kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya.</span> This is brain. "I don't want some uncomfortable situation, but why it is enforced?" So when you make research into that, that is brain. And if we remain like animal, "All right, they are dragging me to the slaughterhouse, that's all right, let me go," that is not brain. Brain means that I am seeking after perfect happiness, why I am not allowed to have this perfect happiness? That is brain. The question, if there is any remedy. They are doing this. Scientific brain means there are so many problems, they are trying to solve it. That requires brain. But because they are poor scientists, they do not know how to make a solution of the ultimate problem. They are making tiny problems, that's all. There is power shortage, all right, let us invent some substitute of petroleum. Brain is being taxed. Again it is finished, again another. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> But they are so dull brain, they do not raise the question that we are making solution of one problem, another problem is ready. That brain they have not. So how long we shall go on solving the problems, another problem, another problem? <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not know that nature will not allow me to live peacefully. So we bring problems after problems. That is material life. <span class="Italic">Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī.</span> Everything is there. You discuss only <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you'll get so many subject matter to think and write. This is brain. We are solving one problem, another problem is there. Why this is happening? If there is any situation without any problem? That is brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We had another practical consideration. We were thinking, could BBT publish the journal? BBT would publish the journal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But whether you'll be able to publish regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Quarterly, at the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Four times a year. Every three months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it must be very <span class="Italic">sa-vijñānam,</span> it must be very scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Oh, yes. I'll see to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, BBT publish. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We can provide the copy work and all the graphs and things, and then they would lay it out and do everything, like with your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Just like other things. And it will be BBT property. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Your property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We can also do it for the books also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, isn't it? It will be published by BBT, but coming out from Bhaktivedanta Institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That will be good for the Institute if the name is on that book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. From Bhaktivedanta publisher. Yes, that's all right. Can do something like that, there is no harm. But this world is a problem, but we want solution of the problem but we do not know how to solve it. Is it not? Do the scientists know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are trying. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not a single problem they have solved. Can you cite that this big problem they have solved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In fact you have said that they are creating a new problem each time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the nature. You cannot solve the problem. You will create problem. If you don't live natural life, then you will create problem. Just like the other than creatures, other than human beings, they have no problems, because they are living naturally. So our human beings should also live natural life. Then his only problem is birth, death, old age, and... That he will be able to solve. That is the difference. The birds and beasts, they are living natural life, but they have no capacity to solve the problems. They are living a natural life. But the human being has the capacity to solve the problems. Real problem is birth, death, old age and disease. But they do not touch the real problem. Hmm? They avoid it because they cannot solve it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They keep it for the future. They postpone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is postdated check. "You take this million dollar check." "When shall I use it?" "After millions year you can cash it." This kind of propaganda no sane man will accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's like chemical evolution. Million years it will happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Billion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, in a million years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the answer is the chicken is better than you. He can give you life within seven days. Dr. Chicken is better... They are shameless. Not ordinary, because ordinary a human being will become shameful to speak something nonsense. But they are shameless. In that Bengali, <span class="Italic">duḥkhānvita</span>(?) One man, one ear was cut off. So in order to hide his cut-off ear he was keeping this side to the river side and this side to the habitation side. So then again his two ears were cut out. Then there is no question of hiding. Both of them were cut out. So these people are <span class="Italic">duḥkhānvita.</span> When both the ears cut out, there is no shame. They will go on talking all nonsense. Because they are accepted. So many millions of years have passed in the history, nobody could do that, and they are giving hope that life will come after millions of years. Why million? Here is a chicken, he can give life within five days. What credit you'll get after millions of years? But they are <span class="Italic">duḥkhānvita.</span>(?)So shameless they can speak such nonsense and still pass on as scientists. <span class="Italic">Tibocham,(?)</span> I think. <span class="Italic">Duḥkhānvita.</span> No shame, you do not feel that why you are talking nonsense. Am I right or wrong? Here is a chicken, insignificant animal, he is giving life within five days, and we are talking of millions of years, and still we are scientist, Dr. Frog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We are going to use that example in our preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is that these persons, they are holding the... <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> A blind man, he has no eyes, and still, he's leader of other blind men. Is it possible? A blind man, he is blind man, he has no knowledge, and still, he's leading other blind men. This is a very dangerous position. He has no actual knowledge, simply speculating, putting theories and formulas, and they are leaders of the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We have to stop this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise people are misled. It is not the duty of education to mislead people. Real knowledge should be given. To become a great misleader and take some title, that is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The other morning Śrīla Prabhupāda was mentioning about the Institute, the Bhaktivedanta Institute. So is there anything else that your Divine Grace wants to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Institute, you have got sufficient subject matter as I was describing, this original source of life and the planetary system, as you are going to make planetarium. Who can say about so many planets in the sky? Who has got sufficient knowledge? They cannot even give... They think that moon is the nearest planet, but we do not think like that. But still they are unable to give sufficient knowledge about the moon. It is not vacant, it cannot be vacant. We do not find any part of the world vacant. There is living entities. This earth planet is part of the universe, and the moon is also part of the universe. If it is not vacant, how that can be vacant? You have got dust there, we have got dust here; you have got rocks there, here we have got rocks. And why it is vacant? We find in the dust also there is life. When we walk on the beach, it is simply sand, there are so many crabs. They are immediately flying, running, "Here is a man coming. Enter into the hole." So even the dust, in the sand, there is life. So why not there? In the water there is life, within the sand there is life, in the air there is life, everywhere there is life. Why it should be vacant? Hmm? What is the opinion of the scientists? How...? We are layman, talking like layman, but why there should not be life? And in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> we get there is life. Not only moon, every planet is full of living entities. <span class="Italic">Jagat-kīrṇa</span>(?). There is human being, there is animal, everything. How it can be vacant, God's creation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say they cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See..., you cannot see your father, that does not means there is no father who begot you. That is no... They cannot see, do they say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They cannot see that, so they cannot prove by experiment, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Just from experience also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ravīndra-svarūpa:</span> They want to go and see for themselves, so they say they have gone to the moon planet, and they say we have not found life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We say you have not gone. I have not seen you, that you have gone there; you say only. How can I believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> They show pictures and it was on the TV.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also, you have made picture. I have not gone and seen that. How can I believe you? The same argument. You say that you have gone to moon planet, but I have not seen that you have gone there. How can I believe you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Is there some other way we can argue with them, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, let us, now just answer this question that you say you have not seen. I say, yes that's all right, because you did not see, therefore you don't believe. But I did not see you also that you have gone to moon planet. How can I believe you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ravīndra-svarūpa:</span> How is it possible to deceive so many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether it is not possible or possible, but if you put this argument, that I have not seen, I can say that I have... (end)</div>
