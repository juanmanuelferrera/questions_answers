<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...this flavor. Now who can challenge? Apart from other things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But you don't know the real cause scientifically, so you say it is a god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you, you are scientist, but you are a greater rascal. You cannot explain. Wherefrom this flavor has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, we're working on that, and we'll find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But working... But we have got the already conclusion. Why should we work like a fool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That's an excuse because you cannot explain to your children when they come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we are explaining. Kṛṣṇa says, "This is I am." This is God. This is God. You are fool. You are searching after. But we know. Here is God. <span class="Italic">Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "I am this flavor." So as soon as you have this flavor, you understand Kṛṣṇa is there. It is easier. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There was an arti...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the sunshine is there. Here is Kṛṣṇa. So we have no difficulty. <span class="Italic">Prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.</span> Here is <span class="Italic">puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There was now a statement from the scientists, "Scientists are no longer positive why the sun shines." Like... They were positive, and they said, "We are positive." Now they are no longer positive why the sun shines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that, "positive"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They don't know... Before they were sure. Now they're not sure why the sun shines. They had concocted an idea, and they declared it as a law, a scientific law. Now they have..., again doubting their own law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Actually the flavor that's in the flower comes from the different secretion, and by different mixture, different flavors come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, what is that mixture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> By chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By chance. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Different chance creates different flavors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They have scientists have analyzed. All smells come in seven or eight basic smells: burnt, sweet, bitter... So they said, "A rose is seven sweet, two burnt and one bitter." So they take the chemicals, and it doesn't smell like a rose. They put the seven sweet and the one burnt, and... And it doesn't smell rose. But just the statement that they are no longer chemicals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But we can artificially create with our chemicals the smell of the rose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Just like now they have created flowers, plastic flowers that give scent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yeah, sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But they have taken material from the already created, and here's without factory it's made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you ask for an artist to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But there's no seed in the plastic flower, no seeds to create more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The scient... There was a scientific law called Heisenberg's Law of Uncertainty that-'cause this Heisenberg just died, so they wrote his philosophy-that you cannot observe anything and give a conclusive answer to anything that was uncertain. No one can make a decisive statement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are giving this conclusive answer? Why he is giving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is conclu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> All he's saying is like what Socrates..., "I only know that I don't know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In other words, he's in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> In other words, he's admitting that he has limited senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So "I don't know" means that you are rascal. So you know. So why you are preaching? You know that you are a rascal. Then why you are preaching? You are teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They, they showed his picture in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. He said, "I know. I know that I don't know." So if you don't know, that means you are a rascal. So, knowingly that you are a rascal, why you are taking the position of a teacher? That is cheating. You are rascal, cheater. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And his picture is, was with a beer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He wanted to teach everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Einstein was also a drunkard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He would say, "I have taken this position, teacher, because I want everyone to say, 'I don't know.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So just say, "I don't know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you don't know, why say anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult to deal with these rascals. The other day one professor came to see me from Khabudvīpa(?). He was very submissive, but still, he would argue like this, that "Whatever Kṛṣṇa is making me to do, I am doing." So I told him, "Kṛṣṇa is asking you to surrender. Why don't you surrender?" "No, when He will will, I shall surrender."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "He should make me..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There's a story I tell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So there was a man. "Oh, when he wills me to surrender, I'll surrender, and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But He is directly saying, "You surrender." Still, He has to will? Just see the argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He already willed five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, there was a story like that, that a cow ate a man's grasses. So the man beat the cow and the cow died. So Yamarāja came. And he was saying, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa willed me, and I killed the cow. It is all Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">kārya.</span> I did not kill him." So Yamarāja said, "Well, who, who planted this rice?" He says, "I did." "And who purchased this land?" He says, "I did." "And who purchased, who raised that land?" "I did." "Who did that?" "I did. I did. I did." "Now, who killed the cow?" (Prabhupāda laughs) So they want to take credit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...when they do something for their sense gratification, but to sacrifice-"Oh, Kṛṣṇa has to tell me. Kṛṣṇa wills it." Then they don't... They say, "Why did Kṛṣṇa create evil?" Then there is a very peculiar question that comes sometimes: "If Kṛṣṇa knows that we were going to fall down, why didn't He save us?" or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's saving you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> In the West, that is a very popular question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's saving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Why didn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's asking that "You... I'll save you. You surrender to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But that means He knows everything in advance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows. He knows that you are a rascal, you'll fall. Therefore He says that "Do this. You'll not fall."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And they don't seem to take that answer, and they're very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No, they become very embittered: "Why He permits us...? If He is all-loving God, why He permits us to suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, He's not permit... He forbids, but you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> You insist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that you have to understand, that you have got little independence. That... Actually they do not understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No. They're not satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Then they say, "Why He give us independence, then?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... That is the distinction between you and the stone. Otherwise you would have remained as stone. Because you are moving, therefore He has given you the independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> There is also a question in that same line. They say that in the spiritual world we say that everything is peaceful, there is no birth and death, there is no material conditions, so if the conditions in the spiritual world are so nice and everything is spiritually, everything is spiritual, how is it that one can become envious of Kṛṣṇa in such conditions? This is a very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The original sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Why we are envious,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> How is it that, if everything is free from envy, free from bad material elements...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> How is it that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is independence. That is independence. In spite of all these things, because you have got little independence, you can violate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> It is very hard thing to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not difficult. It is not difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It is not difficult. They don't want to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are part and parcel of God, God has got full independence, but you have got little independence, proportionately, because you are part and parcel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, their idea is that they want to blame God for their predicament, like a bad child, you know, says, "Well you made me do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> "What can I do?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they say, "Why you gave me birth?" They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Cursing almost. Almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Also the atheistic people sometimes argue, "What does your Kṛṣṇa do for the suffering people?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "What does He do? Why doesn't He come down and help the poor people? They are suffering."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I tell them there's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "Why doesn't He come and help them?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In Andhra, I said, "There's so much land where they're growing tobacco. You could grow food." But in the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> it says, "Once coming there, he never returns."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he likes, he can return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He can return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That independence has to be accepted, little independence. We can misuse that. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare.</span> That misuse is the cause of our falldown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book it says that there were some color fighting in Dvārakā. They were throwing color. And some men became lusty seeing the women. So is... Will that be the first part of their falldown, to be in Vaikuṇṭha and think of personal lust with Kṛṣṇa's associates?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Whatever He likes, He'll do. That is God. God is not meant for satisfying you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That man was dragged down by the people in the audience anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They took him out of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He was dragged down by the people in the audience. He was an agitator. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This preaching work is a great fight, struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It is very struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are all soldiers. Even if you lay down your life by fighting, you are recognized by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa will see that "This devotee has laid down his life," so He'll... He's... <span class="Italic">Asaṁśayam. Asaṁśayam. Mām evaiśyasy asaṁśayam.</span> So let us go on fighting. Even we die, what is that? We are going back to... <span class="Italic">Jīvo vā māro vā.</span> A Vaiṣṇava, a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> either he lives or dies, he is under the protection of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jīvo vā māro vā.</span> [break] So if he dies in the battlefield, he goes to heaven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] Now, in the past year, though, Communism has come under many attacks in the magazines and newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Communism has been openly attacked as failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Communism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, many places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> There was a recent issue of <span class="Italic">Newsweek.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I... I think, only in the world, that is the real country where people are really starving, in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Russia, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Now they're having drought, and trying to get wheat from a freezing cold land. And they have their favorite class, also. The Party members are only a fraction of the population, and they get all the benefits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So they have their caste system also. It was created out of envy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...for the... That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I have discussed this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Marx's failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...they cannot take the greed out of man. That was right on the head. That is the exact point, that they are suffering for the greed of the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> So they kick out the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> but then they are also more greedy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are greedy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Plus they are low class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Plus the worst thing is that they do not accept any form of religion whatsoever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The, the Russian atheist Communism was because the Christian Church used to favor the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> so they buried them together. In their hatred for the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> the Church also was buried. Very blind, that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that's always been one of the main criticisms against the Catholic Church. They have so much money and land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He said, "Religion is the opiate of the people." So there was a cartoon that Marx came back in 1976, and they said, "No, opium is the religion of the people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "Now opium is the religion of the people because everyone is taking drugs. You say religion is the opiate. Now opium is the religion." They think there should be no private property. There was... They are discussing this in Indian Parliament now. They should abolish private property and abol... Women should not wear ornaments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They're discussing in Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In India, Congress. Ornaments should be banned and private property banned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They have already banned with their land-ceiling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They're doing it by taxing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> With their land-ceiling, they are banning all the..., more than twenty acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They have a law. If you have the high, dry land, you can have fifty acres per person. And if you have wet land, rice growing, irrigated, you can only have twenty-five acres. So I said, "Suppose you have dry land, and then you irrigate..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficulty is that they have no standard idea, their. So they can do anything. And because they are in power, they can pass law whimsically, whatever he likes. [break] ...that <span class="Italic">bābu candra mantrī.</span> (?) You know this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "Many kings and many..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Bābu candra rāya.</span> It is a sarcastic word, <span class="Italic">bābu, bābu candra.</span> Mean a foolish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Foolish king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">bābu candra mantrī.</span> Another foolish <span class="Italic">mantrī.</span> One, one foolish, king; another foolish is ministers. So that is going on. All the rascals, they are getting vote. One is becoming president, another is becoming the prime minister. But both of them are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The, the law they are passing now is that the president and prime minister under no case can be brought in court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right. That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I think that some of the comments of Your Divine Grace, some of the purports of the Fourth Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> if they come to the notice of the Indian government, it may give us some... They may seriously consider about banning, because in that one purport you openly criticize how unfortunate the citizens are because they have a woman as the prime minister, and in another purport you openly say that the citizens should keep their, some of their treasury secret, which is against the principle of their income tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, I have... There is no support in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> There is support, but according to their idea and their so-called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they confront <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Bhāgavatam...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cāṇakya is authority. Otherwise, why you have named "Cāṇakya Purī"? He's as good as Gandhi and other big, big men. So it is said, <span class="Italic">viśvāso naiva kartavyaṁ strīṣu rāja-kuleṣu ca.</span>(?)I am innocent. I am quoting authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. Yes, you can say that is the statement of Cāṇakya. One foolish man... I was saying, "Some...," in my lectures, "some foolish scholar has written that because Kṛṣṇa is black, He is a scheduled caste." So there was a scheduled caste man in the audience who became educated. So he took offense. "Well, maybe Kṛṣṇa was the leader of the scheduled caste." So I said then, "that is the statement of some scholar. You cannot criticize me. I am quoting a scholar." The audience shouted him down too. [break] <span class="Italic">Śūdras</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas</span> may become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> but many of them don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So many born <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> many times.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without making him <span class="Italic">harijana</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> A <span class="Italic">harijana</span> may become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but sometimes a <span class="Italic">harijana</span> is a scheduled caste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harijana</span> means <span class="Italic">methara.</span> As soon as he comes, if he says, "I am <span class="Italic">harijana</span>" then immediately you understand that he is a sweeper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And now, in many cases, they forcibly occupy some land, and they create disturbance, and the local people set fire and drive them out. We call a barber...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Anyone who's not a Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's a <span class="Italic">mūḍha, bās. Narādhama, bās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> We call a barber, and he shaves one, and we said, "Now sharpen again," and he does not bring his stone. "Go back and bring your stone." But even in the free society, American society, they have union. And that is caste. To protect the employment, one union man cannot do the work of another union or he'll put another man out of work. So they stay in their place. So that is <span class="Italic">sva-dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">para-dharma.</span> So the same principle is natural, <span class="Italic">svābhāvika,</span> again appears naturally. Hmm? Just like we... In my house we purchased a piano. One union is hired to bring the piano from the shop to the lorry, another set of workers will lift the piano and put it into the lorry, and another union will take the, from the lorry into your house. So you have to hire about nine different men, because they'll say, "No, now our work is finished up to this point."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. And the other union is the truck driver. And no man will do the other work. Like in India, if you hire a woman to wash the pots, if you tell her to wash the <span class="Italic">pāyakhānā,</span> she will not go. Another woman you have to get. And that protects them. That protects their employment opportunity.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> People confuse change for progress. When it is just changed and done in a more complicated way, they think it is called progress. That is also the Communist thing when there is protest: "Oh, well, you have to accept change. It's natural. It's a natural change."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is communal thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "Times are changing. You have to move. You have to change with the time."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Mao says, "Revolution, constant revolution."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. I asked one man. I said, "What do you have to show? What is the results? What is the results of the change? The people are still living in a hut." He says, "The struggle is what we have to show, that we had a struggle. People are not just sitting by and being exploited, but they are now struggling."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is already found...</div>
