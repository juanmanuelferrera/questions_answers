<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad bhāgavate kiṁ vā paraiḥ.</span> There is no other literature required. Everything is perfect, word to word. What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Kalau naṣṭa-dṛśām?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> <span class="Italic">Eṣa purāṇārko 'dhunoditaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply that is the only light in this age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-bhāgavataṁ purāṇam amalaṁ yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyam.</span> (Bengali) So some professor has... [break] ...with this authorized literature. Somebody has not said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually that is the fact. Therefore we don't like to read any books. Dr. Wolf, he is suggesting... Simply waste of time. Simply waste of time, except Vedic literature, all this nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Place for the crows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> That's all. Not for the swans. They are admitting. Otherwise how it is selling unless they are admitting the value? Maybe a few, but they are realizing. I told you that one young man, very respectable, he came to me in airport, maybe Japan or some place. So he said, "Swamiji<span class="Italic">,</span> can I talk with you?" "And yes, why not?" "Where you have got so vast knowledge?" And "This is not my knowledge. I am simply translating. That's all. It is Vyāsadeva's knowledge. It is not my knowledge." Mean... He appreciated the vast stock of knowledge. That is a fact. And this rascal says, even in India, that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is not written by Vyāsadeva. It is latest, within Christian era.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Written within the last thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You know that? They say like that. So many rascals are there. And this is the only shelter, these, our centers, to be protected from all these rascals. These ISKCON centers are the only shelter. So you have to maintain it very nicely. There is no other shelter. All bogus more or less, all bogus. But you have to, not to... You quote, but the purpose of the verse you present reasonably. If you simply quote, it will not be simply very appealing. "Oh, they are simply..." Sometimes the Westerner criticize that, my Godbrother, Sadānanda? He was criticizing that "Your presentation..." "Your" means our, this Vaiṣṇava literature. "Simply you quote some Sanskrit verse, that's all." So these Sanskrit verses should be explained for understanding of the modern people. If you simply quote, it is not very appealing. In Durban..., Durban? We went to that university. You remember? That <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājī</span>? He was speaking that "This is Hindu conception. Hindu conception." And what do you mean by Hindu conception? A child grows to become a boy. Is that Hindu conception? It is science. When Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> that's a fact. It is applicable to the Hindus, to the Muslim, to the Christian, everyone. Why do you say it is Hindu conception? So you have to present in that way. They may not think that it is Hindu conception. Because they are all rascals, unless you explain it, that this is meant for everyone, they will misunderstand that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is for the Hindus or for the Indians. It is for everyone. But one must realize. There is no question of Hindu conception or Muslim conception. (rattling sound) So this will go on whole day? <span class="Italic">"Cut-cut-cut-cut"?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Morning and evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your party has sold twenty-five thousand big books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> After three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So far this month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-five thousand. I never thought that these books will be so well received. It is beyond my imagination. I thought a few copies may be sold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Remember, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Tamāla, he inaugurated in Seattle, Washington, the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he inaugurated from San Francisco. We were printing these <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> five hundred. And he was most of the... You were selling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually it was 3,500, and we were selling 2,700 of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then Brahmānanda... I asked Brahmānanda. He was in charge. I asked him that "Why don't you print more?" I understood that he has got the potency to sell more. So print in regular way, in that way we arranged. What is that press?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, mimeograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mimeograph. I was printing. Yes. Then he inquired this Dai Nippon, many place. At last he said that "Unless we print twenty thousand, they will not take up this work." I said, "Immediately take it." From three thousand to twenty thousand immediately. At that time they were giving us ten cent or less than.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Ten cent. It was around ten cents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in this way. Then how you'll increase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now you can sell whole sets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now more than one million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And in the years to come, many millions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Many millions in the years to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is good pote...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Many people ask for bound volume of the whole year, <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is no remnants; we sell everything. Generally when there is some remaining copies, the publisher bound it up for future sale, reference. [break] <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> that is the topmost philosophy. So that first verse, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> In this human form of life there is no other business-simply to inquire about Brahman. This is the fact. If anyone wants to fulfill the human form of life as distinguished from animal life, this is the only business, <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> And the whole civilization is on this basis. Therefore first <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> how to understand Brahman. So the children of human society is trained up, same principle, how to understand Brahman. So yesterday with that gentleman I told, "Where you got the sand?" Our beginning talk was that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where you got the?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sand, yes, yes. Yesterday morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I knew it, that they were preparing some sand, because Dr. Bose had a bottle factory. So he was melting the sand. Therefore I asked him. You cannot manufacture anything. You simply collect the ingredients given by God and you can transfer into some other form. You cannot manufacture. This building is also the same way. You have got the cement, the wood, the iron. Wherefrom you have got that? It is Kṛṣṇa's property. So those who are manufacturing or constructing big, big houses for their living, they are simply eating their sinful activities. <span class="Italic">Ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt</span> [Bg. 3.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are also... They can say that "You are also con..." But we are not doing it for ourself. It is for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> apparently looks the same activity, but one is for Kṛṣṇa, another is for one's personal use. <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpāḥ.</span> What is that verse? You know? <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt.</span> Hm? What is that book? Oh. Today there is no fog, or there is, that side, fog. [break] ...all convinced that our only business is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Huh? That is required. We have no other business. "We" means we human beings. We have no other business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, when someone comes to the stage of being convinced like that, that there is no other business, what is that stage called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called <span class="Italic">svarūpa-siddhi. Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> This realization, that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa," this stage. And from here Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching begins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very exalted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. So you have to preach all over the world that "You are simply wasting time by so many department of knowledge. You are so foolish, rascal." <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply wasting time. I think I explained that to that gentleman last morning? He said in one hour, two hour you should devote... Not two hour. Twenty-four hour. Did I not say? Yes. Because that is the only business. We have no other business. Our Society is practically demonstrating that this is the only business and no other business. We therefore do not try even to earn our livelihood. That is the natural instinct of every animal. But we do not try even for that. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Transcendental platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let them see practically. We are not busy how to go to the office, how to the business place. We are not interested. We are simply interested for <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati,</span> for class, for chanting, dancing. That's all. Practically see. We are not going to any office or any business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yet we're still living in a palace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let them see it. We are living in such a palace that everyone is envious. They ask in America that "You people, you do not do anything. How do you live so, like this?" Do they not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The storekeeper says. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And when we tell them, "We will also teach you how to do nothing also and live in a palace," they say, "Oh, no, thank you. That I do not want. I want to work hard."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is called worms of the stool. You see? If you take this worm from the stool, "Why you are living in stool? Come here," "No, no. I go back there." You'll see. The pig eating stool, ask him, "Take <span class="Italic">halavā.</span> Why you are eating?" "No, no. I like it very much." This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So sometimes when a devotee goes, joins Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then leaves again and goes back to the material world, its just like a pig going back to the stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The materialism and spiritualism is explained by Rūpa Gosvāmī. There is bird, <span class="Italic">cātaka.</span> So they drink water when the rain falls, and otherwise they will starve. They will never accept any water from this earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is actually such a bird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A devotee will never accept materialism, even if he dies of starvation. You'll see so many still. They are sticking to this principle. There are still many saintly persons in India. They do that. They don't care for any bodily care. "Some food comes; I shall eat. Never mind." Still you'll find. They are sitting in their place and chanting or meditating without any concern for bodily necessities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We see, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you also have no such concern, but just to deliver the whole world you are taking on this concern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is for Kṛṣṇa. We are constructing the buildings and begging money or..., and..., only for this purpose: people may become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the only idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that <span class="Italic">bhajanānandī </span>and <span class="Italic">goṣṭhyānandī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhajanānandī</span> is not so important than <span class="Italic">goṣṭhyānandī. Bhajanānandī</span> is doing for himself, and <span class="Italic">goṣṭhyānandī </span>is doing for all living being. If you prepare some <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for you, and if you prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for mass of people, then who is better? <span class="Italic">Rasagullā</span> is good, but if you prepare for yourself only, then that is also good. But one who is preparing for so many hundreds and thousands is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was just reading a verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> this morning. There's a... I don't know the Sanskrit, but the English is, "He who works for the welfare of others." Part of the verse mentions like that. "A liberated soul works for the welfare of others."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> But some people, especially here, they can understand you prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullās</span> for the mass of people, but they don't like that you prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> They want that you should prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for the mass of people but they don't like it if you're preparing <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> to give to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vivekananda, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> The answer is that if you do not prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for Kṛṣṇa, then there will be no supply of <span class="Italic">rasagullā.</span> So everything will be finished. Because <span class="Italic">bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt</span> [Bg. 3.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who is preparing <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for himself or expanded himself, so they simply become implicated with sinful activities. So if you are... Suppose if you prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> stealing from the shopkeeper sugar and..., then how long you will go on? One day you'll be captured. <span class="Italic">Stena eva sa ucyate [Bg. 3.12].</span> What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Stena eva sa ucyate.</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Yajña-puruṣa.</span> Real point is to satisfy. You cannot supply <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> but if you supply <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> as <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then the <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span>-eater is benefited, you are benefited, and Kṛṣṇa is pleased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But some devotees say that "In cooking <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> for Kṛṣṇa and the masses, I got my hand burnt. So now I want to practice on my own how to make <span class="Italic">rasagullā.</span> When I become expert, then again I'll make for the masses."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can prepare for Kṛṣṇa so that your hands will be saved. Because you are thinking in that way, that "Let me prepare for myself," therefore your hands is burned. <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt</span> [Bg. 3.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's seven o'clock now, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to go down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not have to. Whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We like what you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there will be rain. And if there is rain now, it is good. For these food grains. It is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Good for everything but the <span class="Italic">masuri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, <span class="Italic">masuri</span> is not very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is <span class="Italic">masuri</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Lentils.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it's not good for construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, no, it won't be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it will not continue. A few hours in a day, stop. <span class="Italic">Yadi varṣe māghera śeṣa, daṇḍa-rājā puṇya-deśa.</span> This is the month of Māgha. So at the end of Māgha, if there is little rain, then it is to be understood that the king of that country is very pious and blessed. This time a little rain is required. <span class="Italic">Yadi varṣe māghera śeṣa, daṇḍa-rājā puṇya-deśa.</span> There is a book, <span class="Italic">Khanāra Vacana,</span> astronomical prediction in this small verses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Pradyumna Prabhu had a copy of that book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Khanāra Vacana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I was looking at it. It was very practical. Even how to... How many feet you should plant the different trees, banana and others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Khanā was a woman, very intelligent. Wife... I think she was wife of Varāha Mihira. He was very great astrologer, and she learned from her husband, and then she explained in common language. That is <span class="Italic">Khanāra Vacana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This <span class="Italic">Khanāra Vacana.</span> She was... I think so... I don't know whether... She was the wife of a great, a very big astrologer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> There was nine <span class="Italic">ṛṣis</span> of one <span class="Italic">rājā,</span> and then she was the daughter of one of those <span class="Italic">ṛṣis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, maybe, daughter or wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Wife of a..., also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's amazing how everything is so scientifically analyzed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The Westerners...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we say "perfect." <span class="Italic">Śruti-pramāṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even to the point of knowing about a certain amount of rain coming at the end of a particular season and how that indicates about the administration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, everything. <span class="Italic">Daṇḍa-rājā puṇya-deśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] "...whether you have got such buildings, whether you have got such books, whether you have got such disciples, whether you have traveled so..."? Then what they will, will be reply? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But they've got the <span class="Italic">āśīrbād.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Oh. They say that due to their <span class="Italic">āśīrbād</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, he is saying that he is the counterpart, that he's got the <span class="Italic">āśīrbād.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">āśīrbād,</span> but what you have done for the <span class="Italic">āśīrbād.</span> You are licking up the <span class="Italic">āśīrbād.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> He is also. [break] Vedic conception is that the birds and beasts, they should not be driven away. Let them eat as much as it like. They must eat also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we shouldn't do that in our field?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the Vedic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Then we won't have anything to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you produce more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> What ha... In the... Because now this field is the only field that is ripening, so that if he doesn't scare the bird away, all the bird will come and eat his field. When all the wheat is ripening at the same time, then nobody cares. They let the birds eat. But if one man only is growing one crop at one time, then all the birds come. They will clean out and they all get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore everyone should grow seasonal grains. Everyone should take wheat. I think the number of men is more than the number of bricks. [break] ...rooms will be finished. They are not being finished. This? [break] ...Calcutta. So landlords became very perplexed.
