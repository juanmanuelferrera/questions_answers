<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This man is unemployed, and if we engaged him for plowing, will he do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I don't think so. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That's too hard, that's work. "We don't want to work like that, we just want some easy job."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That would mean they had to leave the city. They don't want to leave the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then go to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we received news yesterday that one man in northern New South Wales is willing to sell us a farm, a great big farm out there in the southern tropics. Would this be a good place for engaging boys like the Indian, the Indian boy that came yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our next program is to organize farming. Let anyone come. We shall give him free food and employment: "Come on." Not that "I want to work as a clerk in the city." You produce your own food. I give you ingredients. I give you land. And work for five, six hours, and take your food and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Anybody who comes to the farm has to agree to follow the four regulative principles? These people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise you are not coming. Our main business is to make him Kṛṣṇa conscious. Where you have left my that overcoat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That is in London. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] How they will serve? The proposal...[break] that how... [break] ...they have disco... [break] They have discovered so many machine, so many factories, so many... So how they will relieve the mankind? This proposal Vivekananda used, to serve the mankind. How they will serve? In spite of all arrangement there are so many suffering humanity, so many unemployment, so much disease, so much death. So what is the meaning of this serving? Huh? You cannot stop it. That is the nature's way. How you can stop by so-called bluffing that "We are serving the humanity"? You are opening hospital. Does it mean that the suffering is reduced? Because the suffering has increased therefore your number of hospitals have increased. Where is the mitigation? Nature's way, we are feeling pain, this cold wind. Who can stop it? And where is the question of decreasing human's suffering or stopping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> By our technological inventions we can make a heater that makes the coldness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the heater is not curing the suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But it makes us warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But a heater, how many men will get heater?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, we can make them cheaply so that practically everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can, but you do not, neither you can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But in this country everyone, all these houses have heaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the... Why do you take in this country? Why not other country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, so many countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where? That is simply bluff. You cannot do it. Cannot do it. Suffering must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, we accept the suffering is there, but we will still try to reduce it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reduce...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> By inventing so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another bluffing. You have already invented so many things. Where is the reduction of suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, there are less diseases, we are finding so many cures now that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't find less diseases. You are increasing hospitals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Well, now we're taking care of the diseased people. Before, no one ever took care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Like in India, for example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Even if you take care, what is the result? You have to increase hospitals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, that's cause the population is increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Just like in Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore your proposal is failure. You increase your, what is called, amenities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The population increases. The proportion remains the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But we're taking care of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> At least we're helping them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are taking care of them, but the population increasing, therefore you cannot take care of every one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, yes, because we increase our hospitals therefore we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, you are increasing and population increasing, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> And then we keep increasing according to the population.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then go on struggling. That is struggling. There is no question of decreasing. Proportionate. Proportionately, you increase the amenities, and proportionately the distress increases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It's just like in some countries the diseased men, they suffer in the street, but here we give them a nice place to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They can suffer in a nice warm hospital...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are increasing this cancer. Very comfortable at home, but there is cancer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But now we have almost got the cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have, all right. My point is that you have so many things, but the suffering is going on. That is my point. You increase your means of diminishing suffering, but they are coming in a different way. So the sufferings cannot be stopped. That is not possible. This is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But we're learning how to enjoy even the suffering, make the best of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Best use of a bad bargain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another bluff. That is another bluff. But then don't say that "We shall stop suffering." You can say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> No, we don't say we can stop it, but we can almost stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Minimize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not minimize. If you are increasing hospital, where is the minimizing? Every state is increasing hospitals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yeah, well that's part of the minimization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Fools cannot be convinced. We are helpless to convince. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Actually some of the hospitals are very nice places. They are very comfortable for the patients, and they enjoy it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are thinking that it is very comfortable, but the patient is not thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But we have experience where the patient doesn't want to leave because there is such nice facilities in our hospitals, color television, recreational rooms...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Nice nurse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you become patient and go to the hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Just like in our prisons, sometimes the prisoners, they don't want to leave because they don't have to work and they're getting food. They have a bed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> We can teach people how to live with their problems and at the same time learn how to minimize them through technology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because you have got so many facilities to teach people that "You become patient, you become criminal, and you live comfortably." That is very nice, "You become criminal, go to the jail and live very comfortably." "You become diseased, go to the hospital and live comfortably." That is very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But see, they can't cause any trouble in the jail. That is the advantage. Therefore everyone is comfortable because they see that the murderers are locked up and they can't do any harm. Therefore everyone is feeling safe. And in a hospital people, similarly, they have some disease. They can't... Like in India, the beggars on the street, they should all be in hospitals, whereas in the foreign countries all those type of people are all in hospitals, taken care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why hippies are lying on the street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, that is voluntary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, one side, you make arrangement for patient; another side, they voluntarily suffer. Then what you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No, that is their happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, they are enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It's not suffering to them. They are very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are thinking they are unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Even the police try to make the hippies get off the street, and they say, "No, no, we like it here. We want to stay."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you want to minimize their suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> No, we will let the hippies lie there, but for the sick people who are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the difference, a hippie lying on the street and in India some patient is lying on the street? What is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> According to the person's desire, we facilitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, go on, waste your time. Your philosophy is that "If they feel pleasure lying on the street, so let them lie down." That is your philosophy. Then why do you endeavor for others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, if they feel pleasure, then we can also let them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is then relative. When you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes. According to the person's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> We just want to see that everyone is happy, and that way we will know that we are pleasing God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is happy. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says, <span class="Italic">śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ.</span> Now, something is happiness; the same something is distress. So what is the standard of happiness? The same something is distress for another. One man's food, another man's poison. So where is the standard of happiness? What you are thinking, "This is happiness," others are thinking, "This is distress."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That's why we have this modern philosophy that whatever makes you feel good you should do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then everyone will think they don't require philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> In this world everything is relative, so it's not expected that the same things will please everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you put something as happiness standard or distress standard? So everything is everything, that's all. (laughs) Why do you try to put a standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> We try to simply make the facility if a person wants to change his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are so much busy in trying like that? Why you are waste your time? You make your own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But that is his happiness. Giving facility to others is what makes me happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he doesn't want to... Just like if you want to give facility to the hippies-"Please come in nice home"-he will not accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No, but we don't want to give to the hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> For those who want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot give happiness to everyone according to standard. Then unhappiness will continue, so what is the use of your wasting time? Because you cannot give happiness to everyone, what you think, "It is happiness," others will not accept it. Then where is the happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> We can give them what they want, and that will make them happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is contradictory. One mans want poison; you give him poison. One man wants food, you give him food. Then what is the standard of your food or poison? Then everything is required. Why do you bother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, we have to draw the line somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do it foolishly. That is another thing. But everything is all right. Poison is all right, and food is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The standard is the person's happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Just like now we have come to the point where the different doctors are thinking very seriously of having this mercy killing passed in the courts. When a person becomes too much diseased, actually he would be happier if he was dead, so why not kill him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is contradictory. He will kill somebody, and he will give life somebody. That is... There is no standard. Everything is all right. Then why do you bother that "This is good"? The same "good" is bad for others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's why we have psychiatrists, to decide... They analyze the person very carefully and see what is good for him. And completely on a relative basis they give a prescription.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you think what is good for you? Why you are so busy for the good of others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Well that's this particular person's happiness, is seeing that others are happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The same happiness is distress for others. Then what is the use, bothering yourself, "This is happiness; this is distress"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Because that is what makes me happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> We understand it is relative. Therefore we're working in a relative world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, do that. Madman's program. That is Vivekananda, "Everything is all right." "Everything is all right"-then why do you preach? You stop your preaching. Everything is all right. What is the use of saying that "This is good; this is bad"? Everything is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> We preach that way so that other people will be happy knowing everything is all right. Now they're thinking everything is not all right, so they're in anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a story. One man has written book how to tend cows. "Cows tending, cows tending, cows tending." So one old man calling, "What book you are selling?" "How to tend the cows." "So you better take this book to your mother. She will learn how to tend you." Cows tending everyone knows, and he has written a book. "So better... You are a rascal cow. Give it to your mother, and she will tend you, learn." It is like that. If everything is all right, somebody is taking, "This is pleasure," somebody..., then what is the use of writing book? Everything is all right. They may select whatever they like. Oh, why you are becoming a big preacher? Let them accept whatever they like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But some people have a hard time getting what they like. Therefore we like to help them. We feel that it's our duty as human beings to help them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this duty is that you better go to your mother. All nonsense theory. It has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> If everything is all right, then my preaching that is also all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your preaching is all right, so, provided you preach something good. But when everything is good, then where is the, your preaching required? You preach something. Just like we are preaching. We are preaching. This is actually good for, that he must know what he is and what is the ultimate goal of life. This is required. Material preaching has no value. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Ei bhāla ei manda, saba manodharma:</span> " 'This is good; this is bad,' this is all mental concoction." Actually. But real good is: "He has forgotten God. Revive his consciousness." That is real good. Then he'll saved from the so-called good and bad and everything. That is wanted. Materially, everything is one man's food, another man's poison. Therefore there is no distinction-"This is good; this is bad." The stool is very bad, bad smell for you, but it is food for the pig. This is proof-"One man's food, another's poison." So this is only mental concoction, "This is good; this is bad."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Everything is good; everything is bad-materially. The real good for him, that he has forgotten his spiritual identification; revive him to that consciousness. That is real good. Somebody brings just now bucketfuls of water, and if he proposes "I shall drench you," "No, no, no, don't you drench me." But you will find-we are going-the ducks, as soon as they..., immediately jump on the water. So whether water is good or bad? It is all relative. So don't bother about this good and bad. It is simply mental concoction. (pause) You can bring me breakfast at eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Eight o'clock. All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not so early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> And no mango for breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You said that the man will not like this kind of job. Eh? Therefore there must be division of job. That is <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He does not want to produce his own food. If you give him some salary, then he will be satisfied. And then he will work with plow also. If you give him salary, he will accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Actually in the West, more or less, that system, the division system, is accepted because we have businessmen, we have labor men, we have politicians, we have teachers and professors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My wrapper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yeah, this is the new wrapper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New wrapper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> I got for you in Vṛndāvana. I'd gotten it in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With that border?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No, no, that's this. See there are two wrappers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Both of them are new.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says that if a man simply works for Kṛṣṇa, he can come to the perfect stage. Is that perfect stage... When he fixes his mind on Kṛṣṇa... But is that achieved via the regulative principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If a man simply works for Kṛṣṇa for his whole life, yet he doesn't follow the regulative principles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how he follows Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are following Kṛṣṇa, then how you can violate the regulative principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just like they follow a few regulative principles, like the basic four: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, and no intoxication. If they follow those four regulative principles and just work for Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He doesn't follow the four principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Oh, yes. Yes. There's this one devotee in Sydney who works very hard for Kṛṣṇa, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But does not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He does not like <span class="Italic">āratis</span> or things like that. He just likes to work hard all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He follows the principles, but he doesn't go to <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> maybe he doesn't chant his rounds, but he's working...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Real hard for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like Gargamuni. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes, like that. And his plea is that Kṛṣṇa says...</div>
