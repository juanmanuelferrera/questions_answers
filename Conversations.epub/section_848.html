<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (tape very distorted) They are not beggar. But Kṛṣṇa has assured, <span class="Italic">yoga-kṣemaṁ vahām...</span> Why they should go to beg? That this is only a process to approach them. If you approach any gentleman as beggar, he'll give you, at least in India. Not.... Just to enlighten, give them education. [break] He's thinking, "This is life." And the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>'s duty is: "No, not this is life. You are in darkness, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>" That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>'s business: to enlighten. [break] ...everything, and only for understanding future, they'll be left on the hand of the nature. Is that very good proposal? Hmm? No. There must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But they have process. They earn wealth. That's all. And no future for the child, they don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have no education. The guru's duty is to give them education; the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>'s duty is to give.... They do not give. They say, "Yes, you are all right. Give me some money." That's all. That they go: "I am <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> I am this, I am that," that's all. And he is.... He return (indistinct) to darkness. That's all. [break] ...they used to discover, whole method is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, yeah. During the war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. So sinful means punishment. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our point is that we are going to live in the future. So if, becoming modern, we forget our future, then what is the use of becoming modernized? Better remain primitive. The business is that in future also we shall exist. If we do not know how we shall exist-either I shall exist as a cat, as a dog, or a tree, or a demigod, or as associate of Kṛṣṇa.... If I do not know.... On account of being modernized, if I remain in darkness about my future, so it is better to remain primitive. What is the use of becoming modernized and forget myself and my future? Becoming modernized, if I become dog in future, so what is the use of modernized? The real business is that I shall take care of my future. Especially in the human form of body. Cats and dogs, they do not know about future. If I know there is future, I have a future.... This is also said by Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ: [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> "In future." Not this body, another body. So is it not my first business, to prepare what is my future body? That is my first business? Or to drink R.C. (Royal Crown?) my first business? Just see. By drinking R.C. if I, next life I become a dog, then what is the use of modernized life? And if we, by remaining in primitive state, we can produce Vyāsadeva, oh, it is better. But the fools have no sense. Suppose if I go to some place for some business, and going there, to select my hotel, which hotel I shall enter, I remain busy to find out the hotel, and I forget the business for which I have gone there, then am I not madman? A human life is meant for deciding his future. If we do not care for the future, and if I want to become modernized from primitive life, is that very good inclination? Real business forgotten, but I am busy with modernized life. That example I give sometimes, (Bengali). That one has to go to see a fair on account of (Bengali). So women, they generally dress themself very nicely. So the woman say to his friend that "You dress." So dressing, dressing, dressing.... In the meantime, the fair finished. So the modern civilization is like that. (Bengali) I have to go to see the fair, but I became so much attentive in dressing that in the meantime news came, "The fair is finished." That is our civilization. A human life is meant for preparing for the next life. That is sensible. But I am so much busy in manufacturing things for modernized life, R.C., T.C., P.C., and so on, so on. In future, at the time of death, I begin to bark and I think, "Oh..." And nature will say, "All right, come on." "No, no, I'm not going to..." No, why not? You have become modernized, barking like dog. So you bark. Who will check that? <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā... [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">. māyā</span> will take consideration, "What you have made yourself, a dog or god?" That she will take account. If you have made yourself a dog, "Just come on, become a dog." If you have made yourself as god, then "Come on, you'll be demigod." That is for everything. Otherwise why there are varieties? There is dog life and there is demigod life, Indra life. It is not one-sided. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> it is not one-sided. You have to change your body. And there are varieties of life, so it is up to you what kind of body you have got. You can change your body up to the point of becoming associate of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām [Bg. 9.25]. Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma... [Bg. 15.6].</span> These informations are there. So if you have to prepare for the next life, why not go back to home, back to Godhead? <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante.</span> This is intelligent? Or to become modernized and become a dog next life? Which is intelligent? The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "No, this is intelligent." What? <span class="Italic">Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This life should be utilized for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> to purify your existence. That is the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Śāstra</span> does not say you become modernized. What is this modernized? Simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Polished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Polished dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actual modernized means how far you have advanced in spiritual consciousness. That is wanted. (drinks or eats) It does not taste exactly <span class="Italic">dahl,</span> I think, due to the new (indistinct) water in it. So is there any engagement? Somebody was to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Was to come, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not coming. Who is not modernized? They will go to the dancing party for their salvation. (laughter) Dog dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Today is Sunday. Everyone is busy with their family, family, society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know this Ravi Shankar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Umm hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His elder brother, Udar Shankar, he became very famous man as a dancer, all over the world. Udar Shankar. And by imitating his brother, the Ravi Shankar also tried to become first-class sitarist. So family.... [break] ...was a little famous for artistic.... So that Udar Shankar was dancing in the Indian way, and there are many sculpture of dancing. Like that. That was his art. So he became famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He's not living? He's dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's dead means now he's old man. He's about my age or little older than me. Now his skin has become slackened and body is not so strong to dance. It requires exercise. Therefore he's retired, I think, maybe dead. But I don't hear his name. He was more or less known in Europe as Shankar. But he was so popular that one my doctor friend.... He was educated in London, a medical officer of Allahabad. So he told me that "I saw that in Paris, Udar Shankar's dancing was advertised, and hundreds and thousands of people from England going to Paris, crossing the Channel to see him dance." He showed me. He's so popular. And now nobody asks for him. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Another bubble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Another bubble. I remember when Ravi Shankar and George Harrison came to see you in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> The first thing you asked them was "You are very famous, but what will you be next life? What is your guarantee for the next life?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> And I don't think any other guru would have asked that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is guru? <span class="Italic">Goru,</span> you say <span class="Italic">goru.</span> When it is pronounced guru, I say, you say, don't say guru, but you say <span class="Italic">goru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Goru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Goru,</span> no, do you know <span class="Italic">goru</span>? <span class="Italic">Goru</span> means cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Cow. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Otherwise they're going to find out, then don't say <span class="Italic">goru.</span> Guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Goru</span> means cow. <span class="Italic">Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma. Śrī-guru.</span> (laughs) So they're all <span class="Italic">gorus,</span> nobody guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All rascals. Now that Ravi Shankar has become George guru. Somebody.... You were telling me? That this boy has been taught to take the dust of the feet of Ravi Shankar in the stage, and people did not like it. So he has become unpopular accepting a <span class="Italic">goru.</span> (end)</div>
