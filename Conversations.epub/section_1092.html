<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He made another point that in Krishna Shankar Sastri's compiling of the commentaries, commentators, that Śrīdhara Svāmī is given the first position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> But he says that is because he was the first. But it does not mean he was the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) It's nonsense. Unless one is best why he should be given first? Any... If there is any meeting, the most important man is given the first position. At least out of respect. Everyone has given first position. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore praised. What is his nonsense arguments?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> There are two other versions of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> There also, Śrīdhara Svāmī has been considered the best commentator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepts. <span class="Italic">Svāmī nā māne yei jana veśyāra bhitare.</span> Everyone has given. Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, <span class="Italic">iti svāmī caraṇa kahe.(?)</span> Jīva Gosvāmī, all authorities, they accept. And why they are criticizing Śrīdhara Svāmī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That is the main point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the main point. If you can criticize Śrīdhara Svāmī, then your criticism, why you take the criticism. Then others, you must be judged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Because all of the (indistinct) gurus, they are all devotees now, all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what they are going to answer to this? Will you accept everything? Ask them. So when the (indistinct), but exposes you, what answer you have got? Why you are silent? Silent means acceptance. <span class="Italic">Maunam</span> (indistinct). If I say, "You are rascal, you are thief," and if you don't reply that means you accept it. <span class="Italic">Maunam</span> (indistinct). If you do not protest, and if you do not say anything, so such a big criticism from (indistinct) and they are silent. Why do they not go to the court? Bluff (indistinct). That means he accepts. (indistinct) has been made here? (static-very indistinct for some time) (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> He was here also with (indistinct) Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another (indistinct) also. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> He is son of (indistinct) Mahārāja, but he is very envious. Very, very envious. I went to him, I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are envious of the <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya Sampradāya.</span> Because of (indistinct) Since a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But they cannot say anything against <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya Sampradāya</span> because Vallabhācārya glorified Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They cannot say anything against Caitanya Mahāprabhu because Vallabhācārya glorified Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He has written to (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. He made another point, that is Vallabhācārya actually considered Caitanya Mahāprabhu as his superior. Then after this incident, still, he criticized Śrīdhara Swami. So that means he did not accept Caitanya Mahāprabhu as superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of accept. He was plainly defeated. Because he said that (indistinct). Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted his invitation after this. He also invited and he also (indistinct) ...talk like that. Not only that, Caitanya Mahāprabhu criticized, but as soon as Vallabhācārya invited, He accepted. There was no enviousness. Rather friendly, sometimes they call others are (indistinct). Otherwise why Caitanya Mahāprabhu would accept invitation from Vallabhācārya. But they are habituated to criticize (indistinct). That Caitanya Mahāprabhu chastised him: "Why should you think like that?" In a friendly way. (indistinct) They are still criticizing Śrīdhara Swami, and if others criticize them, "Why you are criticizing Śrīdhara Swami?" There is no answer. This is the position. (indistinct-only fragments of conversation audible for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have no (indistinct) because they even refute one other in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> They would criticize that Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja made mistakes when he wrote the C<span class="Italic">aitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, he said that he didn't know he wrote the wrong version in the section about Vallabhācārya and that the real version is somewhere else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, well they don't accept the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) They don't accept, we don't accept you. The whole world is accepting <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> (indistinct) all over the world, not just (indistinct). All over the world. (indistinct-fragmentary for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They're having a ceremony of bringing the flag.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. From the Nathadwar, Bombay, at some place. They invited us to do <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may go. You have no...? You can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last time they would not let us distribute our magazines when they had it in Shrimati Morarji's house. They had the same ceremony in Shrimati Morarji's house here about a year ago and they didn't like our book distribution there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What this time where it will be held?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> This is an organization. Last time was Shrimati Morarji's personal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Private house. This is organized function you ask them a place to show our books. If they deny then we don't go. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> This one parade in Los Angeles, the Rose Bowl, they distribute thousands of books on this one day. What happens is all the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> get out there, sometimes the night before, at least very, very early in the morning. They line both sides of the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> To see yes. Approximately a million people. About a million people, they're just lining both sides of the road and the street is empty before the parade. So this year we're going to have the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> boys do a <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and go right up the road. So one million people will see the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> And then it will be on television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> It will probably be on television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have a similar parade in Melbourne like that called a Moomba. Three-quarters of a million people come for it and the whole city closes down. And they line up and down the main road and then they have a parade of floats. So they invited that we could put a float in so Bali Mardana said he would try and get the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> cart in. Three-quarters of a million people seeing Lord Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Why don't you do that in Los Angeles? (end)</div>
