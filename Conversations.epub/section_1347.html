<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We should begin the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Because quite honestly, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think most of us are very worried. If you go off down the road and send us all back to our different assignments, we would not be able to serve with our full attention, knowing that our beloved father and spiritual guide was in such weak condition. So if we begin in Vṛndāvana, we're all here now, we can see so that we know what arrangements to make for the future when you want to leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You make me flat. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We heard that Your Divine Grace had a dream that a <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> of the Rāmānuja-sampradāya would treat you and bring you back to strength, and this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> says that in a very short time, following the treatment, you would regain your strength. Although he hasn't got all of the medicines yet, but within a day or two they'll all be prepared, and he says within fifteen days you should be quite improved in strength. So far, he seems to have been quite sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he's sincere. I'll drink milk. Whatever strength is obtainable, there will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Like to follow the same treatment, only while traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So we should meet and make a program for going around Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You want to begin tomorrow morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If Prabhupāda travels in a van it would be very bumpy. He should have a big bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Let's discuss it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> A big bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, bus will be not good. Bullock cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Bullock cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That is very bumpy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Your Guru Mahārāja used to have bullock cart travel from Hulorghat [on the bank of the Ganges in Māyāpura] up to the Caitanya Maṭha. You told me you put a nice mattress down in the back and a cover, and you lay down there. You even told me once to go to Calcutta that way. You lay down, at night; you go little bit, little bit; and in the morning, when you wake up, you're in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bullock, you get the cow dung.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cook with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> In this part of India it's very cold now for Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Underneath the tree it is not cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You sound like you are very determined to go, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Daytime we expose in the sunshine, and camp underneath a tree at night. That has to be arranged. (Bengali with Bhakti-caru-Prabhupāda drinks something)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, should the devotees take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's about 1:30 now. After taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> we can meet and chalk out a program for <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> and <span class="Italic">tīrtha-yātrā.</span> Is that all right? Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I thought you have taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we were all surrounding you, listening very intently to all your instructions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> has been saved for the devotees that are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Three o'clock we'll meet. So we'll have our meeting, Śrīla Prabhupāda, with Lokanātha also present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Satsvarūpa also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm? Yes. And then we'll begin tomorrow. Is that soon enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should we depart for taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is attending?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Upendra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Upendra is very good attendant. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were discussing how to make this <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> possible, and we've concluded that the best thing was, as we said earlier, to <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> around Vṛndāvana to begin with. And for that purpose we sent Lokanātha Mahārāja and Pañca-draviḍa Mahārāja and Trivikrama Mahārāja to get a bullock cart ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hired or purchased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, for now just hired, not purchased. Later on we can make a more permanent arrangement, and it can be fixed up as nicely as possible. At the same time while we were meeting, the <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he also was present. So we inquired from him what he thought about this program, from a medical point of view of course. Spiritually he is in complete agreement. So from a medical point of view, he said that you would not at all be able to withstand this kind of a trip. He said that in a bullock cart, moving around, bumping on the road, you might not be able to live more than a couple of hours. He's here now. He wanted to speak to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Lokanātha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Lokanātha has already gone, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He has gone to Mathurā for renting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has gone out for renting the bullock cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lokanātha says that the bullock cart could probably go around Vṛndāvana in about five to six hours, parikramming Vṛndāvana town.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make an experiment. Then we shall decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda said, "Make an experiment. Then we shall decide."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> What is that experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayapatākā's asking what that experiment is, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda said, "Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">parikrama</span>."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda, does it mean with Your Divine Grace, or we should go alone first and see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Does it mean that Your Divine Grace will come on the experiment, or we should go without Your Divine Grace and experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> See if the road is very rough, if the road is passable by bullock cart the whole way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bullock cart is not smooth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bullock cart is not smooth. How would you propose that we go, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come, let us take the risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Go anyway. Let us take the risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> As your disciples, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we're all neophytes. We don't know what is right and what is wrong. But at the same time we feel that we're very hopeful that you'll get strength slowly and slowly. And this morning you were telling us that you get a little strength, so we are hoping every day that "Prabhupāda will gain even stronger and be with us for many more years." So we are taking advice from <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> that you take milk more and more, day by day, so that Prabhupāda will get stronger. Like <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is suggesting that when Your Divine Grace gets stronger, he'll go with you in the <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> he will accompany you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us make experiment in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Shall we do that immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Shastriji's saying that he shouldn't do it under the circumstances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if we follow the <span class="Italic">kavirāja's</span> instructions and advice, then he feels that within fifteen days, twenty days, you will have strength. To take an unnecessary risk at this time, we have to practically appraise what will be the loss. You have said, "If I live or die on this <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> it will be glorious," but the loss will be that <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> will not be finished, so many works will be unfinished. If it's just a matter of being a little patient and waiting fifteen more days-is only two weeks-then when you have strength, then we can all go on the <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> and you'll be able to hopefully gain more strength and finish up all of these works. But I think that the risk, in terms of the future of the whole world, is too great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> is not risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you went on this <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> the other day around the temple, you became dizzy just going around the temple four times. That's when you were even able to sit up in bed a lot more. How is it going to be possible to go for four, five or six hours, when you couldn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not four, five, six...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's how long it takes to go around Vṛndāvana by bullock cart. It takes three hours walking at a good pace, and it takes at least five or six hours, Lokanātha says, by bullock cart. How...? We couldn't even go a half hour just around this temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I traveled. It takes two hours in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But not by bullock cart. That's when a man walks very quickly you can do it in two hours, but by bullock cart it will take five hours. We have... You had difficulty even doing a half-hour <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> around this temple. You became very faint. Whether you think that you can go five hours in a row?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Mādhava Mahārāja's Maṭha, bring Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should bring Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī here? Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Indu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Indu-mati Prabhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indu-mati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Indu-mati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, you know Mādhava Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">mandira?</span> You know Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī, Prabhupāda's Godbrother? You know? So Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma will go with you. Prabhupāda wants to see Indu-mati and Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī. You bring them both. You go in one of the cars. Mādhava Mahārāja's Maṭha. Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma-not the Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī from Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Mādhava Mahārāja's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> As your humble disciples, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we are ready to take my instruction that you've kindly given us, but at the same time, you have advised us many times that we shouldn't take unnecessary risk. Just like few days ago you were telling a Bengali saying, saying that when you are doubtful, don't do it. You instructed us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, can you tell us why you want to go on the <span class="Italic">parikrama?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...good paddy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This seems like suicide, Śrīla Prabhupāda, this program. It seems to some of us like it's suicidal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is also suicidal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Prabhupāda said, "And this is also suicide." Now you have to choose which suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Rāvaṇa will kill and Rāma will kill. Better to be killed by Rāma. Eh? That Mārīca-if he does not go to mislead Sītā, he'll be killed by Rāvaṇa; and if he goes to be killed by Rāma, then it is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who is this Prabhupāda's talking about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Mārīca.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I mean, just judging the symptoms, which is all that we can do, certain symptoms have certainly picked up. For instance, you're passing more urine, stool is coming naturally, and you're able to drink milk without getting any cough. These things were never there before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if the treatment is continuing, if the treatment is working, why not continue it under the guidance of this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> for some time? His point is this. This is what I've seen, Śrīla Prabhupāda, being your secretary all these months, that whenever you took milk you would get cough. For the first time I see there's no cough coming. Another problem, you couldn't pass urine. Now there's double the amount of urine. Another thing, you couldn't pass stool. Now it comes normally. At least it comes without any artificial means. So the one thing that has not yet come is strength, and <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is suggesting what you yourself had always said, "If I can drink milk, I will get stronger." So if the <span class="Italic">kavirāja's</span> treatment... To my feeling it has worked. At least symptoms... The symptoms have been better under his treatment than any doctor so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It will work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Also Śrīla Prabhupāda's resting better than before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the idea is that... According to him... I mean, obviously we're all conditioned, and... I mean, he's not claiming not to be a conditioned soul either, but according to him, going on this bullock cart is a suicide. He said within an hour or two hours, the bouncing and jumbling of the bullock cart will cause a heart attack. Just like you were having heart..., a little heart spasm the other day, just laying in bed two days ago. He says this going in a bullock cart, up and down, within one, two hours it can cause heart attack. So as his treatment has been better at least than any other doctor, and certain symptoms have improved, why are we giving up his advice? If you say his advice is wrong, then there's no comment, but all along, his advice seems to have been more accurate than any other doctors that we've had. I mean we who are closely around you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, your servants, secretary, our opinion of him is far superior than our opinion of any of these others. I see that he's able to take care of one symptom after another somewhat successfully. He's able to deal with these problems. He can deal with the problem of not enough urine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He feels quite confident that you can live for six, seven more years, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We also feel very confident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Better that you live for six or seven years productively than that you go on this <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> and die within two hours gloriously. Why not live for six or seven years and then go on <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> and die? If the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> can always be done, why not put it off for six or seven more years of preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> You've already been glorious, Śrīla Prabhupāda, all over the world. Whether you're here or outside doesn't really matter. You're already glorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> By your presence countless souls will attain devotional service. That's more glorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I think I shall be cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda says he thinks he will be cured by the <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> (Bhakti-caru and Shastriji-Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Under the circumstances we have to consider whether Prabhupāda's opinion is more or less than the <span class="Italic">kavirāja's,</span> is what it comes down to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can't continue..., consider. Śrīla Prabhupāda has to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If Prabhupāda says that by going on <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> he feels he'll be cured, then how can we continue to place arguments against him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kuvera?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Shastriji is telling Prabhupāda to ask the Kuvera's <span class="Italic">puṣpaka-ratha.</span> That is airplane of Kuvera. And do the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> in that. Then there won't be any pumping in that way. And he's saying that if Prabhupāda asks for that, he will sure get it. (devotees chuckle)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ultimately what Prabhupāda decides, we will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, it just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, but it goes on. As Prabhupāda goes on, his disciples also go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Shastriji's saying, Mahārāja... Shastriji's saying that Prabhupāda shouldn't talk too much. It's bad for his heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we can have <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> until Kṛṣṇa dāsa comes. Okay. (<span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>) Lokanātha is here, over there, Śrīla...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? Where did you go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I went to Mathurā. I went first to Vṛndāvana and looked for the carts. They were not very good kind. They were made for rough loads. So I went to Mathurā and spoke to one farmer. He had a fairly big size cart and two strong bullocks, and he asked for a hundred rupees. He wouldn't come down. So ultimately I agreed for a hundred rupees. And he will reach tonight at eleven o'clock. I asked him to start immediately, but they have <span class="Italic">pūjā</span>-as we have <span class="Italic">go-pūjā,</span> they also have oxen <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> today-so he will only reach at eleven o'clock, and he will be with us all day long tomorrow. I had to give him one day or maximum...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Of what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many carts you have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I got just one today, one for you, and those who serve you, they could also sit besides you in the cart, and the rest could do <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> around the bullock cart, and the whole unit, bullock cart and <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> group, will move together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what we have to pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We'll pay hundred rupees, one day. Of course, you want to have it for all the time. Best thing is to purchase a set of bullocks, two bullocks, and a cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Well, depends on whether we like to use it for longer time. Then we should purchase. If it is just for a few days, best thing is to hire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundreds rupees and food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> No. He has his food for himself and bullocks. So that's for the cart, two bullocks and the driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes. This is what they earn for living. Usually they carry different loads from place to another place. Each trip they take twenty rupees, thirty rupees, fifty rupees, according to distance and the load they carry. But it's expensive to keep it for many days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If it is inconvenient, we may not keep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> If it is convenient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we shall keep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So we'll hire first and see how it goes, works. And if you think it is nice, or comfortable, all right with you, then we can purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how many we are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many will be going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, all the devotees want to go, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how many carts you require?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Just one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> One for now. We also had a meeting, and we were discussing that if we go around just in Vṛndāvana, all will go. But if we keep going from holy place to holy place, then we have to decide whether everyone goes or just a few of us go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are hiring for how many days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> This is only for one day it is hired now, but we could continue to hire the same cart for several more days by paying extra money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our experiment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It certainly is an experiment. Of course, we always like experiments to be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Where he'll go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Where will we go? We thought tomorrow to go around the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Does a cart go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I've never tried it with a cart. Smara-hari, you say a cart couldn't go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> No, he says it cannot go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Smara-hari, who is familiar with the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> path, says that a bullock cart would not be able to pass in many of the places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, then that means we can't do a Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smara-hari:</span> For example in Keśī-ghāṭa there's no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's experienced. He says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> This Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> is mainly for walking and circumambulating. It's not meant for going in a vehicle, motor vehicle or bullock cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Suppose we would go to Keśī-ghāṭa or one of the important temples like Govindajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Those are seven temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, another possibility is to go to the places where the main temples are, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the Gosvāmīs' temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Tomorrow is Govardhana-pūjā, and a procession through the city of Vṛndāvana would be very ecstatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> One parade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Others will come also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yeah, well, if we go through Vṛndāvana, probably many people will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Then we could also get some experience, because if we were, for example, to go to Govardhana, we would have to pass over similar roads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> This cart does not have cover, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This bullock cart which I hired has no cover on the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So we have to cover it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Lokanātha Swami, you apparently didn't get one question of Prabhupāda. He asked what do you think about this trip. You didn't answer that. You have some experience with bullock carts. What do you think? In this condition Śrīla Prabhupāda will withstand the trip? You know in what condition Prabhupāda is in now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bullock cart are usually very bumpy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This has rubber tires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> If these roads are not bad, and the cart has tire wheels...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So we're discussing bumping, so won't be much bumping on the cart. Also, we always could go slow. If Prabhupāda wants to make an experiment, we could make one day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A few hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am thinking I am lying here... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> ...should ride in very nice carts, a chariot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, (indistinct). (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I saw one in Maharastra. In Poona. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You can purchase immediately. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We'll have to design it. They're not ready-made like that. The kind which we want, the pull-on kind, with cover on top and nice arrangements, we have to design it and order it. Get it made. There's a place called Meerut, north of Delhi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I sent you. You have got already experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You said you want to make an experiment, so let us make an experiment with this hired bullock cart, and in few days' time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So where will we go tomorrow if we go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Govardhana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Govardhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> That's very far. We went on one parade three years ago in Vṛndāvana, with elephants, that Your Divine Grace went. Maybe we could go on that same route.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Govardhana will take about six hours to reach there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> No, how many kilometers is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, it's very far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twenty-eight to thirty kilometers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It takes one hour by car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Take five kilometers an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's six hours to get there. Six hours to get there, and then three hours around Govardhana. Nine hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And six hours back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> And the bulls might have to rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have to rest the bulls, don't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> There's one route we went on in Vṛndāvana, on a parade. Shorter route. First time, as an experiment, we could go a shorter distance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's quite a big experiment to make, going to Govardhana the first day, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You feel confident that you can travel nine hours in a row on a bullock cart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am sleeping here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> He says he's sleeping here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this is not a bullock cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> One thing is that in the Gosvāmī temples they have <span class="Italic">govardhana-śilā.</span> That's also Govardhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? The main concern of the devotees is that whether you will be able to survive such an experiment. But before, you said that you felt that such a <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> would actually cure you. You said that. So your vision is transcendental, because you are the spiritual master. You're a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So if you say that it will cure you and that it will be beneficial for you, then we have to carry out that..., whatever you desire. We do not know. We're just on the mundane platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One-day experiment. It is for one day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We have hired it for one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rest assured. I will not die in one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So we should go to Govardhana? Because tomorrow is Govardhana-pūjā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we shall make our cooking there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We should start early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got experience. Dig the ground and make our foodstuff. Very good picnic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good picnic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If we go to Govardhana, we would take the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> that was prepared here and bring it there, so that many people can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Or otherwise we can make real picnic. We could collect some grains there from door to door and cook some <span class="Italic">khicuṛi</span> there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> There are already many thousands and thousands of people there, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Perhaps it will take a long time to get there because of traffic. I was in Mathurā today. Every ten minutes buses and <span class="Italic">ṭāṅgās</span> and so many kinds of vehicles were going to Govardhana. There are many, many thousands of people there today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Besides that, the devotees would have to walk nine hours in the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Perhaps the road will be very busy tomorrow, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Can't walk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, let them take their time. They do that. It is very nice picnic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> From my village there is this pilgrimage called Pandarpur. This is sixty miles. And still, old men, they just travel, walk. Every <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> they go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Every <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> they go to Pandarpur, have <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of Charukmari(?), and return on foot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You have assured us that in one day you're not going to die, and you want to make this experiment, so we should do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We'll do it with great enthusiasm. Your Divine Grace is infallible. So if you say that it will help and cure you, then that must be a fact. You've never been wrong about anything, Prabhupāda, so you must be right this time also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us make experiment. Don't hesitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So we can fix up the cart tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Where's the cart? Outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> It's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> It will reach at eleven o'clock here. So I suggest right after <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati</span> we'll go, or we should start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far as possible, take me in a comfortable position. That's all. As far as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Comfortable position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Arrange one bed on the cart. This mattress can go in nice arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is not the best. There is other mattresses that are as good or better than this. The temple has many <span class="Italic">gadis.</span> We'll get them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> We can make nice arrangement. This will purify Govardhana Hill, Śrīla Prabhupāda. <span class="Italic">Tīrthas</span> become purified by the presence of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Another <span class="Italic">tīrtha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Yes. Prabhupāda will go to the <span class="Italic">tīrtha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> You're a Vaiṣṇava like Arjuna and Hanumān, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomorrow is a great festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Tomorrow is Govardhana-pūjā festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are in Vṛndāvana, and we shall not take part? We must take part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. We are in Vṛndāvana and we are not taking part. We must take part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So we should all go to Govardhana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Who is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About thirty or forty devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We're just like puppets, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We are all unfit to make any decision. Whatever Your Divine Grace instructs us to do, we just follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, Lokanātha, what do you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What do you say, Lokanātha Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We should make experiment to please you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> That will be ever-new experience for us also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It will be historic. Many people have been invited to the temple here. Many people have been invited to attend the function here at the <span class="Italic">mandira.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Thousands of people are expected to come tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> That can also go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they have invited?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> To Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "What time?" he's asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> At 11 a.m.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At around noontime, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a big feast at one o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So half of our men may come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Half of the men may come, and half should stay. All the Vṛndāvana devotees can stay. All the visiting devotees should go. All right, we'll make that division, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep that palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Keep the palanquin on the cart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where should we keep it? With us on the cart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Carry it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Bring it along.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> We'll bring it along. (discussion of how to do this)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So when we'll come back from Govardhana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tomorrow night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So after circumambulating Govardhana, we will return to Vṛndāvana or stay out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Maybe we could stay overnight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> When we are there, out, we'll decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He can't come back tomorrow night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's helpful for the devotees to know, just so they can bring something to wrap around when it gets to be nighttime. It's not the middle of the summer, you know. It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We have two, three vehicles here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm saying it's something that should be considered now, and not when we get there. You said when we get there we'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We should make all the plans complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you consider.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We should go with plans for staying overnight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are asking me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> I think we'll have to stay there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We definitely have to stay there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta: :</span>Six hours to go, three hours to go, that's nine. It's not possible to come back. So one night, spending one night in Govardhana.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> The devotees should be prepared to stay overnight there. Under the trees. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We're supposed to be<span class="Italic"> gosvāmīs. </span>We have to stay under a tree. Different tree every night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> When we were traveling from Vṛndāvana to Māyāpura we stayed many times. Outside we'd live under the tree. It's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, but if just one window is open at night, Prabhupāda starts feeling cold in spite of the blanket.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have experience. I have no experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Maybe you sent me to experience this bullock cart program so that you could...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I'll tell you, I'm getting so upset sitting in the room upstairs. I mean I just... I was walking around... Two of the devotees told me this road is so bad that if you go on this road, you're going to be jolted back and forth. The road is terrible. I just can't understand, Śrīla Prabhupāda, why it has to be tomorrow that we have to go. If anybody wants you to travel, I do. My whole desire is to take you all over the world. I want to take you on <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> but why do we have to go when you're in this condition? I can't understand it. It just... I was standing outside. This <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he has worked so hard. He's so much disappointed. He can't understand why he... He says that now, today, you've taken half a kilo of milk. No mucus has is being produced. No stool is being passed. He says tomorrow he wants to give you a medicine that will begin to build the milk into muscles. He's going to get you to a point where you can take two kilos of milk a day. And he says very soon you'll be able to have the strength to actually do <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> So why are we throwing everything out the window, that we must go tomorrow? I cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot refuse all your request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And we cannot refuse your request. We will take you all over <span class="Italic">tīrtha-yātrā,</span> to all the places. Just that you get a little stronger. You'll be free of all management. You simply go to <span class="Italic">tīrthas</span> and take <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of all the Deities in India. Everyone will stay in their respective places. They'll manage. But we just want you to be stronger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. That will satisfy you? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bābājī Mahārāja also, you also thought that? We did not talk to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We were just on our way down the stairs to come and see Your Divine Grace.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I cannot put you in anxiety. You have done so much. You have suffered in Māyāpura so much. I cannot put you in anxiety. So I shall do what you like. (Bengali) Lefthand, righthand. I cannot refuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean I'm amazed, Śrīla Prabhupāda. A half a kilo of milk you've drank today-no mucus, no stool, and that is wonderful. You could not have done this two weeks ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, when I told the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> he got quite amazed. He told me, "Don't give any more milk. It might..." But Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted some milk now, so I'll give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is <span class="Italic">kavirāja?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's out again getting medicine. This man, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Adri-dhāraṇa says he sits up all night worried about you, thinking, taxing his mind how to give you just what you require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yesterday, when I went to call him at 4:30, I saw him sitting on his bed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All night. He goes in the jungle four, five hours looking for roots, herbs to give you. He's so sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many well-wishers, I cannot refuse. This is not my business. (Bengali) All right. You take Bābājī Mahārāja. That will be my going. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the bullock cart will go tomorrow.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To Govardhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, other devotees can go. I cannot go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they'll go on your behalf, but you will go one day. That we promise you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Our greatest pleasure will be to take you on <span class="Italic">tīrtha-yātrā,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. We wanted so much to go with you on that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we're so much attached to you that you practically drive us to madness sometimes. Tonight we were becoming mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I shall not do that. Bābājī Mahārāja? (Bengali) So you will take bath in Rādhā-kuṇḍa on my behalf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll get you better, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and you will also be able to take bath personally there. We'll see you get better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa will make all of our words come true, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali-brings milk for Prabhupāda)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. (Bengali)</div>
