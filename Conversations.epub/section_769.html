<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll never give us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> They're willing to give; they just want a higher price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] He wants six thousand rupees. (Prabhupāda laughs) He has got three and a half <span class="Italic">bigas,</span> about twenty thousand rupees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't want it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This is about four feet. It used to be ten feet high. This used to be ten feet high. [break] ...the top during the monsoon. But according to the Ganges level the water is going up and down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what is the depth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> It's about twelve feet now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. [break] This is not our land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This sugarcane is our land, but this is not our land. That's why here the top became narrow. [break] ...here the one step with the pathway coming up to here and one step over there. [break] ...know this height was all right because you requested to lower the height. Then we'll put a stairs going up and over there. Over by these steps, then going up and over the hill, there will be a stairway. So then we can make a nice sitting platform with a shade area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He wants to know if this height is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This height?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This height as compared to the ground and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> And we'll landscape on this now, planting trees and things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how this side? You can make it also slope. [break] ...clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, perfectly clear. [break] ...cannot bathe. We'll have to make more. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This land will be utilized for walking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We're going to put trees and things and make it beautiful. At one time you suggested that there be cottages placed here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Trees are very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> So we'll make this a park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Those trees which can grow on low land, they can be put here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...for trees, do it very nice, different types of fruits and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] ...suggested that for this year's <span class="Italic">Ḍola Pūrṇimā</span> we put hutments here for the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Just temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Grass, for housing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are so many rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> There's not.... Rooms only can hold about three hundred devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I thought there are already people living in the rooms, Jayapatāka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Some of the rooms are occupied for handloom, have big looms in them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not have rooms that side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda wants rooms there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, you've been saying this a number of times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That side. [break] ...unnecessary expenditure to have some cottage and again spoil it. Don't spend. It is better spend for rooms like that, that side, wall and rooms, and this should be used for only trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Walkway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes. Within the trees, walkway. That will be very nice. Don't spend unnecessarily for cottage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> For this year there is no time to make those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then as much as possible you can do. What is there? Engage hundred workers and it will be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we don't have the money to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will give you money. If money is the only question, I will give you money. You can immediately begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We will immediately start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, cottage.... But make it little higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. If it floods.... There should be a plinth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plinth should be higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> See, right now there's no bricks available in the market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Because they just started producing bricks in January, December 15th, and all the government has advance bricks. We wanted bricks.... Right now it's very little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many brick fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> But they've just started production.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just inquire. If it is available you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, inquire Jayapatāka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I'll inquire. Because we just ordered four thousand bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We ordered four thousand bricks. It took two weeks to get them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but now it's later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can make a big tent here, big tent. So people may come: women tent and men tent. There is no need of rooms. That will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where? Right up here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, on this land. Just like here you can have a big tent, there a big tent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> For the devotees to stay in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woman tent and men tent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We have enough rooms for the women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We're going to make a women's tent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You can have a tent. If there is extra men they can live in this tent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Supposing there are bricks available, should they try to build?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes, immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We can start, but I'm doubtful whether we'll get enough bricks to finished. That's only my point, if I start and don't finish it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there's no harm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no harm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda said let's do what we can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Begin.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> All the dollmakers have gone to Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. All right. [break] ...bricks are available you can begin immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can make tent here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, this is better place than up there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can make tent here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We put much dirt here. This land is a bit raised now. We can just open them out here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Anywhere you can.... Here, you can make tent here, here. Just near the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Some <span class="Italic">sabjis</span> are growing there. We can make some place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This place is already open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...and people can live there. [break] ...very nice, facing east. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] ...are the handlooms. The dispensary is here. Then here men are living. Then, from this side over, the women are living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's ni...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Separate. Then the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> pavilion and kitchen are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...dispensary I can give you some formulas for general diseases. One has got little fever; you give that <span class="Italic">mista.</span> One has got some sores; you give some ointment, without any doctor's advice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We need, Śrīla Prabhupāda. For all those little things we need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I will give you so many formulas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> For boil also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything, all common disease. You have got cough? Take this <span class="Italic">mista.</span> Just first of all find out what are the general complaints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> For several.... For some time practically no one has been bed case, but little things, cuts, bruise, cough, cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Many formulas I can give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> There is one woman from England. She is in charge of our dispensary. I can send her by today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> You can give her the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...mixture. Stock medicine that is called. [break] ...consulting doctor, without any harm, you can give. Just like homeopathic. So now these are vacant. Why these doors are not closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This one is utilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This is our spinning room, workroom. They just left it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are hand loom departments, the whole.... How many rooms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Five rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Five or six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Nine rooms? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...that's nice. Very good. [break] ...surprised that "In temple, why handloom? What kind of temple it is?" They will criticize like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll.... They get one point: "Oh, here is some fault." And then, "They're not worshiping? They are going handloom?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Here is the moon. There is one dark spot."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the rascals do not know Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">svakarmana tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ.</span> Whatever he knows, he can work on it, and that way he can get perfection, provided he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is wanted. Otherwise people think, misunderstand, that "They are parasites." Why we should be parasite? We should work for Kṛṣṇa. That's all. It is not that because <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> you'll be able. No. Everyone. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā:</span> "Whatever talent you have got, you can serve Me and be perfect." That is the program. They are preparing cloth for the devotees, not for business. Therefore he is serving Kṛṣṇa. To serve devotee and to serve Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference. [break] So proper watering is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Actually these places are very far from water. We have to put some other line to make it very efficient. Now they're just taking by bucket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can join some pipeline. Make a water storge, and from pipeline it will be supplied everywhere. Make water storage on the roof, on the roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We have.... On that corner room there in the kitchen, that's one water storage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> That supplies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So by pump store water and by pipe distribute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This is what the Gargamuni's money, as we get, we're using for these programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is being broken again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why are these rooms being broken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This is.... We're putting on the other side the doorway. You commented that "Why the door should be facing inside?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No inside store.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> It's facing outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> It's already finished. We're just going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, these are stores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Bookstore and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. We're going to make a small entrance door on this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cloth store?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Cloth and bookstore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Many people request that we sell our cloth because they say they don't get such nice cloth in the market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, bookstore, <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> store and this.... Yes. <span class="Italic">Prasāda.</span> Make five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Right now we have four stores, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We have four fronts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On that side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> There are books, cloth, <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And.... Books, <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and cloth. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span>? Why not appoint one <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> maker? He can sell outside, and whatever he makes we shall take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we need them for America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One utensils, <span class="Italic">karatāla</span> seller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I can.... We can have our own people. Just as the store owners are making outside, we can make outside with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why outside? We shall make here. Simply you require the manufacturer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can manufacture brass items?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> To make <span class="Italic">karatālas...</span> To make <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas</span> doesn't require much capital, but to make <span class="Italic">karatālas</span> requires a lot of capital because the metal is very expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall invest. If we get good manufacturer, we shall invest. What is the capital wanted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> About four, five thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, we shall invest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> The <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> is living on this side. And they're having classes in this original house. [break] (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bidi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Many people want to open up a shop. They'll pay for the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">tulasī...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Our land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not employ one man to manfacture <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> beads? Yes. There are many experts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have to live here as devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, let them manufacture. That will make him devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> On the right here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is our nursery for our landscaping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is nice. It is very.... It will be very nice to live in these rooms. What is the cost of this <span class="Italic">kattan</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do we pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Bed, the small bed, about twenty-five, thirty rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> And the bigger ones, a full man size, about forty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. It is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> That's solid wood with <span class="Italic">mingo(?)</span> top or <span class="Italic">turta(?)</span> top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> [break] ...stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many boys to stay in one room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Two boys to three boys, depending on their size. Little ones, three and four, and the bigger boys, ten, twelve years old, two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> These are the remnants of old dioramas that we had.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you have broken them?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there are so many rooms. You could not make any store?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> First they were in the building to here. When they moved it then many became damaged. And somebody came in and vandaled them.</div>

Gopāla Kṛṣṇa said that Ramesvara was going to send the funds. We have enough money to start a few arches as long as his funds come soon. But if he delays with the funds, then it will be difficult because we don't have very much money now.</div>
