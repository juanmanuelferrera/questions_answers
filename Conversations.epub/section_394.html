<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the first qualification is <span class="Italic">anasūyave.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Anasūyave,</span> one who is not cajoling against God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. One who is not envious. A person generally... All conditioned souls, they are envious of God, envious. "Why He should be God? I am God. I am God." So Arjuna is not like that person. Therefore he is speaking to Arjuna. He is devotee. In the Fourth Chapter also, He said <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si priyo 'si</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa does not expose Himself unless one is devotee. This is first qualification. So to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> one must be a devotee. The so-called <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> yogis, they cannot understand. It is not possible, because they are trying to become God. Although it is simply dream, they can never become, but they are envious, that "Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? I have got so many gods." <span class="Italic">Anasūyave.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa avagamaṁ dharmyam.</span> If you are <span class="Italic">jñānī, karmi,</span> yogi, you cannot immediately directly perceive whether actually you have got the thing, but <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is like that. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga,</span> if you perform, you will perceive that "Yes, I am in this stage. I am in this stage." That has been described by Rūpa Gosvāmī. Just like when you are hungry and you are eating something, you can understand... (aside:) Don't come very near. You can understand that how much satisfaction you have got by eating. You haven't got to ask anybody, "Whether I am eating?" You can understand. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is so nice thing that if you execute it, you will understand your position. And it is <span class="Italic">su-sukham.</span> To execute <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> there is no difficulty. It is always happy. Just like our program. Program is chant, dance, take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And if you take yoga system, <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> system, first of all you have to become a very great learned scholar, and then yoga system, you have to practice so many <span class="Italic">āsanas,</span> press your nose, and so many things. But here everything is very happy: chant, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> dance and then take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and you understand where you are. This is the <span class="Italic">su-sukham.</span> And <span class="Italic">avyayam. Avyayam</span> means whatever little <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> you have advanced, that is permanent.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is His inconceivable potency. Everything is resting on Him. Without Him, there is nothing. Nothing can exist. Still... The same argument comes again, that because the dog or the anything is resting on me, it does not mean I am dog. <span class="Italic">Daridra,</span> he is resting on me, that does not mean I am <span class="Italic">daridra.</span> Yes.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Therefore, <span class="Italic">na ca mat-sthāni:</span> "Although I am there, I am not there." That is inconceivable, simultaneously not also, just to warn these people that although Nārāyaṇa is within the <span class="Italic">daridra</span> or the dog, that does not mean I am dog or I am <span class="Italic">daridra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like this cloud. The cloud we say, "In the sky." The cloud is not in the sky. It is on the air. They mistake this, that "Nārāyaṇa is there." Nārāyaṇa is not there. Nārāyaṇa is separate. That is their foolishness.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And again there is <span class="Italic">kalpa.</span> Again they come out. In this way they do not become liberated. Just like the child, those who are being, what is called, contraceptive method, abortion. These are very sinful. Because they have done killing, so they enter into the mother's womb and they are again killed, and again enter into the mother's womb, and again killed. He does not see the light. Similarly, those who are sinful, they are given chance in material manifestation, "Now work for Kṛṣṇa consciousness." But they do not do that. Again enters, again come out. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is going on.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may be whatever it may be. Now, just see that how much country conscious he was. He wants prophylactic brush. Not only that. I will tell you another incident. I was manufacturing one medicine, jagon(?) poultice. That is like anti-(?). So doctors were prescribing in Allahabad. So there was one big doctor, Dr. R.N. Banerjee Rai Baba. So sometimes I was seeing the doctors. So when I went there, "Oh, it is very difficult to prescribe country medicine." "Why?" "Oh, you will be surprised. I prescribed this jagon poultice in the Nehru family." He was physician. "And Motilal Nehru said, 'Oh, doctor, excuse me. In the matter of medicine, you don't prescribe country medicine.' " Just see. Believed in him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gandhiji was never asking anything, for medicine much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is another thing. I know these people, this Nehru family. They were completely Europeanized. Outwardly for them... Even up to the last point of his life, if some European would come, he would immediately receive him. And if an Indian wants to see him, "Oh, it will be..." You will have to wait at least one. Everything London-made is very good. That was Jawaharlal Nehru's idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> That was absolutely opposing the Sardar Patel. Anything he wrote to another white skin, "All right, let him be." Lenin, we see, after all. Lenin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also not good. But these people, they are <span class="Italic">svadeśi,</span> for country, but I know them very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, he was right up to the end very conscious about this. Because of his Oxfordian education. I think he was in eternal hell, one of these things.(?) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> England. He was educated in England, but who can become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Absolutely. It was a miracle, the greatest miracle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was... From very beginning of his birth, he is Englishman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was not allowed to speak Bengali by his parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Because in those days... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are forgetting Sanskrit very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, those who are interested...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now the schools, they don't teach as in our times. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> were negligent, immediately the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> should take step. That was the system. [break] ...offer advice to the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> according to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> and <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> would execute, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> would care for supply. And the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> serving everyone. That's all. This is the system. [break] So he used to manufacture. To manufacture means <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> (end)</div>
