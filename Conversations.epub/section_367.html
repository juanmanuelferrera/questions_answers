<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also very good, good in this sense that they do not eat without restriction. There is some restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That if you want to eat meat and chicken, then you first of all sacrifice before that deity. So at least they'll be restricted from eating meat purchased from slaughterhouse. But this rascal civilization, one side they're advertising "Stop cruelty to animals," another side they're opening unrestricted slaughterhouse. Just see. One side they're allowing marriage of woman every week, another side contraceptive. Just see their contradiction. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...there is animal sacrifice in the church. Is there any such pre...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jews, they have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That was one of the things that Jesus was against.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shocked. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That the Jews were sacrificing animals in the temple. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Excuse me. (Microphone ruffles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't come very near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> I'm sorry. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. People will know our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your Guru Mahārāja was also very outspoken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Oh yes. (pause) [break] ...that demonstration, "Ouḥ! Ouḥ!" They do not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. Only two men are coming. Two only coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two of them do it here, but I think the big group does it on Chowpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Chowpati Way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because they live in Woodlands, Warden Road. So they go to Chowpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They also own flat, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, they are not staying in that same flat where they stayed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They have their own apartment. They heard, and they have seen workers. They are barking... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...big animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't think he would say that so you could... Must have just joking. He's religious, highly religious man. Yogendra Bhai is the most highly religious man in the whole group. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean he actually said that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not actually, he's... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is no question of action. It will also act, how much we are religious, only God knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...there is there. <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva sanmukharitāṁ bhavadīya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Up to now, I think this is the best part I have run across. One of the best parts. And that, that particular <span class="Italic">līlā</span> of Kṛṣṇa is the most thrilling one. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And when Brahmā saw Kṛṣṇa with four... and Viṣṇu with four hands and all, all, even in cows and boys, the calves and everything, then it was the height of the whole philosophy. You have read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But you must have read it in English, in those two volumes of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I read it in Sanskrit, in directly. And there, in real, original Sanskrit it is wonderful. You get the real <span class="Italic">rasa</span> of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you, do you mean to say that I was reading it indirectly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. Indirectly. It is indirect. The real Sanskrit is different. He will tell you. Any other language than Sanskrit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, there is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...will not get that <span class="Italic">rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> O <span class="Italic">rasa. Rasa nei hai </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, <span class="Italic">rasa...</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Real <span class="Italic">rasa</span> comes in Sanskrit. I read it twice in Gujarati, but I, I was not able to get that pleasure when I read it in Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha-pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.</span> (S.B. 7.9.10)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those two books of Kṛṣṇa, you have written, it's from this only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Tenth <span class="Italic">skandha,</span> no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, I read all those books which you have published. Now more books, you must send because I am a voracious reader. I'll finish all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutāt.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> having twelve brahminical qualifications... <span class="Italic">Viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha-pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> well-learned, well-scholar, and just brahminical principles, strictly following, but if he is not a devotee, from him, one <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> is better. <span class="Italic">Śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.</span> Why? Now, because that <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> has<span class="Italic">-caṇḍāla</span> who is devotee <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla,</span> not ordinary <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla-</span>he has dedicated his mind, his body, his activities for the service of the Lord. Therefore he not only is purified, but he purifies the whole family, whereas a qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> if he is not a devotee, he cannot purify himself, what to speak of purifying the family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the <span class="Italic">śruti</span> also they mention that all those yogis and philosophers and, and other developed spiritually, if they have not, they have not been able to really realize what Kṛṣṇa or God is unless they have become <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span> But in this only it comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In this particular part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I thought <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> was a book of stories, so I was not reading. I am so truthful to you. That is, I read all, I myself, more than half a dozen times all the, mean, twelve <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span>. But I said, <span class="Italic">"Bhāgavata</span> why?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I read it in Gujarati...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> in the beginning it is said, <span class="Italic">nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam [SB 1.1.3].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That first <span class="Italic">śloka</span> you explained to me. First <span class="Italic">śloka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> First.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya ya... [SB 1.1.1].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ah! <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya.</span> It becomes very difficult for me to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not difficult. No. Because the question... It is the explanation of <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra.</span> So the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra,</span> the beginning is <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> "What about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth?" The next verse is, immediately, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> "The Supreme Absolute Truth is that..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "...from which everything is born."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...everything is born." Now that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> begins the answer: <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> From the second line of the <span class="Italic">sūtras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Answer <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra's</span> question. The answer is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata: janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Then what is that <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ?</span> And he says, Vyāsadeva says, <span class="Italic">anvayāt itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ.</span> That... The... <span class="Italic">Abhijñaḥ.</span> That the Absolute Truth, from whom everything has emanated, He knows everything directly and indirectly. He knows. Because He's <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is knowing everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Knowing every... Knows everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Knowing everything. Knowing everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhijñaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All-down-knowing, all-down-knowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So He's not a stone. Just like some philosopher says there was a chunk and creation came from that. So here <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, "No. The origin of creation, He's a person<span class="Italic">-abhijñaḥ.</span> And He knows everything, directly and indirectly." Directly, I know this is my body, but indirectly, I do not know what is going on in this body. Therefore we go to physician that: "Please tell me what is the ailments in my body." So I do not know what is the cause. But the original Absolute Truth, He knows everything, directly and indirectly. Therefore He is <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ. Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayāt itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> In this way, concludes: <span class="Italic">satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhīmahi.</span> Yes. Krishna Shankara Shastri has written hundred pages on this and explained it. And I got lost in it, on this one single <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> He has, about the last <span class="Italic">dhīmahi,</span> is also a part of <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī-mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What this <span class="Italic">kuhakam, kuhakam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuhakam</span> means this material world is <span class="Italic">kuhakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuhakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">kuhakam</span> means illusion, magic. Something magician showing. So much money. Just like your this, one <span class="Italic">bābā,</span> what is...? Satya...? He creates some gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Satya Sai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) A magician in Gujarat, some Muslim magician. He would ask, not ask for a (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> He would not...? He would not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (3):</span> Mama Chel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mama Chel. There was one man called Mama Chel. And when the ticket taker comes and asks for a ticket he would say, "All right, take this," and there would be a heap of tickets, railway tickets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So a magician can do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A magician he was. He would stop that train. Stand behind and stop the train. Stop. He must, people must have got some <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, the yogic <span class="Italic">siddhi, aṣṭa-siddhi, aṇimā-laghimā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but that, this <span class="Italic">aṇimā-laghimā,</span> you get, the <span class="Italic">sāttvika</span> fellows. But these, these people who are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Anyone can get. It is a practice mechanical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But wrong, wrong...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mechanical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So the <span class="Italic">vartas</span> (?) also get it, these <span class="Italic">śakti-vartas.</span> They get this by tantric yoga. I can't still understand how <span class="Italic">tantras,</span> by following, I mean, drawing particular figures and writing down those figures, you can get powers. This is very common in Bengal side, this <span class="Italic">tantra.</span> No? I read a book on <span class="Italic">tantra</span> by Sir Arthur Avalon, and he described so wonderful powers come by this and that. I don't know whether it is a fact or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is materialism. Anyone who is after powers, that is materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I could not believe in it. How could it come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this is also <span class="Italic">tantra.</span> Just like nowadays, they were flying sputnik, and from here controlling everything. Millions and millions of miles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But there is a science behind it, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is also a kind of science, subtle science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This writing, writing letters, two and two, and, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are subtle sciences. These are gross sciences. There are subtle science also. Just like now mechanically you are flying. But there is science... Anything. I can fly with this stick. That is possible. <span class="Italic">Ākāśa-patana.</span> There is a science, <span class="Italic">ākāśa-patana. Kapota-vāyu. Kapota-vāyu.</span> Now, you can train the pigeons, and it will, you'll fly in the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāyu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And a carpet also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You must have read the carpet-flying in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I used to read such stories...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, the aeroplanes mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> they are not machine. <span class="Italic">Mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because this <span class="Italic">puṣpa-vimāna,</span> it could land anywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Puṣpa-vimāna</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The <span class="Italic">puṣpa-vimāna</span> was with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...flying in <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not, it was not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now scientific improvement has been done, but that is on the gross material platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Spiritually, they must be worthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not spiritual. That is also subtle. Just like mind, the speed of mind. The mind is material. By mind speed, you can... Just imagine. You are here. Immediately, within a second, you go to Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because you think of the thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> First going is mind going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the mind. Similarly, mental, then intellectual,... You are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. You are going ahead. We have to come to that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Mind is also material. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ kham. khaṁ manaḥ [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Khaṁ manaḥ eva ca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are all material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But... But even in, even in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The so-called <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they are on the mental platform. Therefore, they are also materialists. Therefore Brahmā... You'll find in that <span class="Italic">Brahma-stotra, jñāne prayāsam udapāsya:</span> "Give up this attempt to reach the Supreme by mental speculation." <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam uda..., namanta eva:</span> "Be submissive." <span class="Italic">Namanta eva sanmukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām:</span> "Just hear from devotee the news of the message of God, Kṛṣṇa." That is the process recommended. <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva sanmukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām. Sthāne sthitāḥ.</span> You haven't got to change your place. <span class="Italic">Śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> You hear from the realized soul and try to apply in your practical life. Then, one day, although God is unconquerable, He will be conquered by you. This is recommendation by Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I heard sometimes in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> that you have to become pure, you have got to leave your body consciousness and become soul conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is soul consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the other conscious, and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body consciousness is mental speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I say. You must go beyond that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. This is the gross body and subtle body. So when these <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they think that they have become liberated, but they are entrapped by the subtle body. <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These yogis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are also, the same thing: gross material thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The yoga means to join yourself. Your self means not body, not even mind, but your soul, to the higher soul of, that means the God. That is real yoga. And that is as good as <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Or you call it yoga, anything. Yoga and <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> comes to same thing then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is real yoga.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, within yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarve...</span> So within yourself, if one thinks, <span class="Italic">antara mad-gatena,</span> Kṛṣṇa, always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, that is first-class yogi. But the so-called yogis, they want to become Kṛṣṇa. "Now I have become God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But then I don't think they say they are becoming Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Their disciples say. As any disciple...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have not, if I have not taken you as a as a god, then I can get my knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If I take you as a man, I have not got it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing! If God produces rascals, then he's a rascal!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The guru has got to be taken as God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another... Guru has taken... Not that God, he's God only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Guru is not talk, God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's... just like your representative. Suppose if I have got you some business. There is a call: "If you love me, you love my dog." It is not the dog is you. Dog is different. But if you love somebody, you pat sometimes, "Oh,...," the dog. Just to satisfy him. <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> This is stated. If you satisfy guru, then God is satisfied. That does not mean guru is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, no! I don't say I think guru...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't understand and you also don't understand me. I mean to say that disciples have got to take guru as God, and not this body as God. His <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is guru, and <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is God. So guru in that way is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And I don't think I am wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why God...? Why do you make...? Why do you distinguish between guru's <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> and guru's body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the body... But the body's not guru!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Māyāvāda. That is Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even if you say guru is body,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They make also Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's inside different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa's body is different from your body and my body. Kṛṣṇa body is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you make a... Once you say that guru is equal to Kṛṣṇa, and again Kṛṣṇa's body and Kṛṣṇa is not different, but guru's body and guru's soul is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That's not right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> is, <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is guru...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not right. Please note it. If you compare the guru is God, then you should compare similarity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Similarity, this body and Kṛṣṇa's body are different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, no. That is an ignorance. You do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa's body is spiritual. His, any part of His body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Māyāvādīs do that, that Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He can hear, He can hear by His eye and hear by His finger. And satisfy anybody, by His anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That is all right. I mean to say that <span class="Italic">sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ **.</span> When you accept guru equal to Kṛṣṇa, then you cannot make such distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bodily distinction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why bodily or anything!?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the... No, no, no. They cannot make, say distinc...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The body, this body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cinmaya...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body, that... If...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that, Kṛṣṇa's body is not that body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only, not only guru. Anyone who is spiritually advanced, he has no more material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's... From higher stand point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if you, if the guru is in the lower standard, then how he becomes guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, that guru who knows that he has no real material body, he's beyond the body consciousness, that is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no! Even the material body's there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Guru thinks so, but what about this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even the material body is there, still he's to be taken as spiritual. That is the philosophy. The example is given: just like you have got an iron stick. You put it in the fire, and it becomes warm. And when it is red-hot, it is no more iron stick. It is fire. Do you accept this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Similarly, one who is always merged in Kṛṣṇa thought, his body is not material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That way you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes! Yes, that is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because his material body is not working. That is stopped. He's working simply spiritually. Therefore his body is spiritual. The same example: it has become so hot, red-hot, that it is no more working as iron rod. It is working as fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because it burns anybody who touches it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So guru also does the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He electrifies anybody who touches him. So we touch your feet. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, therefore he has no material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is <span class="Italic">aparādha. Guruṣu nara-matiḥ.</span> This is forbidden. <span class="Italic">Guruṣu nara-matiḥ. Arcye śilā-dhīr...</span> Just like everyone knows... The atheist class will say, "Oh, here is a stone statue, and these rascals are worshiping as Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone knows that is a stone statue. But we are so fool that we are worshiping a stone statue? Therefore this is offense. <span class="Italic">Arcye śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara...</span> Similarly guru. Although he's working, moving just like ordinary human being, one should not consider that he's ordinary human being. <span class="Italic">Guruṣu nara-matiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is how the guru can be accepted by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone knows that "Here is a stone statue." Then so many hundred and thousands of people are coming to worship that stone statue? Somebody can argue. The atheist will argue. And when... So... We have got millions of temples. Especially in South India and Jagannātha Purī and many where. So are they going, spending so much money to worship a statue? That is forbidden. <span class="Italic">Guruṣu nara-matiḥ.</span> Guru should not be considered in that way. If he's actually guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Guru, guru's <span class="Italic">śakti</span> on his disciples comes from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...either way. Where the <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> draws his power and guru gives it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but if he has no power, how he can give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But... That is what I say. So we have to take guru as God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore guru as God, not distinction that guru is so much God, and he is so much God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't say distinction. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you said that distinction of body, distinction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I did not say that. You have to understood it differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I am not. It is the guru principle we are talking. That is about guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I want to learn from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not guru. I am... I am... This is... The guru has no material body. Just like the statue is not material, similarly, guru's body is not material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You say that those gurus who appear as material body, you are not to take it as a material body. Say that way. Because we are little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Not to take it. It is actually. If it is material body, then how they are getting benefits? If it is a material body. The same example: if it is iron rod, how it is burning? It is fire. When there is burning, you must assume it is fire. Why do you take, "Oh, it is iron rod"? <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate. Phalena paricīyate.</span> By the result you have to... Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> We, we have no direct contact with Bhagavān, but guru, being representative of Bhagavān, if we satisfy guru, then Bhagavān becomes... Identical. Therefore it is warned: <span class="Italic">vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</span> Similarly, <span class="Italic">vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</span> "Here is a European Vaiṣṇava, he's Indian Vaiṣṇava, it is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa </span>Vaiṣṇava and <span class="Italic">śūdra </span>Vaiṣṇava." No. That is also, that is also offense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is wrong. Vaiṣṇava is Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, to consider guru's body as material, that is also wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I read somewhere that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...you have got to take guru as God from this point of view,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...that he's <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> You are worshiping God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Whatever <span class="Italic">vāda</span> it is, I mean, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Māyāvāda says, "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is God within you." The Dr. Radhakrishnan said, the rascal. "Kṛṣṇa is within. The outside is material body." You have read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is no within and without... I have not read that. There is no within and without so far God is concerned. God is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And similarly, similarly, guru also-no within, no without. Otherwise how we can say, <span class="Italic">sākṣād-dharitvena.</span> Directly, if you make distinction, how he can be directly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Within, without is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.</span> But he has attained that position on account of his being very, very dear to God. Because doing God's work. Eh? God says, "Surrender unto Me." Guru is preaching... That is real guru. He's preaching, "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." He'll never say, "Surrender unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No guru says so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All rascals says. All rascals say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But rascals are not gurus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The gurus, so-called gurus, there are. These Māyāvādīs, all they say. "I am God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Let me now have <span class="Italic">rāsa</span> dance. Send your children. Send your wife, send your daughter. We'll dance."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have got some discrimination! Our is only point: If anybody is a Māyāvādī, he's a dog. Kick him on his face!! That's all.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What do you mean by Māyāvāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāvādī means who thinks like that...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ..."Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is different from His body." That is Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is no body of Kṛṣṇa. Whole thing is body.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Māyāvādī. They think that Kṛṣṇa comes with a "<span class="Italic">māyā</span> body." Therefore they are Māyāvādīs.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? And he became God. By worshiping Kālī. Just see how much Māyāvādī he is.
