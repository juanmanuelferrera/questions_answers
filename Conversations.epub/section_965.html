<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 19, 1976, New York</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only our men, outsiders also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many outsiders were doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They like to pull the ropes. It's a big experience for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (belches loudly) What is this gas, oxygen? No. They put some gas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Carbon dioxide. CO2. You should have seen it. It was literally completely filled. We put on a play. First we did a big <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> after you left, very big, and many, at least a thousand to two thousand people were dancing. Then there was a play, and the people crowded to see that play of Kali, Sudāmā. Oh, they were amazed to see. Sudāmā was moving around, dancing, watching. They like that very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sudāmā plays nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's expert. Especially at that part, Kali and Sin. (laughter) And then after that I looked out at the crowd and literally I could not see any open space in the park. Really, I was shocked. Even where there was a fountain, the whole fountain was filled with people; even where there was water, they were standing in the water, there were so many people. It was hot, so they were standing. And the beautiful thing is because there was a fountain, the air was blowing the water all the way to the stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were preaching all this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Preaching and <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja chanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh, yes, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, this festival was wonderful. So many people took <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and afterwards they had a play and then they had, they did some <span class="Italic">bhajanas,</span> and the people were enchanted by the whole thing. And the neighbors there, they said that "In the five years I've lived by the park, the park has never been so nice." It was just wonderful. They say about seven thousand people took <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> See, seven thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was a line all the way around the park. They couldn't serve it out fast enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seven thousand took <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>! That was the free <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And another seven thousand we sold <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They had big queues for buying watermelon. Bali-mardana had bought lots of watermelon, and they were selling slices for fifty cents each.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Lassi</span> also, and lemonade, very tasty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were also selling <span class="Italic">lassi</span> and lemonade. It was very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Burfi</span> and <span class="Italic">lugloos,</span> sweets, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bali-mardana's wife, Taittirīya devī, she was in charge of the sweet table. So she had about four or five sweets, they were all the same, but she made them somehow look different. So everyone was saying, "Oh, which one is which?" And she would say "Each one is different. You have to take one of every one." But they were all the same. So people had to buy two and three kinds. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is good saleswoman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She is very good. And Tripurāri, I watched him in action. One person came up and said "I want a <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> 2.2." So he looked and said "We have 2.1.," and he said "I want 2." So he said "This is very close. 2.1 and 2.2 are very close to each other, and it's all absolute." In this way he made the man take one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, actually that is a fact. There is no difference, 2.2 and 1.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> And then we had a life membership table with Gajahanta and Śravaṇānanda. The Indians were all coming, and there were chairs for them to sit down, and they were preaching to them life membership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And they had..., you know that little portable movie screen, you may have seen, it comes in an attache case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like Gargamuni's, he showed you in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we had three of these set up, and many people were sitting in chairs watching the different movies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It was amazing that one little generator was supplying all the power. This one little gasoline generator was supplying the power for all the sound and the various electricity things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, there was no electrical hook-up; we did that with a gas generator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And there was no sound, <span class="Italic">cutcutcutcutcut.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, because we put it very far away. In India that would be a nuisance, the sound of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is Ambarīṣa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was not in the parade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He is going back to..., I spoke to him for a little while. He's going back to Boston right after the parade, I think, with Aja? I spoke to him; he seemed to be a nice boy. I asked him, because we were meeting with reporters. So they like to ask who is giving you big donations. I wasn't sure whether he wanted his name to be used or not, but he said, "Oh, yes, you can use it without any question. I do not mind at all." (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, go take rest, you have worked so hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we didn't. (end)</div>
