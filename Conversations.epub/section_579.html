<div class="Heading">Radio Interview<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>May 25, 1975, Fiji</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The following is an interview which took place on May 25, 1975, in Lautoka, Fiji, which was later broadcast on a local radio station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Why did you choose to go to America and propagate the teachings of Lord Kṛṣṇa in a western country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Indian people, being subjugated for at least one thousand years, they have lost their original culture. And, being poverty-stricken, they are simply after money, by hook and crook. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayā apahṛta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 2.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Persons who have lost their consciousness on account of being too much attached to material enjoyment, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So I thought that America, they have enjoyed enough of this material happiness, money and women, and they are now becoming disappointed. So they are at least on the platform of renunciation. They don't want any more like their fathers and grandfathers. Of course, they are not guided. Therefore I preferred to go there to guide them. So almost fifty percent of my devotees are, they are collected from these disappointed persons, young men. They are going astray. So they appreciate that I have saved them. Therefore they are after me, this younger generation, and they are helping me in broadcasting this Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So I think my attempt was successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> These Oriental philosophies generally and in particular the Kṛṣṇa consciousness has found a lot of devotees in the western civilization. What is the main reason for this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are thinking this is Oriental civilization, but that is not the fact. The fact is this is human civilization. There is no question of east and west. Every living being, not only human being, even other beings-there are 8,400,000's forms of life-and Kṛṣṇa claims that</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir<br class="calibre2"/>haṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So Kṛṣṇa is for the aquatics, the animals in the water. The vast sea, there are so many animals. Then, from the water, the trees are coming out. <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.</span> In this way evolutionary process is going on. But all of them, living entities, and part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa. So by the evolutionary process they come to the human form of life. Now there is developed consciousness. Now, the human being has to decide which way he has to go, again to the lower species of life or higher forms of life. The higher forms of life are there in the upper planetary system.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Their duration of life, material standard of living, very, very comfortable, thousand times better than here. So Kṛṣṇa says that if you like to go to the higher planetary system, you can go there. That it is said, <span class="Italic">yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25].</span> If you cultivate yourself for going to the higher planetary system... But first of all we have to understand that we are eternal, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. We are simply changing body. This is material condition. Either lower grade of bodies or higher grade of bodies, but we have to change. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Just like we are changing our bodies from childhood to babyhood, babyhood to boyhood, boyhood to youthhood, then old age, similarly, when this body will be finished, no more usable, then we'll have to accept another body. But we... The present civilization is so foolish they do not know-even big, big professor; I have talked-that there is life after death. They do not know, although it is very evident. That they have no such knowledge, even common sense.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">And they are big, big educationist. Anyway, there is no such department which deals with the transmigration of the soul. That is the defect of the modern civilization. So there is transmigration of the soul. By evolution, by transmigration of the soul, we have come to this human form of life. Now here we have to decide again. Because we are part and parcel of God, a small particle of the same quality... So God is fully independent. We have got also a little independence. So God does not interfere with our independence. Now here we have to decide which way again we shall go. We have come by the evolution, by nature's way. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> Nature has brought us and given us a chance, whether we shall go to our original spiritual life or we shall remain in this material world by changing body one after another. That is to be decided. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is educating people that "Stop your so-called material advancement. You come again, back to home, back to Godhead."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Therefore our paper's name is <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> Don't make any false advancement. You will never be happy. This is our propaganda. It is called <span class="Italic">nivṛtti-mārga. Nivṛtti-mārga</span> means stop material way of life; begin spiritual way of life and come to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, back to home, back to Godhead. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you cultivate spiritual life, then, after giving up this body... We have to give up. This is material body. And after giving up this body, we can accept..., we can continue our spiritual body or we can accept again material body. That will require our sense how to cultivate. So if we cultivate spiritual life, some percentage, not that everyone will be able, at least the higher class, higher section of the society, if they cultivate spiritual life and remain ideal, so others may follow. This is our propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Coming back to this question of the western type of civilization, do you feel that the success of the movement in the western society is an indication of the need being felt by the western man that has been lacking in spiritual ideologies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. But the thing is that they are very intelligent. There is no doubt about it. Materially, they are always advanced. Materially, when they are manufacturing machine of the airship, in India we are manufacturing sewing machine or cycle. I have seen in the World Fair the Indians were very proud of manufacturing cycle and sewing machine, whereas the Americans and Europeans, they were showing the how subtle machine of this jet plane are there. So materially, they are advanced. There is no doubt about it. Hundred years. But spiritually they are not. Therefore, I am an Indian, poor Indian-they are coming to me. Because they understand that spiritually... Not only me, any swami who go, they crowd to him, "If there is something spiritual?" Unfortunately, the other swamis, they go to exploit them, to cheat them. They do not... Neither they do know what is spiritual life; neither they could give them. For example, for the last two..., hundred years or more than that the swamis are going; not a single person was a Kṛṣṇa devotee in the history in the western countries.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">But now we are putting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Hundreds and thousands are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Swamiji, it's been said sometimes that India has too much philosophy and the west has too much materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Where is the right balance in this modern world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Balance is that you should be reciprocal exchange. What you haven't got, you give me; what I haven't got, I give you. This should be the process of exchange. Then the world will be united. When there is exchange of gifts. But our India followed the principle for begging. "Give me men. Give me money. Give me wheat. Give me rice. Give me war materials." Simply begging. So we must give something. This is the first time we are giving something. Otherwise, India was a beggar simply to the western countries. For their technical education they are going to the western countries, and when there is war, they are asking America, "Please give us war materials." And when they give war materials to Pakistan we become envious. But you are also taking rice, <span class="Italic">ḍāl</span> for this(?). So why should you remain beggar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Finally Swamiji, what is the relevance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in our modern society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> What would be the relevance of Kṛṣṇa's teaching in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Relevance mean you are spirit soul. You are not this body. This thing first you have to understand. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> That is India's philosophy, that "I am spirit soul." And if you realize <span class="Italic">brahmāsmi, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na... [Bg. </span>18.54]. As soon as you realize that you are not this material body, you are spirit soul, then immediately you become jolly, <span class="Italic">prasannātmā. Prasannātmā</span> means <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> He has no more any hankering for things which he does not possess, no more any lamenting which he has lost. Take, for example, that we have lost our portion of country as Pakistan and fighting since... This was a plan by the British government that divide them in such a way. They will perpetually fight. They will never be happy. This was their plan. That has been successful. But we are lamenting. Both... Pakistan is lamenting or not, I do not know, but Hindustan is lamenting. Gandhi was against this partition. But Jawaharlal Nehru, just to become prime minister, immediately divided.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So these things are going on. So lamenting, we have lost our... But if you take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement very seriously, you can make the whole world Hindustan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
