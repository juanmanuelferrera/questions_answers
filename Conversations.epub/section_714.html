<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.</span> By pleasing the spiritual master, you please Kṛṣṇa. That's nice. But why Kṛṣṇa should be pleased? Why? What is the necessity of pleasing Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> To please the representative of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is all right. Guru is representative of Kṛṣṇa, but why one should bother himself for pleasing Kṛṣṇa? Answer this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> 'Cause our real position is to serve Kṛṣṇa, and because we've fallen in this illusion of the material energy, so we forgot our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall do it otherwise. Why shall I please Kṛṣṇa? We are making scientific progress. What is the use of bringing God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Because we shall never become perfect or see the answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is begging the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> For spreading the name of the Kṛṣṇa, in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is not the question of guru. Guru is doing all right. Why you should be so much anxious and feel obligation to please Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (4):</span> Everybody has to serve somebody, so Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure and everything exists from Him. So instead of serving anybody, we should serve the Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "That's all right. Without serving Kṛṣṇa, I am getting pleasure by drinking wine. Why shall I...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> That pleasure will not last. That pleasure is only temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "No, I will not also last. (laughter) that..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But to accept such a mentality, we say that is third class. Actually our life is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your statement, "third class," but my statement is "It is first class." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is it first class if every time you are going to eat something nice I was standing over you with a stick, and as soon as you took, I would beat you? So every time you have some enjoyment, there is some concurrent suffering. Like you enjoy the wine, but then you have a headache, hangover. You enjoy. Then you get sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the Tenth Chapter, He says, "For those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I will give the understanding by which they can come to Me." So this is our desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I don't want to go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> You don't want to go to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Yes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> All right, suffer. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I don't suffer. (laughter) I am enjoying."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You are enjoying death and old age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Yes, you are putting upon me some impression, 'suffering,' but I am enjoying."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Your knee is hurt. Is that enjoying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "That I am curing. That is also nice." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But soon the whole thing will be finished. You will not... No one enjoys death. No one will take voluntarily a death pill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody of you could answer the question. Now I give you again chance to answer this question very properly. Why one should be obliged to please Kṛṣṇa? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Just like this finger. Its position is to serve the body. Just like the stomach. Everyone may be jealous of the stomach and not want to feed the stomach, but if all the hands and the legs and the mouth went on strike not to feed the stomach...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the right answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...they would ultimately be destroyed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is right answer, that you cannot non-cooperate with the stomach. You must serve the stomach. Otherwise your position is very precarious. That is the answer. If the finger thinks that "I shall remain independent and be happy," that is not possible. The stomach must be supplied food, and then all the parts of the body, they'll be happy. That is the point. So you cannot non-cooperate with the stomach. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is the central enjoyer. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">. </span>He is the center. Just like ordinarily this African state, if you do not satisfy the state or the president, then you cannot remain happy. Independently you cannot be happy. We require in every step sta... We have come to this park because state is cooperating. In the morning we shall come, and they have prepared it nicely. We are not going to the jungle. So if we actually want happiness we must cooperate with the state. This is crude example. Similarly, if our ultimate aim is to become happy, then we must cooperate with Kṛṣṇa. This is obligatory. You cannot escape it. Then you'll be unhappy. This is the... Stomach. <span class="Italic">Pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam.</span> Therefore the natural process is you pick up... A child even. He picks up some something, but he does not put anywhere-immediately in the mouth. Why he does not bring it in the ear? Why? The child immediately takes it. He does not know what is what. But the nature is that as soon as he captures something, even he does not know... Because his position is eating, he knows this much, sense gratification. Other senses are not yet developed. So the child, he knows taste with tongue and eats. That he knows. So immediately anything he captures, he brings to the mouth, naturally. He hasn't got to be educated. So our position is like that. We being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, our natural tendency is to serve Kṛṣṇa. Natural tendency. It is not artificial. When you forget Kṛṣṇa, that is artificial. So our normal life means to love Kṛṣṇa, to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is our normal life. Without serving Kṛṣṇa our life is abnormal, madman's life. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says... When you forget Kṛṣṇa, He comes to preach the normal life. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is normal life. So Kṛṣṇa does not require your help. He can create many helpers. But for your good Kṛṣṇa comes, that "If you want normal, happy life, then surrender unto Me." This is the proposal. Therefore the whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> all Vedic knowledge, is there. We have forgotten our position. Our posit..., normal position, is to love and serve Kṛṣṇa. Therefore <span class="Italic">anādi bahir mukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela ataeva kṛṣṇa veda purāṇa karila.</span> Because we do not know... From time immemorial we cannot ascertain when this incidents have happened, to forget Kṛṣṇa, but it is practically... Life after life, life after life, we are changing body, but forgetting Kṛṣṇa. So here, in the human form of life, there is the opportunity to revive our original position, and we require the help of knowledge, perfect knowledge. And that is there in the <span class="Italic">Vedas. Atha eva kṛṣṇa veda purāṇa karila.</span> If we don't take advantage, although we have got... We can read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and if we don't take advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and go on whimsically, then we'll suffer. You cannot non-cooperate with Kṛṣṇa as you cannot non-cooperate with the stomach. This is the... You must. There is no question of alternative. You may, may not know. It is not. You must. This is the position. Otherwise you'll never be happy. And happiness is your aim of life. <span class="Italic">Atyantika-duḥkha-nivṛttiḥ.</span> We are... I'm suffering from this knee's trouble because I am in this material world. I have got this material body. So <span class="Italic">atyantika-duḥkha-nivṛttiḥ</span> means no more material world, no more material body. And for that purpose we have to cooperate with Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise it is not possible. Any question about this? Just like these African women. They are going to work. There is no question of no work. They must. Otherwise they cannot eat. Anyone, if by working his livelihood is going on, how he can non-cooperate? This is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The thief is also eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's grace, just like the government gives the prisoners also to eat. But they are condemned. And government's grace that government provides all necessities. If a prisoner is sick, he is given the hospital facility. But he is restricted free movement, that much. Otherwise government gives the same facilities within the prison house and without the... The standard may be little different. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ (yo) vidadhāti kamān.</span> He satis... Why this human being prisoner? Even He is giving food to the animals, to the birds, beasts, everyone. Noncooperation cannot be. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bijo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">. </span>Now, you have to grow trees, plants and vegetables for your eating. So that you cannot have without cooperation with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa gives all the seeds. <span class="Italic">Bijo 'ham.</span> You cannot manufacture the seed. He gives the seed. You work little, sow it and get the result. But without cooperation with Kṛṣṇa, how can you get the seed? Then where is your food? No food. You must take... "God, give us our daily bread." Kṛṣṇa gives the seeds, and you sow it and get the fruit or grains. Then you can exist. Even if you are animal-eater, the animal must also come from Kṛṣṇa. You cannot manufacture the animal. That is also coming from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bijo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> The animal is produced by father and mother, but the seed is given in the semina by Kṛṣṇa. And then animal is produced. So how you can non-cooperate Kṛṣṇa? You have to cooperate. Otherwise... (man yelling in background) What is that? (laughter) Huh? They are criticizing us? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's imitating the birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughter) Just like this tendency was exhibited by Kṛṣṇa. In the forest the two brothers and other cowherds boys, they were also imitating. They were flying. The bird is flying; they were also flying like this. And coming to the monkey, coming to the peacock and imitating the..., like this. These are description in the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But his imitating the bird means he will become a bird?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This man's imitating the bird means that he will become a bird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necess... This is sporting. It will be decided what he is thinking at the time of death. That will become prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Is it by chance what you think of at the time of death or is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...it dependent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is dependent. Just like all of a sudden some idea come to us. That means we had contact with such idea. It is compared with... Just like there is a big pond. All of a sudden, you see, from within a bubble comes "phut!" There is no reason, but it comes. That means the thing is there within the pond, the situation. All of a sudden, without any time, it comes. They put this chance theory like this. But this is not chance. If... Because we are changing our life, so everything is recorded in the mind, dictaphone. So sometimes some idea which I had contact with many, many years ago, it comes. It comes. It is not chance. I had contact with such thing. All of a sudden, that idea comes. We shall go now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...I am in the car, they offer me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Oh, all African, small boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They understand this is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I understand Kṛṣṇa is the Personality of Godhead, and He is the one who create this material world. So my impression is Kṛṣṇa, He didn't make this material world to be spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is spiritual as soon as you become a devotee, spiritual. We are living in the spiritual world. That I explained last night. So ultimately there is nothing material. Material means when you forget Kṛṣṇa. That is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> My question, Prabhupāda, was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no material. When you forget Kṛṣṇa, that is material. Just like madness. Madness is not our natural position, but when your brain is deranged, then it is madness. Madness has no separate existence, but when our brain is not in order, there is madness. Similarly, there is nothing material, because everything has come from Kṛṣṇa. The original source is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> So the material world, the so-called material world, has come from Kṛṣṇa. So if it has come from Kṛṣṇa how it is material? The cause and effect is the same, maybe differently manifested. Just like cotton, cotton made into thread, the shape has changed, but it is cotton. And from the cotton thread, you make cloth. The cloth is cotton. But if I say, "Cotton. Bring cotton," then you'll bring cotton, not this cloth. But the cloth is also cotton. Now understand? Cloth is nothing but cotton. But when I say "Bring cotton," you'll not bring a cloth. You'll bring cotton. So the Kṛṣṇa is the <span class="Italic">sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> cause of all effects. So all the effects are Kṛṣṇa. But you have no such realization. When you understand that this place is Kṛṣṇa's place, so you can worship Kṛṣṇa, glorify Kṛṣṇa. But if you don't realize that it is Kṛṣṇa's, then you talk nonsense, madman. "This is American property," "It is African property," "It is this. It is that," so many madness. But the <span class="Italic">śāstra </span>says, <span class="Italic">iśavāsyam idam,</span> everything Kṛṣṇa's. And the materialists, they'll pro... "No. Why everything? It is my country. It is my place." That is material. Similarly, anything coming from Kṛṣṇa-Kṛṣṇa is supreme spirit-it is spiritual. The devotees, they understand that "This fruit has come from Kṛṣṇa. The flower has come from Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it must be offered to Kṛṣṇa. It is for use." Otherwise how the fruit becomes spiritual? We take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> How it becomes..., the same fruit? No. Because the Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there, it is spiritual. It is spiritual, but it was not known. When one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he understands that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Hari-sambhandhi vastūnaḥ.</span> Everything has got relationship with Kṛṣṇa. That's the fact. So if anything has got relationship with Kṛṣṇa, so that is not material. We are going to a house, but it is said "temple." Why? Because there is relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise where is the difference between the next house and our house? So Kṛṣṇa consciousness means that everything is spiritual, but we do not accept it. We accepted something else. That is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> From all scriptures you instructed us in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that we should not jump from book to book, but I am so much attached to them that I read every book. Would that stop me to understand the philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By reading, you'll understand. Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's asking that it states in part one of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that one should not jump to the Tenth Canto without having read all the previous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes. Knowledge has got step. You are learning ABCD. How you can go to higher studies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But the <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> is feeling that he likes to read all of your books and sometimes he reads one book and sometimes another book. Is that bad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not bad, but better go by step by step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol. </span>(end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> City Hall is also there. United Nations has offices in that big building. They study the environment. It's environmental study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another scheme. For the last thirty, forty years they could not study. "In future, we shall be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Monday, president, he was addressing that Kaiser(?) affair in the next park. So there was even one helicopter. So they came to throw off flowers on him in the gathering. But suddenly the helicopter fell down there on the train. There was train was going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, it was a jet plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana(?):</span> It was a jet. Yes, one of the jets fell down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They had the air force here. They have four jet planes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Fighter jets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Fighter jets, four of them only. And during the national celebration they fly in procession. So one of them fell down, killing the pilots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> These are very old jets that were supplied by the British. (Prabhupāda laughs) They're so proud of their four airplanes. Now they only have three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Could not replace the other one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I don't know if they've replaced it or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> That's the British scheme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They give them these things to "civilize" them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chanting <span class="Italic">japa-</span>break) Nice. [break] You have meeting in this park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Just on the other side of the road, the city park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We used to come here on Sunday with that truck and have meetings in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Prabhupāda came here.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break]...the name of this park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It means freedom. When they were able to obtain their freedom from the British rule they made this park and they called it Uhuru Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they got freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They had to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes, they had to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Regular violence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Oh, yes. Very violent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They would go into the farm... The Europeans owned all the farms. And they would go in vans with these knives and just cut everyone in the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They cut everyone up into small chunks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They cut them into pieces.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Into small pieces.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And it just happened recently, one political opposition leader, he was brought to some place near Nairobi and he was... His genitals were cut off, his eyes were...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> This park? The British. They designed all these parks and roads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I know that other park-yesterday or the other day we went-that was done by the British. They've taken plants from all over East Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All these buildings are constructed by the Britishers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Some Indian organizations, firms, come also. Big construction companies from India, they are combined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Usually, in all of the business concerns here, the top man is British, managing their activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when they kill such brutally in the farm, the Britisher did not take any step?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Not very effective steps. They declared a state of emergency, and they brought soldiers here, and they had huge arrests. They had camps just outside of Nairobi, and they were arresting tens of thousands, huge camps. But the tactics that they would use, the Africans, the British soldiers couldn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They brought British soldiers or Indian soldiers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> British soldiers, so long, how they'll come? They were using Indian soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> I know that Indian peoples, they helped them to get this freedom. That is the reason they have a little bit respect for the Indians now, this president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How Indian people helped them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They would give their... These groups of guerillas, the Indians would supply them and use their facilities and their farm houses. And then also, legally, the Indians were able to give, from their experience in India. They were able to make some government, some kind of a freedom government system. They agitated to get representation in the Parliament, and they became... When independence came there were many Indians as M.P.'s here. And even when Kenyatta was put on trial by the British, his chief lawyer was a Britisher, but the second lawyer was an Indian. Also the union movement was... One Indian, he helped organize the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> I was talking with a judge. He is a Sikh gentleman here. So he told me that "In the freedom we all helped, and I was not a judge at that time. I was ordinary advocate. So I play a nice role to get them freedom, so they appointed me a judge after that." Now he is judge since last fifteen years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Is that Makhajee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Indians had the experience of the independence in India to draw on for inspiration and also for their strategies and so on, to guide the Africans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now they are trying to drive away Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Now they have brought a income tax official all from India here. So the Indian people, they were giving their money to the African and taking money to London and U.K., here and there. So now they have brought out from India. They are very strict. People still take money, but they have more to take than the African. The African people are very poor, and they were giving them so much money and taking money out of it. It is difficult for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These people can be brought under control by bribing. There is no problem. They have no moral strength, and poor. They will accept bribe. I think by bribing it is still going on. Otherwise how they can stop this bribing? That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> No. This is their major problem, the immigration authorities. Once the people come here and start to make their exploitation, they cannot get them out. So they make all kinds of artificial regulations. You have to have so much money. You have to have this, and that, your ticket, so many things, to try to stop people from coming here, because once they're here, they just pay their way, and then they get anything they want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The simple method that everything belongs to God... The king is the representative of God, and he distributes the land amongst the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span>. Just like knighthood or in Mussulman times, <span class="Italic">subedat(?),</span> and in Hindu times, the subordinate king. Just like Pāṇḍavas, they were the emperors, and under them there were many hundreds and thousands of kings, states. And everything belongs to God. So why fighting? Take it. It is God's property. We are all sons of God. But there is no culture, Aryan culture. They do not know how to live peacefully and cultivate spiritual culture. They do not know. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśāya ye bahir-artha</span>...<span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.5.31]. And <span class="Italic">durāśāya,</span> bad hopes or hopes against hope, they're trying to be happy,<span class="Italic"> bahir-artha</span>, by the external energy, material, most fallen ideas, all foolish theories without any knowledge. Material, that's all. <span class="Italic">Bahir artha,</span> external energy. Otherwise there is no cause of anxiety or distress. There is enough land. They can produce enough food and live peacefully. They are talking of peace, but they do not know how peace can be achieved. They are hankering after peace, but they do not know how to achieve peace. And that formula is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> Accept God as the proprietor; then there will be peace. Something stolen from the proprietor by some thieves, and when they sit down to take their shares, there will be fight. The property is stolen, and they are sharing. Now, one will say, "Oh, I have worked so hard. You are giving me so little share?" And others will say, "No, no, we have worked equally." Somebody, "No..." In this way there will be fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This is going on in the United Nations now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will go because they are all thieves. When the stolen property is to be divided, there will be fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Like a band of pirates. They always fight amongst themselves and kill each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural. When they plunder, they are united, and when they share, there will be fight. This is psychology. When plundering others' property they will unite and take the whole thing, and then, when they come for sharing, there will be fight. This is the psychology everywhere. Therefore there are so many parties. Just like in India the... Of course, Congress Party was the predominant to fight with the Britishers. And as soon as they got independence, so many hundred thousand parties grew up: the Congress Party, the RSS party, the Hindu-mazara(?) party, the Muslim League party, this party, this party. And then they began to fight. This is the way. <span class="Italic">Senayor eva sa ucyate.</span> All these thieves and rascal, rogues... God's property, why you should fight amongst themselves? Property belongs to somebody else. Insanity. Just like this is government park. Anyone can come in. Everyone can equally enjoy. So why not make the whole world as Kṛṣṇa's park? What is the difficulty? Actually it is the fact. Why do you claim? Now we have come. If you say, "No, this portion belongs to us," and another, "This portion belongs to us," then there will be fight. And if we are Kṛṣṇa conscious, every one of us, that if they see Kṛṣṇa's property, so let us enjoy. What is the cause of fighting? The hotels are the centers for all kinds of sinful activity. Huh? Illicit sex, drinking, gambling and meat-eating. No discrimination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Near our temple there's a big... It's called the International Casino, and they advertise in the newspaper, and they have little drawings of people engaged in gambling, meat-eating, show girls and intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Alcohol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the only means of material enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> This means they're constantly in fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They must be fearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bodily conception life means misery and fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In Mauritius one of our life members, he's a contractor. He's constructing a hotel that has four floors. On one floor is the gambling casino, one floor is the restaurant, one floor is the cabaret, and one floor is the, also rooms for the women to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally people are not very much interested in our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Because these four things that they are supporting, we are against.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> I asked that pilot who was staying in our Bombay, Juhu land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Ha ha. Mr. Sharma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Not Sharma. That pilot. He's a pilot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, Ācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Ācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> He was staying in the International Hotel, so I asked him, "Why don't you come and stay with us? Stay there and attend the <span class="Italic">Ārati</span> and take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span>" but he refused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But he visited the temple here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> He visited. He said, "No, hotel is good."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Once they are accustomed to take these four things, especially meat-eating and drinking, it is not possible to give it up. Very difficult. Without drinking wine or without eating meat, they do not feel refreshed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They're in such anxiety all throughout the day that at night they cannot sleep unless they have a woman and some meat and some wine. Their minds cannot rest unless they take that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When we shall go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Shall we go now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am asking when we shall go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> At the temple, the Deities are open at seven o'clock. It's now twenty minutes after seven, so they're having <span class="Italic">ārati</span> now. <span class="Italic">Ārati</span> will be finished in just ten minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can go. (end)</div>
