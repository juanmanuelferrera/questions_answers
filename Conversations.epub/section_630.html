<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Fine thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I have several questions that I would like to raise. I have a long-standing interest in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> In <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And this I know is very important to you and to the Caitanya tradition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen all the parts published? Books and... Which Canto you have read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I'm not thinking so much of the specific Cantos as the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> as a whole. Is that, for you, as you see it, more important than <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the preliminary study of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would see the two related to each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If one can understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> then he becomes a bona fide student of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in the... You have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Oh yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> last instruction is <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> [Bg. 18.66] "You give up all kinds of occupation and just surrender unto Me." If one can take it very seriously, understand, then he can enter into the study of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> begins from the point where Kṛṣṇa left <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So he advised that "You surrender to Me," and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> begins, <span class="Italic">satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi [SB </span>1.1.1<span class="Italic">],</span> "I am worshiping the Supreme Truth." And next verse is <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">,</span> "All cheating type of religious system is rejected." So this is rather revolting. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Give up all kinds of religious system, just surrender to Me." And from that point <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> begins, "All cheating type of religious system is rejected." It is meant for the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa. Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ.</span> Those who are envious, for them is not <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> So any materialistic person, he is envious. It is not meant for the materialistic person. Those who are spiritually advanced, one who has understood that "I am not this body, I am spirit soul, my direct connection is with God, therefore my only business is to serve God." One who has come to this conclusion, he is called <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa. Haṁsa</span> means swan. A swan, it has got a quality that if you give the swan to drink milk mixed with water, she will drink the milk and reject the water. She has got the capacity. So <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> means one who has taken the essence of the existence, Absolute Truth, he is called <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would see the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> then as accessible to a wide range of people, at an elementary level or beginning level, whereas <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> would be for more advanced, more advanced people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only advanced, completely advanced. Because so long one will be, stay on the material platform, he will be envious of others only, animal propensity, dog. Dog does not like another dog is coming. So unless one is spiritually realized, the dog mentality will remain there. It is said <span class="Italic">nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam,</span> even amongst the topmost thinkers, if he does not refute other thinkers, he is not a good thinker. That enviousness. He will not be established a good thinker if he cannot... If a scientist, if he cannot refute the previous scientist, he is not a scientist. This is material world. Everyone is envious of the other. So <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> meant for who is no more envious. Simply loving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Why, why is that more necessary for <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> than for <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More... <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> I told you, it is a counterpart. Just like when you have passed the school examination then next you admit yourself for degree or graduate degree. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is the end of education. Everyone is progressing. When one comes to <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and understands it then his education is complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Then would it be, would it be dangerous for someone who is not at that level to study <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> or would they simply not understand it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dangerous means if one is not completely educated of self-realization he has the risk of degradation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> He has what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The risk of degradation. Now I have got human form of body, I may degrade to animal. Because transmigration of the soul. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara prāptir,</span> after death one gets another body. Now, what kind of body, that depends on his work. <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ [Bg. </span>14.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> If he has done very nicely, in goodness, then he will be promoted to the higher planetary system. And if he has not done anything nice then he will remain here or he will be degraded to the lower planetary system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> That is... How does that relate to the question of studying the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> if one realizes properly then he gets promotion back to home, back to Godhead. He is no more a person to live in this material world. Material world means ups and down, ups and down. And spiritual world means steady life of knowledge and bliss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But if one were to study, read <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> who was not ready for this, not prepared for it, this might throw them into confusion then, or this would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Would it be bad for them or would they simply not learn from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, as I told you the... Our only business is to know the Absolute Truth. If you do not try for this then you remain animals. Animal cannot know the Absolute Truth. So to remain animal means varieties of life. Sometimes cat, sometimes dog, sometimes demigod, sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes American, sometimes something else. This will go on. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this life we are living, we are making the next body. So if we work nicely then next body may be the higher planetary system or above this material world, in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And the way to progress then is to take, to study, to learn these things in order, in the proper order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I remember when I first, when I first met Brahmānanda in New York. I came there initially in part to, because I had been studying <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> and I wanted to talk to people in the temple about <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And they said, "What is this?" (laughs) "We've heard Swamiji speak of this but we don't know it." A few years later you were all sitting around reciting verses from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Was this... You did not begin to teach <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> when you first came to the U.S.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I taught <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> first of all, then <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you prepared, you prepared them with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and then <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen yesterday's procession?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I didn't get to the one yesterday, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, unless we have prepared groundwork, it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> A related question, which is a practical question also. I am collecting material for a kind of sourcebook, readings in Hinduism, contemporary as well as classical, and would like to include in these readings some of the things that you have written. Of the things that you have written what do you consider most important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Premā pumārtho mahān:</span> The most important thing is how to love God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And where of the things that you have written would that come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Where in the... In the things that you've written, where would that message come through most clearly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Vedānta philosophy, the most important philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's asking which one of your books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Which of your books do you consider to be the most important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, beginning from the First Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> It is step by step. First of all <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> study nicely so we can get the idea of Absolute Truth, and then by studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> you understand more and more, more and more, more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But is there, is there any one, one of the translations or one of the purports or of a series of purports of the things that you've published that you think is more clear, more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> we are describing word to word. So every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> you will find new idea, new idea. There are 18,000 verses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> (laughs) I would react the same way if anyone asked me a question like that. But you've... In the beginning of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> you did discuss the general story(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, you have not seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Yes, I've seen it. I'm just wondering what your judgment is on what... If you had to say to someone who was going to collect one small section of your work, what would you want them to collect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in few verses, you find out this. <span class="Italic">Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.9]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In the First Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya nārtho 'rthāyopakalpate.</span> The first thing is that people become religious. Just like in your Christian religion they go to the church to get some material profit. "Oh God, give us our daily bread." This is material profit. Similarly, Hindus or Muslims, they become religious, <span class="Italic">dharma artha kāma mokṣa [SB 4.8.41, Cc. Ādi 1.90],</span> the material activities. Those who are actually advanced... Those who are not even human beings, their philosophy is different. Those who are human beings, their <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> religion. Then <span class="Italic">artha,</span> economic development, and then <span class="Italic">kāma,</span> sense gratification, and then <span class="Italic">mokṣa,</span> liberation. These four things are taken as general activities. So <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says your <span class="Italic">dharma...</span> Religious principle means the ultimate goal is how to become liberated, not <span class="Italic">artha. Artha</span> means economic development. So then question may be if you do not, if we are not economically developed then how we shall live? The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says that you can make economic development as far as it maintains your body and soul together. Not that making whole life economic development and real purpose of life forget. This is foolishness. So <span class="Italic">dharma, artha. Dharma</span> means, religious advancement means how to get out of this material condition. Not that I go to temple and chant, "God, give me millions of dollars, and this, and that." This is not possible. It is good that one has gone to God to ask some help, that much credit is there. You have found out the verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya.</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dharmasya hy āpavargyasya<br class="calibre2"/>nārtho 'rthāyopakalpate<br class="calibre2"/>nārthasya dharmaikāntasya<br class="calibre2"/>kāmo lābhāya hi smṛtaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.9]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain. Furthermore, one who is engaged in the ultimate occupational service should never use material gain to cultivate sense gratification."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="calibre8"><div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We have already discussed that pure devotional service to the Lord is automatically followed by perfect knowledge and detachment from material existence. But there are others who consider that all kinds of different occupational engagements, including those of religion, are meant for material gain. The general tendency of any ordinary man in any part of the world is to gain some material profit in exchange for religious or any other occupational service. Even in the Vedic literatures, for all sorts of religious performances an allurement of material gain is offered, and most people are attracted by such allurements or blessings of religiosity. Why are such so-called men of religion allured by material gain? Because material gain can enable one to fulfill desires, which in turn satisfy sense gratification. This cycle of occupational engagements includes so-called religiosity followed by material gain and material gain followed by fulfillment of desires. Sense gratification is the general way for all sorts of fully occupied men. But in the statement of Sūta Gosvāmī, as per the verdict of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> this is nullified by the present <span class="Italic">śloka.</span></div>
</div><div class="Normal-Level">One should not engage himself in any sort of occupational service for material gain only. Nor should material gain be utilized for sense gratification. How material gain should be utilized is described as follows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People are after material gain. They have no spiritual information even, what is spirit, what is the need of spiritual realization, they do not know. Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍhas:</span> fools and rascals. Those who are after material way of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Do you... Do you think then that that, that message is the most important message that you have to convey?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the most important message. Because you are not this material body. Suppose you have got this shirt. If you simply try to maintain this shirt, is that very good intelligence, without taking care of your person? Similarly, if we are spirit soul and the body is just like dress, so the whole material world is, everyone is engaged to take care of the body. Nobody knows what is spirit soul, what is this need. Nobody knows. All these educational institutions, they are blind. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> And the whole system is also blind. If a blind man leads another blind man what is the benefit? No benefit. Therefore in your country, every country, it is a blind education. No spiritual enlightenment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What is the solution? What is the solution? Devotion to God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you know what is spirit. Then as soon as you know that you are spirit then wherefrom the spirit comes, or wherefrom everything comes? Then it comes to the question of God. And then we understand what is our relationship with God. And then if we act according to that, then it is perfect life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that you would... You would see the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> then as a guide to understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> It starts in Chapter Two with the question of what is <span class="Italic">ātmā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Chapter Two it is said... Arjuna was lamenting that "I shall fight and the other party they are my brother, so I will be sinful. So many problems will come." He was thinking like that. So Kṛṣṇa first gave him lesson that "Why you are thinking on the bodily concept of life? You are not body. You are spirit soul." Then He gave spiritual education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you must start with what the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> calls <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga</span> then, but go on, and go on to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> is said last. <span class="Italic">Sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> People are not prepared to take the sublime lesson immediately. Then he has to go step by step. So that is the system of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Are there other ways besides Kṛṣṇa consciousness to reach that same goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Or is that the only goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is only. That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bhaktyā mām abhi...</span> If you want to know God and your relationship with God then only through bhakti, no other. That is stated in the... <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> Otherwise you will never be able to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> If the highest reality is Puruṣottama and Puruṣottama is manifested in many different ways in the world, can people come to Puruṣottama through various paths?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Various path means <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the only path. Now all other paths they must come to <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Without <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> there is no possibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But must <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> be directed to Kṛṣṇa only or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Kṛṣṇa is Bhagavān. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means our transaction with Bhagavān. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> So original Bhagavān is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What about those who would worship Rāma, say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāma is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Rāma is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Another form of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Rāmādi mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan [Bs. </span>5.39]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What about those who would worship Śiva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śiva is just like milk and yogurt. The yogurt is milk but it is not milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> In another form then. So, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will not derive the benefit of milk from yogurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But do you get benefits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Benefit there must.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Benefits there are but not the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Lord Śiva means you get material opulence but not salvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would see Śiva as more related to material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> There is a passage in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> I forget where, where Viṣṇu is asked "Why is it that the followers of the ascetic Śiva are all wealthy and prosperous people and the followers of You who are the Lord of the universe are all poor?" Is that the way you would see it then, that those that follow Śiva are after more material gain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More material gain means you become more implicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> More what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Implicated. Our problem is birth and death, old age and disease. [break] ...this birth, death, old age and disease. For them, liberation, the ultimate liberation is to transfer oneself to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you see... You see a clear difference there between those who follow the Vaiṣṇava tradition, which is less worldly, more spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the ultimate goal of life. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: na te viduḥ svārtha gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> People do not know what is his self-interest. The self-interest is to approach Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What about Christian, Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What about Christians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christian also, that is nice, giving instruction to go back to God. It is not? What is the ultimate goal of Christianity? What do they desire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Hard to answer. There's no clear single goal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the goal, single or plural, doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Well, some Christians would say the vision of God, the ultimate goal is to be with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is really, to realize God. Not only Christian, any religion. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> There may be different types of religious systems but that system is first class which directly leads one to understand what is God and how to love Him. That's all. That is perfect religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So the question... The question in one sense is not whether it's Christian or Śaivite or Vaiṣṇavite but whether it is directed to a knowledge of God, a devotion to God or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But you would feel that there, what, it is easier to reach that goal by worshiping Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But is it easier or better to be a devotee of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> A Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> than to be a Christian, say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anything genuine is easy. Anything hodgepodge, that is not good. We don't recommend hodgepodge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So the advantage then, or the greater value is that it is focused and clear rather than a hodgepodge where the goal and the activities are not clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The hodgepodge has killed the whole world, that so many pseudo-religious systems. People are misled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So the truth may be there somewhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Truth is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But you can't find it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like there is butter in the milk but the milk is not butter. You churn it and then the butter will be there. Similarly, in every religious system... Every milk there is butter, but churning the milk and giving direct delivery of butter, that is the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And it's more... It's more clear there, you would say, than it is in any other tradition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now God... Ask any religious system "What is God?" he cannot... What is God? They cannot explain. And we are saying, "Here is God, Kṛṣṇa." So which is better? If you search after gold and you do not know what is gold... Eh? And if you... If some authorized friend gives, "Here is gold. You take it." That is easier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So the strength and the value is in knowing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Knowing what gold is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the only business of human being, to know the Absolute Truth, God. That is the only business. Otherwise what is the difference between cats and dogs and human being? They do not care to know what is God. So if human being also in the same status, doesn't care to know what is God, then what is the difference between dogs and human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> People, various people read your writings, your commentaries, and they, they react to them sometimes with reservation because they see your writings as dogmatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> They see your writings... Some people see your writings as dogmatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or "He is dogmatic." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> They say, "He is dogmatic," okay. Do you feel that you are dogmatic or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You find out any passage in my book dogmatic, then you say dogmatic. Any page you open, where is dogmatic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Well, dogmatic, to call someone else dogmatic means to start with that you don't agree with what they are saying. If I agree with you and you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to agree. You open any passage of my book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Well, some people would say to insist that Kṛṣṇa is the only way, that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The only thing that God is one, that you have to accept. God cannot be many. If God has got competitor, then he is not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if we don't admit Kṛṣṇa is the only God then you present who is only God. You say me. Either you have to learn from me or I have to learn from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So to insist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you do not know what is God you cannot say, "Kṛṣṇa is not God." As soon as you say, "Kṛṣṇa is not God," that means you must know what is God. You present. But if you cannot present, you say, "No, I do not know God," then you cannot say, "Kṛṣṇa is not God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are dogmatic. Dogmatically they are saying, "Kṛṣṇa is not God." He does not know God and he says, "Kṛṣṇa is not God." So what is this nonsense? You do not know God. How you can say Kṛṣṇa is not God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I agree with you, I just... I want to get... (laughter) If we're dogmatic, we're on the same side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not dogmatic. Those people who are talking us as dogmatic, he is dogmatic. He does not know God, and when God is presented before him, he says, "No, He is not God." That is dogmatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Would you... Do you feel that those who've had genuine religious, spiritual understanding would not have that kind of argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One... We say... I do not say, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that... Find out this verse,</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Find out. Seventh chapter.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as one denies Kṛṣṇa is not God, then he comes within those categories: miscreant, rascal, lowest of the mankind, his knowledge is taken away by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and he's a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> (laughs) That's a strong statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is God. If he does not know, then he must be amongst these groups.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What if someone says, "Śiva is God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may say, but <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> doesn't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you'll find, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Nobody or no principle is greater than Me." Then who can be God? God is great. Here the great says, "There is no more greater principle than Me." Then who can be God? People generally know God is great. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not only He says but it is confirmed by great authorities like Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, all the big, big ācāryas, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Vyāsadeva, authorities. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> So how you can deny?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You refer to Rāmānujācārya as an important person. Where does he... Where does he fit into your, the Caitanya tradition? He's accepted as an authority. His, the <span class="Italic">Śrī Bhāṣya</span> is studied, accepted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya has written comment on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Caitanya philosophy is discussed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would see no basic difference between Rāmānuja's position and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot be different because both of them are Vaiṣṇava. So this is the common point, that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is preaching Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord. Rāmānujācārya was preaching Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord. So where is difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Well, I don't see a difference, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People know it. Things equal to the same thing are equal to one another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What about certain other traditions; Ishnamadeva(?), Tukārāma, some of the poet saints of Maharastra. Where...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Tukārāma accepted Viṣṇu as the Supreme. He accepted the process of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He accepted Caitanya Mahāprabhu as his guru so there is no difference between Tukārāma and Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So Tukārāma, you would say, is teaching the same thing as Caitanya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, saṅkīrtana. And Kṛṣṇa is teaching the same thing. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So by saying that the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism is, and Caitanya, are the central way of... You are not excluding...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You would not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You are not excluding the Pandarpur tradition of Tukārāma, Rāmanitoba, (indistinct), you are not excluding the Alavars and Rāmancha, but you are saying all of these groups, all of these teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tukārāma accepts Caitanya Mahaprabhu as his guru. Then where is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that Lord Vitoba and Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You see as the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vitoba means Viṣṇu. They call Vitoba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And the Alavars, the Alavars of Tamil Nadu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alavar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Alavar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is also Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You would accept their teachings also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So the real question then is Vaiṣṇavas and others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> The central teaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vaiṣṇava and non-Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Vaiṣṇava and non-Vaiṣṇava. So it's not a question of sectarian differences within Vaiṣṇavism. [break] And you would see the worshipers of Śiva as impersonalists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You would see... All of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Śaivites, the Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Śaṅkarācārya, I know he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śaṅkarācārya's theory is the ultimate, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. And one can imagine a personal form for the benefit of the worshiper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But there are some worshipers of Śiva who would be personalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You would deny that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all impersonalists. They are <span class="Italic">pañcopāsana. Pañcopāsana</span> means the ultimate, Absolute Truth is impersonal and Śaṅkarācārya recommended that you cannot worship the impersonal, so you conceive a personal form. So that he recommended five: the sun-god, Lord Śiva, Durgā, and Gaṇeśa, and? What else? And Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Viṣṇu. Pañca (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But after you are per..., become, you are perfect, then you merge into the impersonal. That is Śaṅkara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You would see all worshipers of Śiva as following basically that idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are devotees. Just like we, we offer all respect to Lord Śiva. We consider Śiva as the best of the Vaiṣṇavas. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇavānām yathā śambhu.</span> And we have got <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> from Śiva. He is considered one of the authority of Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would, you would include...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our conception of Śiva is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Where would Basavana fit in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Where would you place Basavana in relation with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Basavana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Basavana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Lingayat. Lingayat teacher. The Śaivite, Śaivite...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You would say impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. They say <span class="Italic">Śivāham,</span> "I am Śiva." They are impersonalist. If you are Śiva then why you worshiping Śiva? That is impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So any position which would deny the difference between the devotee and God, you would see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Is impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The impersonalist theory is that I am now devotee. As soon as I become perfect I become one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their theory. Then there is no more difference. In the preliminary stage, when I am not perfect, I am worshiping some imaginary form of God. But when I become perfect there is no need of worshiping, I become one with God. This is impersonal. Now, actually, the Supreme has no form so they recommend whichever form you like to worship you can select out of these five. But their destination is the same. So somebody likes "I worship Śiva," somebody says "I worship Gaṇeśa," somebody says, "I worship Durgā," and Sūrya, or somebody says, "I worship Viṣṇu." So this Vaiṣṇava is impersonalist. You'll find amongst <span class="Italic">smārta brāhmaṇas</span> there are also some of them Vaiṣṇavas, but they are impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would... You would say that those, those <span class="Italic">smārtas</span> say, and I know <span class="Italic">smārta brāhmaṇas</span> who are worshipers of Viṣṇu. You would say they still are impersonalists in some ultimate sense because at some point they would deny...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is very difficult to pick them out. Most of the so-called Vaiṣṇavas, they are impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Some, I suspect, are more Vaiṣṇavas than they are <span class="Italic">smārtas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto mām?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>nitya-yuktā upāsate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.14]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perpetually. It is not that I am worshiping now and when I am perfect I become one. That is impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> But someone who sees devotion as the not just a stage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say everything one; no devotee, no devotion, and no person. Everything becomes one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that would then be the deciding test, as it were, of whether one were a serious devotee or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotee means serious devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Not only that one is devoted now, but that one sees the goal as perpetual devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Nitya-yukta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And which never is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The word is used, <span class="Italic">nitya-yukta. Nitya-yukta</span> means perpetually. If a devotee is to merge into the existence of the Lord then why this word is used, <span class="Italic">nitya-yukta. Upāsana.</span> Not only <span class="Italic">nitya-yukta, upāsana. Upāsana</span> means "you worship Me." As soon as the word is "he worships" that means the worshipable and the mode of worship and the worshiper must be there. That is indicated, <span class="Italic">nitya-yukta,</span> perpetual. But the Māyāvādīs or these impersonalists, they think that it is temporary. I am devotee temporarily. As soon as I become perfect I become one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that you would see then, in terms of, in terms of some kind of theological structure, you would see that Puruṣottama as always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Uttama, uttama</span> means the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Always superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the word, <span class="Italic">puruṣottama. Puruṣottama</span> means supreme or superior. So there must be inferior, otherwise, how he is superior? Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as he is the superior, professor, or the, what is called? Junior or senior. As soon as called senior, there must be junior. Without junior there is no question of senior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that the Puruṣottama always stands beyond, always, is other, in addition to be in also everything that there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless He is eternally there, then how the devotee will eternally, <span class="Italic">nitya-yukta upāsana,</span> whom to worship? <span class="Italic">Nitya-yukta upāsana.</span> Unless Puruṣottama is everlasting Puruṣottama then where is the question of worship everlasting? So the Māyāvādīs, they do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Well, would you... Do you equate then the impersonalists and the Māyāvādīs? Are they the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Almost the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> At some point I guess they would have to be almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> At some point I suppose they would almost have to be because to be an impersonalist you would have to deny the ultimate reality of phenomenon, which would make you a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They accept this form of God as <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Therefore we call them Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Any form of God, including the Puruṣa. So that your, your central existence, or certainly one of your central existences would be that the ultimate reality is personal, that it is known as Viṣṇu, possessing all qualities.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">vadanti tat tattva vidas<br class="calibre2"/>tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam<br class="calibre2"/>brahmeti paramātmeti<br class="calibre2"/>bhagavān iti śabdyate<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.11]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Human life is meant for understanding the <span class="Italic">tattva.</span> Then the question will be what is that <span class="Italic">tattva</span> or ultimate truth? And that is described. <span class="Italic">Tattva</span> is realized in three phases: Brahman, impersonal Brahman; Paramātmā, localized Paramātmā; and Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So it's the mistake... The mistake of the impersonalist then is to identify the complete reality with Brahman, which is only one aspect of the complete reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like finger. Finger is one of the item of the whole body. You can't say, "Yes, the finger is my body," because the finger is not the whole body. Similarly, everything is part and parcel of the whole but that does not mean that everything is whole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And these realities are in a hierarchy in the sense that Brahman, Paramātman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahman is everything. Brahman is also <span class="Italic">māyā</span> Brahman, (indistinct) is Brahman. <span class="Italic">Śabda idaṁ khalv brahman.</span> Because it is the manifestation of Brahman. Brahman's energy. Just like here in this room. Daytime there is sun, but sun is ninety three miles away; ninety three millions miles. But where there is sunshine we can say, "Here is sun."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that the problem is not the identification of everything with Brahman, which is correct, but the failure to realize that there is the Paramātmā or the Puruṣottama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supreme Person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Which is beyond this and includes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I have got so many branches, hundred branches. So everyone knows that I am something, but that does not mean I am present everywhere. My student(?) has got this tape..., hundreds of thousands of tape recorders to record my speech and then you speak the same thing that I am speaking, but I am not there. And that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br class="calibre2"/>mat sthāni sarva bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Hm? Find out. Everything is God but God is not everything. He is simultaneously one and different. We therefore say that everything is God but not that everything is..., not that God is everywhere. But because everything is God, everything, with everything you can realize God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br class="calibre2"/>mat sthāni sarva bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All things are in Me but I am not in them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So the failure is a failure to go beyond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> The failure is a failure to go beyond, to realize beyond that level of identity, that there is a Lord, who is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāvādī philosophy is defective. They say if everything is God then where is the Lord's separate existence. That is their defect. That is materialist theory. If you take a big paper and make it into small pieces and throw it away, then the big paper is lost. (laughs) The Māyāvādī thinks like that, that if everything is Brahman, Brahman is distributed, then where is..., why you call the Supreme Lord? They think that Brahman being distributed, He is finished. This is Māyāvādī. He does not know the potency of God. And that is stated in <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate<br class="calibre2"/>pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya<br class="calibre2"/>pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Iso</span> Invocation]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">In the material sense one minus one is equal to zero. In the spiritual world <span class="Italic">pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya.</span> The one is <span class="Italic">pūrṇa</span> and if you take the whole one it is still one. That they cannot understand, the poor brain. They think materially. If the one is complete and if one is taken away then it becomes zero. What kind of God is only zero? But <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> says <span class="Italic">pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate.</span> If from the complete you take the complete, it still it is complete. That they cannot understand. That is God. We say why complete is complete always? Why complete may be zero? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So God can create everything out of Himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> And still be complete as He was before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can see one material example, that the sun, for millions and trillions of years it is distributing sunshine, heat, but still it is full. If it is possible materially, what about the Supreme Lord? Five thousand years or five millions of years the degree of temperature in the sunshine was the same as it is now. If it is materially so possible how much it is possible spiritually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Is that... It's difficult for people outside the Kṛṣṇa consciousness group to see what the purpose of the movement is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> It's difficult for people outside the society of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to see what the purpose is. How would you understand the purpose? Simply to make God known? How would you state...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our purpose is how to become happy. Everyone is struggling how to become happy. Somebody is thinking that "If I can get money then I'll be happy." Somebody is thinking that "If we become one with the Supreme, then I'll be happy." And somebody thinks that "If I can get material power, then I'll be happy." So those who are thinking in terms of money, they are <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> And those who are thinking in terms of becoming one, they are <span class="Italic">jñānīs.</span> And those who are thinking in terms of getting material power, they are yogis. But the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> they don't want any such perfection. They, <span class="Italic">bhaktis,</span> "Let me worship the Supreme, that's all." Therefore he has already (indistinct) and they are all in want. <span class="Italic">Bhakta</span> is satisfied simply by worshiping the Lord. <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi.</span> And all others, <span class="Italic">karmīs, jñānīs,</span> yogis, they want something so they cannot be happy. So if happiness is my aim, then I must become a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> otherwise there is no happiness. You are always in want. Somebody is in want of money, somebody is in want to becoming one with the Supreme, and somebody wants to show some jugglery, mysticism. So they want something. And a devotee, he doesn't want all these things. He wants to serve Kṛṣṇa, that's all. No demand. And he serves Kṛṣṇa without any motive. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So what you are doing is simply showing people how to be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. That is the real want, how to become happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> It's remarkable how complicated simple things get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The example is also very simple. Just like a child is crying and somebody is offering some milk, somebody is offering something but he is still crying. Could not find any cause. Then when the child goes to the mother's lap, immediately (claps)-stops. He understands immediately, "Now I am on the lap of my mother, then everything is all right." <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> Everyone is hankering after making some profit, this way, that way, this way, that way. But when one becomes, gets that supreme thing then he thinks, "Oh, I don't want anything." That is happiness. Unhappiness due to want. So the <span class="Italic">karmīs, jñānīs,</span> yogis, they are all in want. They want something. <span class="Italic">Bhaktas</span> are also sometimes in want. They want Kṛṣṇa. And in absence of Kṛṣṇa they are very unhappy, but that unhappiness is greater than happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is greater than happiness. And the Māyāvādī, <span class="Italic">karmī, jñānī,</span> they cannot understand. They will say, "Your <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are also crying for Kṛṣṇa, for want of Kṛṣṇa." But they do not know that this want is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you have been extremely generous with your time and your wisdom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I enjoy(?) that. And that is what the whole human society (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Well I... I have been a friend for many years now. I suspect... I suspect sometimes that I may end up as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> among your line at some point. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> does not mean change of dress. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> means everything for Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> What is your view of Śrī Aurobindo? (loud laughter) Or should I have left well enough alone? He is not an impersonalist, he's not a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says that above the Māyāvāda philosophy there is something else, super. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">...bhakti,</span> but he could not understand because he did not take any education from realized person. He wanted to realize himself. That is his defect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So one who... You would see his effort to transcend, I suppose you would call it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That effort was for life after life. Then when his effort will be successful he will realize Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So his problem was the effort to attempt to do this on his own without going through...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> The guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it will take time. Just like a man searching after the right path but he does not care to ask anybody, he is loitering in the forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> You... I'm sure you're familiar with his essays on the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Which I think are generally quite good, his essays on the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> themselves. Are there places there that you would strongly disagree with in his, what he says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we disagree with the whole system because he is trying to understand the Absolute Truth by his own effort. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> So you would say then that no matter... He may have the right idea, but he has not, he has not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may be a great thoughtful man but (indistinct) ...a realized man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Not realized. I'm sorry I raised the question right at the last minute but it occurred to me and I was interested in your answer. So, thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have given him <span class="Italic">prasāda?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are staying here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> No, I'm going back to Lancaster this evening. I have tomorrow... Tomorrow morning we are getting a group of students together to go to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> I am not going but we're sending seventeen students to India, leaving tomorrow evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You can stay at our guest house in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Ah, could I pass on the people an invitation from you that that would be possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Definitely we can arrange it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Because I know there are students in the group who would like to visit Vṛndāvana. And you, I think, talked to some this spring and you were there. I know that the senior student with the group is very interested in going to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have nice facility there. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> That's true. They're going to be in Delhi for a week or so. It would be great if they could get out to Vṛndāvana just for a day. They can come back later when they have more time. So... Would they have to make preliminary arrangements or could they...? Is there some way they could make arrangements from Delhi to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Afterwards we can discuss it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Okay. So.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Hopkins:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
