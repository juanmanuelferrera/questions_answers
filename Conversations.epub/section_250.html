<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Muscles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another. (pause) The Japanese, they eat this seaweed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is good for the fish-eaters, because it has got fishy taste, although it is vegetable. (pause) Those who are fish-eaters, even by smelling fish, fishy, they'll increase their appetite. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Habit is like that. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You once said that the urad dahl is a good substitute for that fish taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Protein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is containing protein. Taste is also. (pause) This seaweeds, all over the ocean. When passing ship, you can see. All over. Where is their roots? Because the ocean is very deep, the root grows from the bottom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, it doesn't have roots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Doesn't have roots. Floats on top of the water. (pause)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they travel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's not really a well-traveled route. The ones that do travel are usually out farther in the channel. There's a big point. So they just go farther out so they don't have to curve around, all around the coast. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...animals, goes like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara &amp; Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Crabs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Crabs and lobsters, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Birds. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got suitable beak, suitable beak to capture. Yes. (pause) What is this big bird?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> A seagull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They also eat fish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Fish and garbage, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? If we add the conservation of energy from the invocation of <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad,</span> it will be a great challenge to science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That is conservation of energy. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam idam, pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The understanding in science is that if I burn a piece of wood, that wood contains originally cellulose. So it has certain amount carbons, and a certain amount hydrogens. So if I burn it, that carbon will be converted to smaller molecules like carbon dioxide and water. So if I balance it, starting from the original cellulose, so I'll get a certain number of carbon atoms and hydrogens. So the matter is conserved. In other words, it is not lost. That is the understanding of the science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we also, we also say. The energy, we take the sum total, material energy, that is conserved. It is displayed again. When there is annihilation, the whole energy goes back to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yānti māmikām, prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the original matter is changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The original substance that I started with, changed to some other form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is just like you take cotton. You make thread. Another form. Then from thread, you make cotton cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's not lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It just changes it's form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The original cotton is there. Simply form is changing. This is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Is it the same from <span class="Italic">pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya... [Iso</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything is preserved. <span class="Italic">Kārya kāraṇam</span>, cause and effect. In the effect, the cause is there. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Veda</span> says: <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma</span>, everything is Brahman. Because the cosmic manifestation is the effect of the cause, energy of God. Therefore, in the effect there is God. <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā.</span> "In impersonal form, I am existing everywhere." God says, Kṛṣṇa says. <span class="Italic">Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Everything is existing on Me." <span class="Italic">Na cāhaṁ teṣu ava...</span> "But I am not there." This is the personal and impersonal features of the Lord. The whole cosmic manifestation is the impersonal, it is resting on the energy of God, but you cannot find God here. The example is just like a big businessman, he has got a big factory. The factory's depending on the energy of that man, but if you want to see that man in the factory, you cannot see. Is that example nice? You cannot say that the factory is existing without him. It is in his brain the whole factory's running on. But if you want to find out where is he, that will be difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But he's there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's there. He's there by his energy. He's there. Therefore in all government offices, the picture of the president is there. What is the idea? Here is also president present. But if you want to see him, then you have to go to his headquarters. Similarly Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere, but if you want to talk with Kṛṣṇa, then you have to go Goloka Vṛndāvana. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sailboat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh yeah, sailboat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sailboat. [break] ...what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Seaweed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seaweed. The Chinese, China, China grass? What is called? China grass? Some foodstuff is sold in the stores, China grass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yeah, I think they dry it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they go under some chemical process. That gentleman, Mr. Patel, in Ahmedabad, whose guest I was, he's doing this business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, this can be taken as food?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. under some chemical process. No, as it is can be taken. The Japanese take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is one of the targets of scientific research. They're going to find food from the ocean now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is already food. What is this? You are You have labor (indistinct). There is already food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're going to find more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why more? Let them eat all the fishes first of all. Rascal, what more? They would take all the fishes and eat first, finish it. Then, then search for another. Simply rascaldom. Simply to take money from the government: "I'm making some research."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Cheating, simply. And the rascal government will supply money: "Yes." There is already food, sir. First of all you eat. Finish it. Then you make research for others. He cannot eat all the fishes even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're called "new food."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> "New foods." food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New foods? Why don't you find out new debt. Why it is old? Find out some new debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Some new sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> New sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same old sex. Either in the naked club or at home, the thing is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They call it "new" because they never tasted before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Taste. Everyone is tasting sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is, the food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I..., Germany, in the war, they extracted fat from stool because stool is full of fat and hypophosphytes. Stool. So there was scarcity of fat. So they were extracting fat from stool. By scientific method. There was no fat available in wartime. That my Godbrother, Sadānanda, when he came India, so I asked him that: "Your German people, I've heard that German people are very stout and strong. Why you are lean and thin?" So he replied that: "During the war days, there was control. So I was getting fat, butter, simply because we were children." He showed his wrist watch, "to this, this much. Only for children, this much butter, weekly, once." That means under, under-nourished. So therefore they are finding out fat from stool. And in the concentration camp, Kīrtanānanda told me, actually they ate their own stools. And who was telling me...? Śrutakīrti, you were telling me that in the, what is called? Capsule? They turn their stool into food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Oh, that wasn't me. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, they turn the urine, they turn the urine into water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But someone was saying they also turn their stool into food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I don't know about that. I know they change the urine into water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The urine, you just distill. Then uh... No urine, if it is, if one distills, turns to water. So the salt is deposited in the flask, and the water, pure water will come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you invent this "New food"? New aerated water, manufactured from urine. Advertise. You'll get more customer. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> will give him intelligence to waste his time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Chewing the chewed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Instead of saving time for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will give him intelligence how to waste time. This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Human life is so valuable that one second of this life should not be wasted. But these people are simply prescribing how to waste time. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So this (indistinct) thing is inquiring in the wrong direction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In the wrong direction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're inquiring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is right, but when we speak that the ultimate shelter is Kṛṣṇa, that they will deny. Therefore they're wrong. Just like you are coming this side. If I say: "Come to here," they'll say: "Why shall I go to there?" That is their fault. We are requesting everyone that: "Accept Kṛṣṇa in the center. All your research work will be successful." That they'll not. (pause) <span class="Italic">Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> They'll not accept one thing, God. That is their business. (pause) <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. (pause) Jellyfish is also eaten by man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Jellyfish? No, I don't think so. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are meant for the birds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Fishes, other fish eat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, fish also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water, they're also composition of atomic grains?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The hydrogen and oxygen, they're called compound. Compound of hydrogen and oxygen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So hydrogen and oxygen, they have got grains, molecular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So it is called molecules, molecule of water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There are innumerable molecules in water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere. In the sunshine also, there is molecules, shining particles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're called photons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Protons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Photons. P, H, O, T, O, N.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, photons. Similarly we are also photons of Kṛṣṇa. That is our original position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spot, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Emanations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) How the sand is made? According to scientists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> By the combination of, when one atom of silica, two atoms of oxygen. Called silicon dioxide, the chemical name, or silica. But this is existing as a silicate, as a salt of sodium, magnesium, silicate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is salt in the water. So from that salt it is produced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. It reacts with the sodium, in the water, sodium in the water, in salt, that sodium reacts with silicic acid. So from sodium silicate, that becomes sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's not rocks pounded down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, rocks? Oh... No, we can make silicate very easily just by mixing the alkali, sodium and then acid, is just the reaction between the acid in the base. So forming an acid...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far we know, there is this sand, combined with silicate of soda, makes glass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, glass is nothing but silicate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Finer sort. Normally silicate is shining, but this is not shining because it contains various mixtures. Not only soda, but other magnesium, calcium silicates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Silicate of soda is mixed with soap also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Adulteration. That's not first-class soap. Washing soap, they are mixed with silicate of soda. (pause) What is this cottage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That small cottage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This one there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, a lavatory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, in the truck.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, in the... Moving cottage. Coming to primitive life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They all have the fashion. Everyone has a truck with a cottage on the back so they can move around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like the tortoise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like the tortoise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is new invention?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, it's not new, but it's just gotten popular over the last few years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, (indistinct-Bengali?)</div>
