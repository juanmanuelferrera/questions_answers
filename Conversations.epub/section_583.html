<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> This morning Śrīla Prabhupāda's morning walk takes place on Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, on May 3lst, 1975. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...he thinks, "I am on the surf," then next life he will be fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> All the surfers will be fish? If they think that within the water, they will be fish. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Then they have to come all the way back to the human form of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...childhood we used to play one chessboard, that one serpent is there. If the, what is called, the <span class="Italic">guti(?)</span> ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Dice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dice, yes. If the dice falls on the face of the serpent, immediately it comes down. We have to come to the tail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Back to the start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is like that. <span class="Italic">Goloka nadha(?).</span> One is trying to go to back to home, back to Godhead. A little discrepancy... Mahārāja Bhārata? Yes, he became deer. Therefore we should be very careful. That is the instruction. Even Mahārāja Bhārata, he fell down. So therefore how much careful we should be. These are the instructions to become careful. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">,</span> always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will save you. That Kṛṣṇa chanting and hearing, that will keep us safe. Example is given: just like a polluted woman is doing all household work, but she is always thinking when she will meet with her paramour at night. This example is... Similarly, we may be engaged in different material activities, but if we keep our faith in Kṛṣṇa, then it will save us. It is possible. Just like the example: the woman is engaged in household affairs very diligently, but she is always thinking when she will meet her paramour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> If we keep that example in mind, then it becomes easier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Another example is given. In South India there are a class of dancer. They keep a waterpot on the head, and they will dance, but it will not fall down. Careful. [break] ...<span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-padaravindayor kṣīṇa-tavābhrāṇi ca sākaṁ pramodaḥ.</span> If we remember always Kṛṣṇa, then all our inauspicity is driven away, and prosperity increases. <span class="Italic">Sākaṁ pramodaḥ.</span> [break] If you know a little Sanskrit, they will see the composition of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> so fine. It is not possible to be composed now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five thousand years ago it was composed by Vyāsadeva. [break] ...only for the Juhu Beach so many hotels are being maintained. Even this Holiday Inn, they have also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Juhu Beach is a big beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes. [break] ...I told you, in my childhood I was consulting the time table, "What is the fare of Jagannātha Purī and Vṛndāvana?" (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> You said it was two rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not two rupees. Jagannātha Purī at that time was four rupees, four annas or one anna. And Vṛndāvana was six rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six rupees from Calcutta. So I was dreaming "When I get this four rupees or six rupees, I shall go." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> That is not material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> You were desiring to worship... You were worshiping Jagannātha, weren't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Rathayātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> You wanted to go and visit Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> All the people come out on their porch and they watch us. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...see (sea?), you can... Water is so clear, ten feet down you can see clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any sea anywhere. When I was traveling by ship, I used to see ten feet down crystal clear. It is very clear water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> But you cannot drink it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is God's supremacy. "If I don't give you water to drink, you cannot drink." And still, they are independent. Just see the fun. Even water, three-fourths of water, you cannot use a drop of water for drinking unless God gives you. He creates the cloud and give you. That is not your arrangement. You cannot do. Still they are independent. <span class="Italic">Jale kali-vāsa, nāme tila phyāsa.</span> Sometimes sailors,(?) for being thirsty, they died in water. How they declare independence from Him? "There is no God. There is no authority. We are independent. We can do whatever we like." Childish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> I think it's because they are meat-eaters, all their intelligence is completely gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Vina pasughnat: [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">]</span> Unless one is meat-eater, nobody can be disinterested in God's affairs. Only the meat-eaters, <span class="Italic">vinā paśughnāt,</span> killers of animal. <span class="Italic">Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> This glorification of God is especially done by persons who are completely free from material attachment. <span class="Italic">Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagiyamanad bhavauśādhi [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> And it is the medicine of getting free from this material bondage. <span class="Italic">Bhavauśādhi.</span> And it is also very pleasing. Otherwise why they come to hear the Hare Kṛṣṇa? It's such a nice thing. Who does not like it unless he is a killer of animals? So even the killer of animals, they also hear. It is so nice. Only the gross killers, most abominable, they do not hear it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Last night we saw groups of people on and off going by holding their ears. They were putting their fingers in their ears.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagiyamanad bhavauśādhi chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hawaiians, they are not very much inclined to read. So does that mean we should distribute lots of <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> here profusely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The Hawaiian people, they don't read very much, but they like to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them, yes. (end)</div>
