<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">...ācāryas</span> and <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> of all the <span class="Italic">sampradāyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> One of the leading <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> of the Rāmānuja-sampradāya has endorsed us as being bona fide Vaiṣṇavas, and also one of the main Aṣṭamaṭhas (?) in Uḍupi, the place of Madhvācārya, has given a letter to define that "The disciple of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, His Divine Grace, is doing very good work for the <span class="Italic">sanātana dharma,</span> and they are bona fide Vaiṣṇavas. So these letters are very good for our preaching work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Śrī Raṅgam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Also in Śrī Raṅgam, the leading <span class="Italic">paṇḍita,</span> the leading priest of the Śrī Raṅgam temple, that big Viṣṇu temple... We had a program there, and he's very much impressed by your work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He's the descendant of Veṅkata Bhaṭṭa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And that is... His house is called Mahāprabhu Śālā. So Lord Caitanya stayed in this house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He also gave a very nice letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's Gauḍīya-sampradāya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Rāmānuja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this Veṅkata Bhaṭṭa, because Bhaṭṭa, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa was Caitanya Mahāprabhu's disciple. <span class="Italic">Śrī-rūpa sanātana bhaṭṭa-raghunātha, śrī-jīva gopāla-bhaṭṭa dāsa-raghunātha.</span> They were direct disciples of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There's a big sign on the Śrī Raṅgam temple: "Only Hindus allowed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So we took a photograph of ourselves standing next to him with the sign in the picture. So we can use that, in case anybody tries to check us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one thing, if you can do, that India, at the present moment, that Swami Cinmayananda is prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's very big. Especially in the South.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) So if you can subdue him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> We'll take care of that, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be great triumph. He's a nonsense. That's... But he's very popular at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is like Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He tells some jokes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He always tells nonsense jokes during his lectures. Therefore children and elderly widows are very much attracted to him for his flowery language and joking. But he has no substantial philosophy like yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> We went to his program and sold books to the crowd.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> But some way or other, he has some respect for you, Prabhupāda, for the great work you have done, Cinmayananda Swami. He has some respect for you. He knows...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he, he wants to keep his prestigious position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes. On your order, we shall try to hamper that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, tactfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> By preaching your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep him as friend. He's friendly. So don't irritate him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I think the best way would be to out-preach him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Out-preach him. Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...letter for our authorization to enter temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> You, you sent him a letter for him to copy, and he did that on his letterhead and Vishwa Hindu Parishad. He is favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I met him once. He is addicted to snuff very, very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Constantly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Even during his lectures he makes gestures so that he can take snuff without anybody knowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> And one of his favorite styles is that whenever he goes to a city, he always stays with elderly widows, very rich elderly widows, in their houses. Very strange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I think the people know that he is bogus, but they just go for some entertainment because he is so... (Prabhupāda laughs) Yes, they just go for some... Some people go just because they want to hear some nice English, to improve their English knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He speaks good English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Very... He's an orator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's M.A. in English. I know. He's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He used to be, I heard, a journalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, journalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But he got into some big embarrassment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Journalists, they write very good English. Every journalist, they learn how to write good English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He got into some big embarrassment. I don't know how. Then he went to the Himalayas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was in, several times in embarrassment. One friend in Delhi, Mr. Gupta, he told many things about him. He was patronizing him. In those days, when he was not very rich, he had, he gave him 25,000 rupees, that Mr. Gupta. [break] <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I felt uncomfortable. He was clicking his teeth and moving his hands and talking very quickly. It was very uncomfortable just to be in his presence. I was very nervous. He actually contradicted himself. I was saying we should be respected in all Hindu temples. He says, "Yes, you are Hindus." He says, "Jains and Buddhists, they are also Hindus." I said, "How is that?" He says, "Who is Buddha?" I said, "He is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa." He says, "No, aside from that, he is the son of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya."</span> I said, "Then you are bringing it back to birth again." And then he started groping for words and avoiding it. They want to make a unity of Hindus so that they can always sway elections, so that Mohammedan and Christians do not change the election.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we want to make Mohammedans Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. They also do that. They try and... Mainly they try and reconvert the Christians. They get some results. And they pander to the tribal castes so that they don't convert to Christianity. The Mohammedans and Christians have refused to use birth control, so they think that their population will soon outnumber the Hindus. So they are afraid that the Mohammedan and Christian block will sway elections in the future. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmacārīs</span> don't like to take the instructions from the elder devotees, and then they want to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> so they think they can be independent and give orders themself and not listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore not to be given all of a sudden. [break]...to become <span class="Italic">sevaka.</span> Everyone wants to become <span class="Italic">sevya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Served.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And, ultimately, God. <span class="Italic">Se pasha pasha pasha bo...</span> (?) When everything failure, then to become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's why Lord Caitanya said that "I am not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or a..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ vipro na ca nara-patir nāpi vaiśyo...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhṛtyasya-bhṛtya,</span> servant of the servant [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80]. Everyone, if he wants to become a master, that is materialism. (end)</div>
