<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...use this land here now for our vehicles. We want to purchase it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's all our vehicles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What price they want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We haven't started negotiating yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are willing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're willing, they want to sell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No, only up to that bridge. I can show you on the way back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> We've got some pictures we can show you later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...bicycle also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Made where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bicycle? Cycle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Do the car companies make bicycles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, some companies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Oh, yes. Some they do here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...Indian Village?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> It's a section, a suburb, Indian Village. Actually, the old temple used to be in Indian Village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means all residents Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, it was actually, I think it was named for the American Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They used to live here. There was a settlement, the street that the old temple used to be on. [break] Did you purchase any land at Kurukṣetra yet, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government is promising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Oh, that's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have already applied for twenty-five acres. Mr. Candrali,(?) he wanted to make some profit out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think you won the heart of that government official yesterday by saying that Kṛṣṇa's black and we worship Him. (laughter) He liked that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, Detroit River, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big, big ships, they pass under this bridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, on the other side of this island, there's a channel, a freighter channel. That's Canada over there, and this is a small island, Belle Isle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What is that project up ahead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> I guess.... It's got problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, he was asking if they are..., big project, Renaissance Center. They are having some problems building it. (short conversation about where to stop)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, this is where we are going to walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> You should signal for him to stop then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...attract people back to the cities. It's called the Renaissance Project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's, Ambarīṣa's uncle, Henry Ford II, he is building, along with many different companies, a million dollar project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not at Māyāpura? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Ambarīṣa? I was explaining the Renaissance Project, and, ah, to try to attract people back to the city, they are building a million dollar project. Prabhupāda said: "Why not Māyāpura?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lake here dried up or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Looks like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...attracting men to the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Because everyone is leaving the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But not from an industrialist's point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The cities are simply becoming for the low-class people. Cities are simply filled now with the low-class people. No respectable people can walk safely in the streets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In Detroit at five o'clock it becomes like a ghost town. No one walking. They are all afraid. If low-class people move into the buildings, everything becomes rundown, not kept up. So now they're investing millions and millions of dollars to build new buildings, new stores, to make it attractive again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll not attempt to make the low-class men high class. Huh? Why they are lacking that point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually the high-class man and the low-class man, their activities are the same. Simply they are living in bigger and smaller houses. They smoke the same cigarettes and they drink the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say why not make them high class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no high-class men to teach them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Except for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Just like that congressman yesterday, he was speaking, "I am a lawmaker." But he admitted that they are simply patching up here and there wherever they can. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Ambarīṣa? Somebody? Know what this building is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, I don't know this park very well. It's a casino.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's a gambling house, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> I've been visiting your buses, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and managing the book distribution with the buses. It's going very nicely. Ever since Māyāpura all the boys have doubled their collection and distribution. And as soon as all the debts from New York temple are paid, then more and more books can go. We'll try to do everything. [break] The men are just like the army. The van leaders, bus leaders. So everything is very efficient, clean, and very high-powered. [break] ...just two years ago, when we left India, that you wanted an army of <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> always traveling, distributing books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (looking at plaque) Commissioners?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Commissioners of Parks and Boulevards, William Livingston Jr., President; Fred Gunter, Vice-President.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sperimus meliora.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">generibus.</span> Some Latin inscription on the bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> It means to increase their happiness they have built this park. <span class="Italic">Melior</span> means increased happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...Kṛṣṇa there is no happiness. All imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> This way's OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...soldier. A hundred years ago when the north fought the south. This is some memorial. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...devotional service is transcendental to the modes of material nature. That's from the very moment that one first begins to render devotional service? Or gradually? From the first very moment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...of devotional service in the modes of material nature, there's no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Means if you do not follow the regulative principles, then it is mixed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Sometimes devotees think that in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> when Lord Kapila teaches there is devotional service in ignorance and in passion and in goodness, that that may mean your own disciples too. But then some devotees say "No, we're above that designation. It's not mixed devotional service, even though we're neophytes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you voluntarily do not follow, then you fall down. That is in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So where that is described in the Third Canto, Part Four, where it is described about devotional service in ignorance, passion, and goodness, and so forth, that has nothing to do with your disciples then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is my disciple? First of all let him follow strictly the disciplined rules.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> As long as one is following, then he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...above those lower levels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Otherwise, why there is need of regulative principles? He is immediately liberated. If he thinks that "Because I have taken to, I am liberated," then why the rules and regulations?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But as long as he follows the rules and regulations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> [break] ...the <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ</span> platform, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">,</span> immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said <span class="Italic">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa</span> [Bg. 14.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> unalloyed. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yogena sevate,</span> then he's liberated. If it is <span class="Italic">vyabhicāreṇa,</span> sometimes falls down, sometimes..., then it is within <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.</span> The word is <span class="Italic">māṁ ca yaḥ avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena,</span> pure <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Without any falldown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Falldown means deviation from the orders of the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is <span class="Italic">vyabhicāreṇa,</span> that is not <span class="Italic">avyabhicāreṇa.</span> If you are subjected to the attraction of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that is <span class="Italic">vyabhicāreṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If somebody is following the instructions, but if there's attraction for <span class="Italic">māyā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That cannot be. Maybe in the beginning due to past habits, but that must be nil very soon. Otherwise he's not following. Just like fan switched off may move for a little, but not that it will go on moving. Must stop. Switch is off. And if it is going on, then the switch is not yet off. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> A devotee is sometimes subject to hankering or lamentation. That is material though, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In other words, if, at that moment, if he desires something other than Kṛṣṇa, that's a material desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he has to learn it. So long one is not competent in that position, he's subjected, he may fall down. What is that temple light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's a fountain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is just like Jagannātha temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That, right in the distance there with the light on the top. Yeah, same design. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...after us anymore because they don't have the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Detroit has got no money? Such a big industrial city. Neglected. They have got money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're not keeping this park up very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because nobody comes here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Too dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Many of the big parks in the big cities, they are full of thieves and all kinds of other people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they cannot improve the condition of the people. Just like at the airport, everyone is checked. There is no gentlemen. Why everyone is checked? That means the whole mass of people, they're all rogues and thieves. Therefore it is necessary to keep an ideal, an ideal class of men <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Then people will follow. But there is no such.... Everyone is coolie. That's all. Everyone is. They are making everyone coolie. Coolie civilization. One officer came to see me in Perth, Australia. So I told him, this is a civilization of fourth-class men. You remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We heard the tape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You said there must be an ideal class of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no ideal class of men. All fourth class, fifth class, tenth class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He accepted it also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you were present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes. At the finish he said, "Now I'm going back to my fourth-class friends."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This man last night also, he admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no first-class men. All fourth-class men. They do not know what is first-class men. If one has got money, then he's all right. That is Kali-yuga. No qualification. But if you have got money, then it is all right. You are big man. Money's everything at the present moment. People, they are trying to accumulate money by all means. Never mind first class, second class, third class, bring money any way. Rather, if one does not drink, he's a third-class man. And if one drinks, he's first-class man. Civilized. In India, formerly, any gentleman comes, a glass of water or two <span class="Italic">sandeśa</span> was given. Now that is rejected. If a gentleman is not offered a bag(?) of wine and some chicken, then it is not proper reception. [break] ...building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's an office building, a big one in Renaissance Center. Those ones to your left are under construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, templelike.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Templelike, but it is an office building. Those are the buildings they are building their Renaissance Center. They're going to be very tall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] (in car) These people waste money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Frivolousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Childish. They do not know the value of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> These parks are not very regularly attended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Very dirty and overgrown. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the Indian park. Not like American park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Living in the city is a very fearful existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...construction is. Nobody knows when it will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Now they build a building, now they are building so that they will only last for twenty years or so, and then they will tear it down and build new ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> In Boston, they built a very tall building, and already it's sinking. And the windows are falling out, and it cannot be used. Millions of dollars they spent on this building. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...percentage of unemployment in the city. They are always trying to make new jobs for the people because there are so many people not working. And then they claim welfare and the state supports them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The state supports them by welfare. So they are just idle and getting money from the government, and then they just cause trouble. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...storefront building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, this is a black area. The black people move in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> This used to be actually the best street in Detroit. About maybe seventy-five years ago, all the wealthy people lived on this street, Jefferson Avenue, and then the black people moved in and took over, and then all their businesses, they went out of business, and now it's all boarded up. Very dangerous place. All the white people in the suburbs, they live in fear of all the black people in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government cannot manage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No. The mayor is black. The police they cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> The police force is also becoming black. He's putting black men in charge of every department of the city, and they're mismanaging everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is possibility of another civil war?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes. Possibly some sort of a race war or something. In Boston, they have a lot of trouble because of this bussing. They bus the black children into the white neighborhoods to go to school to achieve equal education, and the white communities do not like this. In Boston there has been a lot of violence between the black people and the white people. Very much hatred, very much hate each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes. About a month ago there was a black lawyer, and he was walking out of the City Hall in Boston, and some white people beat him with an American flag. They beat him with an American flag and hurt him very badly, and this caused very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Commotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is hatred within. Artificially they have given equal rights. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> ...because in bad neighborhood, [break] (continues onboard bus)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...two vans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Besides this, well, we have so many more. Ghanaśyāma and the men in the library party, they have three vans, and then the men who finance their travels, they have two vans, so that's another five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Along with this van, another van goes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. And since we have this and the Deity worship, the collecting has increased and the book distribution, because now they're more regulated and it's not so difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have a kitchen in the back, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And a shower and toilet, a sink. It's complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Small house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is fulfilling Caitanya Mahāprabhu's desire: <span class="Italic">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma.</span> Go to every village and town. So you are doing very nice to satisfy the Lord. He wanted this. <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte nagarādi</span>-all over the world. So when He meant all over the world, naturally He meant all the people of the world.
