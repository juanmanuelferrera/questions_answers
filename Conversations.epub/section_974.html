<div class="Heading">Radio Interview<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 27, 1976, London</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Mr. Robinson, Mike Robinson, from London Broadcasting Company. It's a very prominent news program in London, and he wanted to interview you, ask some questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> If I could just spend one or two minutes of your time. Shall I explain the program? We do a religious program for two and a half hours on a Sunday which covers all different religions, and what we'd like is, people in London have seen, you know, many members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement on Oxford Street. And if you would explain more about the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, how it was formed, what you believe, this sort of idea, so that people would have a better understanding of the movement. And I'll just set up a tape recorder first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> This is your biography, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have seen it, encyclopedia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Could we just talk for a minute or two so that we could get all this set up? If you'd like, just to tell me. You're going to India tomorrow, is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am leaving tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And when did you come into England?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He came seven days ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Oh, I see. Your Grace, could I ask you, first, how you pronounce your name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivedanta Swami</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Gee, it's very, very difficult isn't it. Now I understand you're the founder of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Can you tell me how it came to be founded?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> That's the name, is it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. And what's he pointing, that he should...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> He wanted you to see how it's pronounced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Spelled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Oh, thank you very much. Can you tell me how the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement came to be founded?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can tell these things. These ordinary things you can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's being recorded now. It's being recorded directly for the radio program now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda was a student of a great spiritual teacher in India, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> There's a problem with me asking him questions, is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Well, these are, just these preliminary questions. He prefers to discuss mostly the philosophical side. This is like background.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So perhaps I'd like an interview with you as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That would be good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> You want to do it now or later?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> It would perhaps be easier if I could do that one first. You could answer the ones that.... So which questions would he be happier answering? What you believe, that sort of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And develop from that. I'm sorry about that. If I ask you a few questions about what you believe and that sort of, along those lines, and then get some of the background material from some of your other members of the movement. Can you tell me what you believe, what is the philosophy of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is not a question of belief, it is a science, a spiritual movement. Just like a man is living and he's dead, what is the difference? The difference is that the spirit soul or the living force is out of the body. Therefore he's called dead body. So there are two things, anyone can appreciate. One, this body, and other, the living force of the body. So we are speaking of the living force of the body. That is the difference between material and spiritual. As such, in the beginning, it is very difficult for ordinary man to understand what is our movement, but our movement begins when one understands that he is soul or something other than this body. Then this movement begins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And when we understand that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can understand at any moment, but it requires little brain. Just like a child is growing or changing the body. A child is becoming a boy and the boy is becoming a young man. The body is changing, but the child cannot understand that his body's changing. Actually, the body is changing. So the young man's body is also changing, and the old man's body. Therefore the conclusion is that the body is changing, and the occupier of the body, it is the same. So on this logic, the occupier being the same and the bodies changing, it is to be concluded that when this body is changed, we get another body. This is called transmigration of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So when people die, it is just the physical body that dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is explained very elaborately in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita: na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācin na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Are you there referring to references from the scriptures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so many references. It is a series of education. What is that? Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin<br class="calibre2"/>nāyaṁ bhūtva bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam purāṇo<br class="calibre2"/>na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.20]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Thank you very much for reading that. So can you explain to me just a bit more, if the soul is undying, does everybody's soul go to be with God when they die? Do you have a belief in a heaven or a hell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. If he's qualified, if he qualifies himself in this life to go back home, back to Godhead, then he can go. If he does not qualify himself, he gets another material body, and there are 8,400,000 different forms of body. And according to his desire and <span class="Italic">karma,</span> activities, the nature, laws of nature, gives him a body. Just like a man infects some disease and he develops that disease. Is it difficult to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> It's very difficult to understand all of it. Perhaps we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now suppose somebody has infected some smallpox disease. After seven days it develops. What is that called, that period?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Incubation? Is that the word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, incubation, no, another technical, yes, that after some time, the disease comes. There is a technical name. Anyway, so you cannot avoid it. If you have infected some disease, it will develop by nature's law. It is not possible to avoid it. Similarly, during our this life, we are in association with different modes of material nature, and that will decide what kind of body we are going to get next life. That is strictly under the laws of nature. Everything is under the laws of nature. You have no control over it; you are completely dependent, but people, on account of dull brain, they think that they are free. They are not free. They are imagining they are free. They're completely under the laws of nature. So this next birth will be decided according to my activities this life, sinful or pious, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Your Grace, if we could perhaps go back over that just for a minute-you said nobody is free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But are you saying that if we live a good life we in some way determine our future as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So we are free to choose in so far as what we believe important. I mean religion is important, because if we believe in God and live a good life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of believe. Don't bring this question-belief. It is law. Just like there is government, you believe or not believe, who cares for you? That is government. Similarly, you believe or not believe, there is God. If you don't believe in God and do independently whatever you like, then you'll be punishable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Does it matter what religion you believe? Does it matter which religion you believe? Would it matter if one was a devotee of Hare Kṛṣṇa...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of which religion, it is a question of science, that what is your position. You are a spiritual being, you are under the laws of nature. So you may believe.... Just like you may believe in Christian religion, I may believe in Hindu religion, but it does not mean that a Christian child is not going to become a boy. We are talking of the science, that the child become a boy. This is natural law. It is not that because you are Christian you are becoming a boy, or because I am Hindu I am becoming.... Everyone becomes a boy. So similarly, the laws of nature is applicable to everyone. You believe this religion or that religion, it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So you're saying there's only one God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Provided you believe in that one God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One God, one God's law, nature's law, and we are all under that nature's law, under the control of the Supreme. So if we think that we are free, we can do independently, that is our foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Can you explain to me then what difference it makes being a member of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa movement means one who is serious to understand this science-he's member of Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. There's no question of he belongs to some group, anyone, student. Just like in a college, students can be admitted. He may be a Christian, he may be a Hindu, he may be Muhammadan, it doesn't matter. It is a science to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And what difference would it make to him, being taught what the Hare Kṛṣṇa people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the beginning of education, that you are a spirit soul. Because you are spirit soul you are changing bodies. This is the understanding, beginning A-B-C-D. So when the body is finished, annihilated, you are not finished-you get another body. Just like you have got this coat and shirt. If you change tomorrow, you come to me in another shirt or another coat, that means you are not finished. This science has to be understood. Then one can make progress about the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I'm beginning to understand. What I'm finding difficult is, for instance, we see on Oxford Street a lot of people who are handing out Hare Kṛṣṇa literature. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the literature, how to convince them about the spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And you're really not concerned whether or not they join the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't matter. One must be.... Our mission is to educate. People are in ignorance. They are living in fool's paradise, that he is his body. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> When the body's finished, everything is finished. That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And you're basically just concerned to tell them that there's a spiritual dimension to life. And if they then were to find that spiritual dimension in something like the Anglican Church, that would not worry you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know what is Anglican Church...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Sorry, the English Church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but we are concerned with the educational propaganda, that "You are not this body. Body is your covering, shirt and coat. Within the body you are living, and as you are spirit soul, you have got so many things to know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Sorry, could I just change the tape? Perhaps if we can pick up where we were, if you could just carry on. Perhaps if I can carry on from where I was, that what I'm trying to understand is the difference it makes, a person being a member...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You try to understand this, that as you have got experience of change of body.... Have you got or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, I've got the difference there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, the so-called death is also a change of body. This has to be understood first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, I think I've got that far. Now if we could go on from there. And then we said, you said that it therefore made a difference in the life after death, how you lived, that there were natural laws that determined that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The process is that the spirit soul is invisible in our material eyes, very small. So after the destruction of this gross body, there is another body, subtle body-mind, intelligence and ego. So at the time of death, when finishing this body, mind works. So, according to that process, the mind carries the small spirit soul to another body. Just like the air carries the flavor. Nobody can see wherefrom this rose flavor is coming, but it is being carried by the air, very subtle. You cannot see, but it is being done. Similarly, the soul is very subtle. It is being carried by the mind. According to the mind, he enters into the womb of another mother through the semina of the father, and then he develops a particular type of body given by the mother. It may be human being, it may be cat, dog or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So we will come back in another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then, that's when the body is developed, he comes out and his work begins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Are you say that we were perhaps something else before we were born as well? And we keep coming back in something else next time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And how long does this go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on, this is going on, because you are eternal. According to your work, you are simply changing body. Therefore you should be educated how to stop this business, how to remain in our original, spiritual body. And that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Oh, I see. So if I gain Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I wouldn't have to have the threat of coming back as a dog or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Can you tell...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read that, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">janma karma ca me divyam<br class="calibre2"/>evam yo vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tyaktva dehaṁ punar janma<br class="calibre2"/>naiti mām eti so 'rjuna<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.9]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God says like that, that "Anyone who understands Me..." Because one cannot understand God with material speculation; that is not possible. When he comes onto the spiritual platform, then he gets the required brain to understand what is God, and if he understands God, what He is, then he does not get any more this material body, he goes back to home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And then he is with God forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he lives eternally, he lives eternally, no more change of body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Now, we've had two readings from your scriptures. Where did these scriptures comes from? Can you explain that briefly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is coming from Vedic literature, which is eternal. That is also eternal. But when there is creation, this creation, material creation, anything, material creation.... Just like this microphone is a material creation. So how to deal with it, there is some literature. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> How to deal with the microphone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is some literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's some literature explaining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, that's right, there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that literature comes along with the creation of the microphone. So similarly, the Vedic literatures comes immediately with the creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. So these scriptures have been in existence since we have, is what you're saying. What about other scriptures, other religions have got their scriptures. Do you believe, do you accept them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any scriptures, any.... Just like the same example. The literature issued along with the manufacturer of this microphone is bona fide. So if anyone follows that bona fide literature, he can deal with it. Otherwise, a bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Well, if we could take something which I believe you feel very strongly about, and that's some of the other Eastern cults and gurus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I cannot study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, can you explain to me why it is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far I know, they do not know anything. They simply come and bluff and cheat, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. What are the big differences that you seem to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difference is they are not following the original literature. They are manufacturing their own literature. That is the difference. Not authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I mean of the big differences I'm noticing is that you are stressing very much science and rational thinking, and they very often stress feeling, which doesn't seem to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When there is something wrong, you just consult the original literature, not any literature issued by a bogus man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Can you explain to me, then, the place of feeling in your religion. The place of emotions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our feeling is that we are dealing with the genuine thing, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And can..., if we can go on with that. Everybody seems to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa a lot of times during the day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the easiest process to become purified, especially given in this age. Because people are so dull that they cannot understand spiritual understanding very easily. So in order to purify him, this chanting is especially offered, that if he chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, then his brain becomes purified to understand spiritual things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> You say it's the simplest one. Are there presumably other chants that maybe you yourself use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think there is any other chanting. This is the only chanting. Where is other chanting? You can manufacture so many, but this is the only, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Let's see, what else? You founded this movement I think it was ten years ago, that's correct. Why was it that you left till you were so late in life before you founded it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I must be prepared, I must be bona fide to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And how do you become qualified? How did you become qualified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a spiritual process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And so you presumably had your teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Just as you now are teaching many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one is going to pass M.A. examination, he must be qualified. Not that all of a sudden one becomes M.A. He must be qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So what are you doing now? You've come to England for a brief stay. I gather you travel a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to guide my disciples and to see how they are doing things, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And do you do that, or travel around the world, don't you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but now I am getting old. So it is little difficult for me. Still I have to do and come and see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And that is your mission in life, is it, to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have established it, I want to see that it is not spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Can you tell me how you feel led, you know, how you are guided to do what you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, there are the books, just like I also told you, the literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So it's from your scriptures that you've learned that you've got to do this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we have got so many literatures. We are explaining in English. Guide is.... It is not manufactured. The guide is from the beginning. Simply one has to take that guidance, then everything's all right. And if we manufacture guidance, then it is spoiled. Just like in the literature of this microphone you say that this should be like this, this should be like this, number two should be by the side of number four. You cannot make any change. Then it is spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Now we've talked for some time concerning spiritual matters and the philosophy of Hare Kṛṣṇa. How does it affect the way people live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because he's suffering for want of this knowledge. He's misunderstanding himself that he is the body. Suppose if you misunderstand that you are coat and shirt, and so you sew and wash the coat and shirt. Will you be happy? Will you be happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> No, I won't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So similarly all these rascals, they are simply washing the coat and shirt. They have no information that what is there within the coat and shirt. They have no information. Ask anybody. All rascals will say, "Yes, I am Englishman, I am this coat," that's all. "I am thinking like an Englishman." That is shirt. And what you are, he cannot say. You are thinking, that is your mind. You are having this body, that is your body, but what you are? Who is thinking over this? Nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So by understanding...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Misunderstanding. The whole civilization, the modern civilization, is going on misunderstanding. <span class="Italic">Dehātma-buddhiḥ</span> -just like cats and dogs. Suppose if you become very proud, "I am Englishman. Why you have come here?" As the dogs bark, "Row! Row! Why you have come?" So where is the difference? What is the difference? He's thinking "I am dog," you are thinking "Englishman," I am thinking "Indian." There is no difference. So if we keep people in darkness of dog's mentality, and declare we are advanced in civilization, most misguiding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. And so when people are taught, they will then understand. But what I'd also like to know, how would it affect the way they live? In sort of purely..., the way they go about their life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see they are living, these boys are living. It is not very difficult. They are not dying, they are living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, I accept that completely, but I want to know what differences, if you could tell me basically, what difference it makes to their life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Difference is that if you accept this mode of life, it is very simplified, and no botheration, and you make your spiritual progress very easily. If you take otherwise, then it is difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But are you asking people, if they accept your teachings, to retreat from the world, like for instance, the people who are surrounding us now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are not retreated. What do you mean by retreat? I am using this microphone. Where is retreatment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Sorry, maybe retreat was the wrong word. But are you asking them, for instance, if I was to become a member of the movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are asking that use this microphone for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Not for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Sense gratification, pleasing the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Oh, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the.... The microphone is the same. And the politician can speak all nonsense, and the so-called scientist may speak all nonsense of going to the Mars planet, but we don't talk all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> If we could just put one more tape on it. No, if I can explain to you, the question I am trying to ask, which I'm finding difficulty to explain. Obviously, the members of the movement who are here have made a definite sort of decision that you've decided, they've decided, for instance, to dress differently, and they're dressing now in what would appear to be an Indian style. Is it necessary to do that, or could I carry on being a member of a radio station and still be a member of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That would be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Perhaps if I phrase it a bit differently. I gather that the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement also has some concern for areas of the world where there is suffering, physical suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got the only concern. Others, they are simply avoiding. They have no responsibility. They are talking all nonsense. We have got real responsibility. These people are being misguided, they are kept in darkness. Let us try to give them some enlightenment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, but apart from giving spiritual enlightenment, do you also..., are you also concerned for people's physical well-being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is automatically done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And how would you go about doing that? Would you help the sick people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if you have got a car to drive on. So naturally you take care of the car also. But not that you identify yourself, "I am this car." That is nonsense. They are doing that. They are taking too much care of the car, thinking that the car is one. He forgets that he is different from the car, he has got different business. He cannot eat the petrol and be satisfied. He has got different eating. But these rascals, they are thinking that "Petrol is also my eating." And they are drinking petrol and dying, that's all. Petrol is meant for the car, and for you there are so many fruits, flowers, milk. But if a man thinks that "I am the car, I must drink this petrol," then he is doomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. There's two things if I could perhaps bring up. One is a quote that we had.... I was given this literature by some of your people before I came, in which one of the things you say is that "Religion without a rational basis is just sentiment." Can you explain that to us, and the converse of it, which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like they, most religions, they say, "We believe." So what is this believe? You may believe something which is not naturally correct. Just like some of the Christian people, they say "We believe there is no soul of the animal." That is not correct. You have believed because you want to eat the animal. You have discovered philosophy, but that's not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> How do you know the animal has a soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can know also. What is the difference? How do you distinguish that the animal has no soul and the man has soul? How do you distinguish? How do you say the man has soul and the animal has no soul? How do you distinguish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I believe this Christian religion do it because their scriptures say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again you believe, don't believe, don't believe. When you say that the animal has no soul, but you believe or you know that man has soul. So what is the distinction between the man and the animal you find so that you say that the animal has no soul? What is your scientific conclusion? How do you say that animal has no soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> As far as the Christian faith is concerned, doesn't it base it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why are you bringing Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, I thought you quoted Christianity. But as far as the Christian faith is concerned, don't they quote their scriptures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is misleading. As soon as you say that "We Christians, we believe," then it is misbelief. It is not scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well how does it become scientific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientific because the animal eats, you eat. The animal sleeps, you sleep. The animals have sex, you have sex. The animal defends, you also defend. Then where is the difference between you and the animal? Why do you say there is no soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I can see that completely, but what I'm maybe querying is, for instance, the Christian scriptures would say that someone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't bring Christian scripture now. Simply you just try to understand, that animal eats, you eat, and the animal sleeps, you sleep. The animals have sex, you have got sex. He also defends when he's attacked, you also defend. Then if the behavior of a living being is the same, how do you say that the animal has no soul? Why do you say like that? Irresponsibly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see what you're getting at, but is that also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your answer, first of all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from your believing as Christian. As we are talking, as a scientist, how do you deny this animal has no soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But ultimately you're basing all your faith factually, aren't you, on your reasoning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. It is quite logic, that the animal can eat, you can eat; the animal can sleep, you can sleep. The animal can have sex, you can have sex; the animal can defend, you can defend; so why do you deny this poor animal soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, perhaps if I put my point perhaps a slightly different way, if, by your reasoning, if.... This is a hypothetical situation, but if you, by your reasoning, could imagine something that seemed contrary to the scriptures that you were reading earlier...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again scripture, why do you bring scripture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, I'm referring to your scripture, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not my scripture, it is common sense, talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, but everything that you, because in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, forget that everything, come to the common platform of understanding. The animal is eating, you are eating, the animal sleeping, you are sleeping. The animal is defending, you are defending. The animal is having sex, you have sex. The animal have children, you have got children. You have got a living place, they have got a living place. So why do you say.... If your body's cut, there is blood. If the animal body's cut, there is blood. So all the similarities are there. So why you deny one similarity? Analogy. Analogy means points of similarity. So this is logic. You have read logic? There is a chapter, analogy. Analogy means points of similarity. If the points of similarity are so many things, why one similarity should be avoided? That is not logic. That is not science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But if you take that logic and use it the other way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, there is no other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> No, if you say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are not on the basis of logic, then you are not rational.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, okay. But let's start from another hypothesis. If you say the animal has no soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> No, hang on, if you started off by saying that, then you'd have to say human beings would have no soul, wouldn't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you accept human being has soul, you have to accept animal has soul. If you accept animal has no soul, then there is no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well what proof have you got, then, that a human being has got a soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your business. We say everyone has soul. The animal has soul and the man has soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But if you're going to be rational, you've got surely to prove, you see you've got to prove that a human being has a soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is rational. Because we see all the points of similarity, analogy, therefore the human being has soul and the animal has soul, by points of similarity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, I can see the point you're trying to make about similarity, but what I'm asking is, what proof do you have that a human being has a soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, I have already begun. As soon as the soul is gone, what is the value of your this beautiful body? Who cares for this body? You throw it away, kick it out. And now, if I touch your hair, there will be fight. (laughter) Yes. That is the distinction. The soul is there and soul is not there. As soon as soul is not there, it has no value, useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. So what part then do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to study, that, this.... At the present moment people are so dull-headed, they are not taking the important point, that this body, one minute ago it was so important, and now it has no value. If you kick on his face, nobody will say. But they have no brain to understand what is that thing missing, that it has become so unimportant that within a minute.... They have no brain. The so-called scientists, philosophers, all dull-headed. It is very abominable condition of society. There is no man who is real brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Are you, sir, writing off all scientists because they've failed to understand the spiritual dimension in life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes, it is scientific, everything scientific. Science means knowledge, full knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But you were a chemist yourself, were you not, in secular life before you took up the position you have...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't require to become a very big chemist. Any common sense man can do it. Of course, I was chemist in my previous life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So presumably you think that that science is also important, even if scientists are being dull-headed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The important so far-not all-important. Not all-important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Can I come back to a question that is interesting me, and that is when we were differing a few minutes ago, you were saying don't bother, you know, don't bring the scriptures in, use common sense. But what part do the scriptures have in your religion? How important are they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our religion is science. As we, when we speak, that a child grows a boy, it is science, it is not religion. Every child grows to become a boy. Where is the question of religion? Every man dies. Where is the question of religion? And when a man dies, the body is useless. So where is the question of religion? It is science, it is science. Either you Christian or Hindu or Muslim, when you die your body's useless. This is science. You cannot say that "We are Christian. Now the body is dead. Now we don't consider it as dead. We believe it is not dead." No, it is dead. Either you are Christian or Hindu or Muslim, it is dead, it is useless. So when we speak, we speak on this basis, that the body is important-it doesn't matter whether it is Christian body or Hindu body or Muslim body-so long the soul is there. When the soul is not there, it is useless. It is applicable to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I think I'm beginning to get, if you could explain, a bit confused. What I'd like you to explain is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are trying to educate people on this basis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But that's, if I understand you correctly, you seem to be educating people on a purely scientific basis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So where does religion come into it at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion means also science. But they have taken religion as faith, "I believe." Religion means, actually, religion means.... Just like in the dictionary you find what is the religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Obeying the Supreme Person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Religion means to learn how to obey the supreme controller. That is religion. So you may be Christian, I may be Hindu, it doesn't matter. But we must accept there is a supreme controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Are you happy to carry on for a few more minutes perhaps?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I have that reference, in the dictionary. It says "Human recognition of superhuman controlling power..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "...and especially of a personal God entitled to obedience, and effect of such recognition on the conduct of mental attitude."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is religion. This is religion. So this religion is applicable to everyone, any human being. Why do you bring Christian or Hindu or Muslim, or...? Everyone has to accept that. That is real religion. And this is not religion, "We believe there is no soul of the animal." That is not religion. That is most unscientific. That is not religion. Religion means scientific understanding of the supreme controller. So now if you accept the supreme controller, then if you violate something, you must be punished. Immediately you have to accept. As soon as you accept there is supreme controller, so immediately as you violate the laws of the supreme controller, immediately you are punished. That is nature's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Can we, can you say a bit more of that, just for the tape? You were saying that religion is obeying the supreme controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes! Religion means to understand the supreme controller and obey. That's all. Just like good citizen means he understands the government and obeys the laws of government. That's all. Good citizens. What is the difference between bad citizen and good citizen? The bad citizen means he doesn't care for the government-"Ah, I don't care for"-that is bad citizen. That is irreligious. If you are bad citizen, then you are irreligious. If you are good citizen, then you are religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Would you..., in your opinion, is it impossible for somebody to be a scientist and not to believe in God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless he's a rascal, he cannot say that. Scientifically, you have to accept God. You cannot deny God. Just like the example I have given sometimes, just like you see there are so many living entities, beginning from grass, or anything. There are so many living entities coming out of the material elements. Some of them are coming from water, some of them coming from land, some of them coming from air.... [break] There is life in fire also. So the material nature is giving birth to so many living entities. So if the material nature is the mother and all these living entities are children, then where is the father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I don't know. The father is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There. You must know there must be father. I may know, not know him, but without father the children cannot be brought into existence. This is science. First of all, try to understand this. The mother is there, the children are there. So there must be father. This is scientific. So who is that rascal scientist who can say "No, there is no father"? Then he's not a scientist, he's a rascal. How you can deny the existence of father? You may not see him or may see Him, it doesn't matter. There must be father. This simple understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So you completely write off anybody who says that there should be a step of faith. And would you, in other words...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No faith! It is fact!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So you would say that science can prove that God exists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, here is proof. Here is the proof, that there is children. Children are children; there is mother; so there must be father. This is proof. It doesn't require much proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Can you tell me what you believe to be the meaning of life, why do we exist in the first place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meaning of life means to enjoy, but we are in a different platform of life. Therefore we are suffering instead of enjoying. But if you come to the real platform, then you enjoy. Because here we see struggle for existence, everyone is struggling, but what is the aim? For enjoyment of life. Therefore life means enjoyment. But at the present moment our life is not enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> At the present moment, our life is not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our life is not enjoyment-suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Suffering, hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, do you admit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> You are saying at the present moment we are all suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, I would agree with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then the question should be, "I want to enjoy. Why I am suffering?" Then you will have to mold your real life.... Then you'll enjoy. And that is spiritual knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see. Can you explain to me, then, perhaps finally, just some of the stages you go through in this spiritual life. Sort of, from somebody being a new devotee to Hare Kṛṣṇa, what are the mental or the spiritual stages you go through?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As they follow the principles, they realize that "Yes, I am advancing," Otherwise, why they should stick? They are also educated, they are young men, and they are coming from respectable family. They are not dull-headed dogs. So why they are sticking to this principle unless they feel, "Yes, I am making progress"? Just like you are hungry, and if you are given some foodstuff, you eat the.... With every morsel of food you feel, "Yes, my hunger is satisfied. I am feeling strength, I must go on till I am fully satisfied." It is like that. It doesn't require certificate from others. He'll feel himself, "Yes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, what I'm asking you, saying, maybe if you could explain to me how you personally, the different feelings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We simply suggest that you follow this method and you'll advance. And if anyone follows, he advances, that's all. Our, I am teacher, my business is to give them direction. So if they follow the direction, their business is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, but perhaps you could explain to me the different feelings that you've gone through in your life. Is that possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone-why I, you?-everyone. So long one is in ignorance, there are different feelings. When one is in knowledge, that is permanently. Suppose a man was in ignorance, he was committing a theft and he suffered. And now when he has come to knowledge, that "This business is not good," he does not any more steal and does not suffer. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But there must be different stages that you go through, is that not correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, different stages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Can you tell me from your own experience some of these different stages you've been through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, first stage is that you are inquisitively trying to understand. This is the first stage. This is called <span class="Italic">śraddha,</span> that you have got some faith, "What is this movement? Let me study." This is the beginning. Then, if you are serious, then those who are cultivating this knowledge, you mix with them, try to understand how they are feeling. Then you'll feel, "Why not become one of them?" Then when you become one of them, then all your misgivings go away. And then you become more faithful and you, then you get a taste. Why these boys are not going to see the cinema? They can go-other boys are going. They never ask me. Neither they would like to see even. They hate. Their taste is different. Why they do not eat meat, go to the restaurant? Their taste has changed. In this way you make progress. Firm faith, taste is changed, then God-realization, then love of Godhead, the perfection. That is wanted, love of Godhead. That is first-class religion. Not that ritualistic ceremony, "I believe," "This belief." That is not religion; that is cheating. Really when you develop your love for God, that is perfection of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Perhaps finally, then, I could ask you, do you ever have any doubts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I have doubts, how I am preaching? That means I am cheating. And how I am writing so many books? Do you think a man with doubt can produce, in doubtful condition, he can produce so many books? (devotees quietly laughing) Do you think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, I don't know, I just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, you should know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> So you never doubt any of this, anything at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> That you have found the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Utsāhān dhairyāt niścayād.</span> Find out this verse.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"There are six principles favorable to the execution of pure devotional service: (1) being enthusiastic, (2) endeavoring with confidence, (3) being patient, (4) acting according to regulative principles (such as <span class="Italic">śravanaṁ kīrtanam viṣṇoḥ smaranam [SB </span>7.5.23]-hearing, chanting and remembering Kṛṣṇa), (5) abandoning the association of nondevotees, and (6) following in the footsteps of the previous <span class="Italic">acaryas.</span> These six principles undoubtedly assure the complete success of pure devotional service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And you are sure this is the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Thank you very much for talking to me. It's been a pleasure talking to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Give him <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is a, just a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> It's lovely. Do I eat it with a spoon? (laughs) How's the normal way to eat it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You can eat it with a spoon, it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, there is.... Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's no rule for taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> What's it made of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is called <span class="Italic">halava.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Farina.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Farina and <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> it's cooked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Clarified butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Most of our preparations are made from milk products. Therefore we are so much fond of cow protection. It gives the basic principle of palatable foodstuff. But these people, they do not know. They simply cut the throat of the cow and boil it and with salt. (laughter) They do not know how to keep the cow and take milk from it and prepare hundreds and thousands of nice preparations. That is a lack of civilization. Just like all the, what is called, aborigines, they find an animal, kill it and eat. They do not how to utilize the animals. Most aboriginal. We keep cows, we take milk, and from milk we make yogurt, we make <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> and from <span class="Italic">ghee</span> we prepare so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> What do you do with a cow when it dies? Do you just bury it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If the cow-eaters can come and take it free of charge. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, let me know, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can get the skin free of charges. In India still, there is a class, they, when the cow dies, they are called, they are called <span class="Italic">chamar.</span> So he comes, take away the animal, dead animal, and they eat the flesh and take the skin, make shoes. They get all, everything free. There is no question of going to the butcher's place to purchase. So this much patience they have got, that "We want to eat this cow. All right, let us wait till her death." No, immediately. Just see, what a civilization. And cow is giving milk, she is mother. Killing the mother. Do you think it is civilization? Mother who has given you milk in your childhood, and maintained your life, and because she is old, cutting throat. Is that good civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Seems silly, doesn't it. Umm, I think are you keeping cows here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. We have about twelve cows here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got many farms all over the world. They are living very happy. Have you got some pictures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Of the cows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, of our farms, farmland. Leading very simple life, in your country, in, I mean to say, America, Europe. Very simple life. Food grains and milk. You can prepare hundreds of nice preparations, full of vitamins, nutritious. And they do not know how to live civilized life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Here are some nice pictures here. Some of our cows, you see this small one. And here's one of our farms in West Virginia in America. There's over a hundred and fifty cows in this farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Do you find the English weather cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I am old man, I'm not a young blood like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> And you think it's more because of your age, I mean you've got used to a colder climate than India, have you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are accustomed to tropical climate. This.... Heat does not disturb us, but cold disturbs us. We can tolerate extreme heat, 120 degrees, but we cannot tolerate fifty degree cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> That's cold. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> That was very good. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why young men are attracted to, they inquire? Why young men are attracted in this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are receptive. Young man is blank slate. They are not sophisticated. Therefore they receive very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Mind is more open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Mind is open. That is.... And they are not so sinful, because they are young.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not quite so defeated by material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Here's some more pictures of our farms. We have about eighteen farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, we have a whole film that shows this farming project; it's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You come here every Sunday. You come here every Sunday, take our, this <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I'd very much like if I could sometime in the future perhaps to come and interview some of the people who are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come and see, he's the president, he can see you. He's the more command. You can see him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> That would be possible if sometime I could just spend the day up here and talk to some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can live here comfortably, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> If you like, you can spend the whole day with us, you can stay overnight, we have a guest room, very comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday George Harrison came, he stayed with me for whole day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Sorry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> George Harrison came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Yes, I know, I'd like to have met the two of you together. It should have been very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came yesterday and lived with us the whole day. He has given us this house, George Harrison, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Actually, it's very good, isn't it. It's a lovely house, isn't it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Very nice house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> How do you find it in winter? Do you find it difficult coping then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No. I do, because I'm from the desert, but our British boys of course appreciate it. When it gets over 75 they immediately become prostrated with the heat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Which desert are you from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, from California desert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Oh, I see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall request you, you are young man, just try to study our philosophy. And as you are journalist, try to do some good to the people. That is your duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Well, certainly we're trying to present both other people's views and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't take it as a sectarian religious system. It is very scientific understanding for spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But, ah, "Beware of the undefeatable reasoning and logic of the Hare Kṛṣṇas, who will steal away your children." (laughs) Because we argue so nicely because Śrīla Prabhupāda has trained us up very perfectly, because he also is the perfect teacher of this. Therefore the students can learn that way. So when we argue people become afraid, because it makes so much sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They accuse me, "kidnapper of children." But what is my kidnapping method? The young men, they understand philosophy. What I can do, kidnap them? I have no money, I have no strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But it exists purely as a charity, isn't that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, purely nonprofit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Which must make it difficult sometimes, doesn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, it's done out of love. So it is not at all difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No one requires any payment. The only payment is the fulfillment that they are experiencing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> But how about the electricity board and people like that? I mean, where do you get the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Kṛṣṇa gives us the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we have no scarcity of money. We are selling our books daily, sixty thousand dollars' worth. So we have got sufficient income to maintain the whole institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No one takes any personal benefit. All the money is used for the furtherance of our principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Besides that, when we require a nice house, somebody gives. Just like George has given us. Similarly, we have got many houses. One boy, his name is Alfred Ford, he's the great-grandson of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford. He has given us two, three very nice properties. So the money, there is no scarcity, and Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. If Kṛṣṇa dictates "Give him this," he'll give, that's all. And that is being happening actually. Within ten years nobody can expect to construct a house like this in a city like London. Is it possible? Even if he is a very big businessman. Not only one, there are so many. It is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy. (<span class="Italic">kirtana</span> in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> I don't know. Cost a lot, wouldn't it. Is this worship that's taking place downstairs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, go down and see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see the Deity, yes, go and see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Robinson:</span> Thank you very much, pleasure to meet you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much for your coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Mike Robinson leaves) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually he was quite intelligent, he was asking good questions because he was following the conversation. He was better than most of the interviewers, anyway. You're very expert. (laughter) You capture them and then you guide what they're going to say. It's perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I was noticing that, that when you finish speaking with somebody, although he's bewildered, all of a sudden he understands, and he becomes amazed. I mean that happens with me also. It's just, it's the most fantastic technique. You're so patient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like that man from the Associated Press. You forced him to stay on those two analogies until he understood. For ten minutes you explained that, the car and the driver, until it finally got through to him. Then when he finally had some realization of it, then you again gave him another analogy about breaking the bricks in the prison. And again you forced him to stay on the same subject matter. And he..., you do it in such a way that they think that they're asking very good questions from their own intelligence. Actually, you've already captured them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's like taming wild animals. The perfect animal trainer. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that breaking the bricks is the business. I said the sooner you give up this, then you are happy. <span class="Italic">Karmīs,</span> the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> want this, breaking the bricks. They think this is civilization. Brick, more brick, and bring more bricks and break it. That is civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And then when we tell them that this is not your business, they ask us, "Why aren't you breaking bricks?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are punished. You are being punished in this way. Actually, I saw in New York, big, big building, they are breaking, again, another skyscraper. "No, I have business. Breaking the bricks," that's all. They think this is very good business. Once constructed, again break it. As child, children, they make a sand house and break it again. This is the occupation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But there's nothing else to do for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the difficulty. Now see, there is no soul. Why no soul? How foolish it is. "We believe." You believe something nonsense, it has to be accepted? Where is the difference of analogy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (laughs) They have to give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Analogy, the more the points of similarities are there, it is perfect. That is the logical conclusion. Everything is there similar, why you should deny the other? How rascaldom it is. Common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He was a little bit confused because first of all you quoted <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> said everything was from <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Then again you said "Forget the <span class="Italic">śāstra;</span> this is logic." (laughter) He couldn't figure out how they both came into play. And then at the end you said that religion is logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is religion. If you have to accept the supreme authority, then as soon as you violate you are punishable. Very common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's because they're so conditioned by this man-made religion. They think that the scriptures they read is something that's made up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, it's a belief that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they are suitable, they make. But he cannot control over the supreme controller. They have no brain. And they are going on under the name of religion. Just see. All these rascals. Therefore they're all cheating. If you believe in the supreme controller, how you can change whimsically the law given by the supreme controller?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you actually know God, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes, that means it is fictitious. You don't believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We have to get you on every radio in the world, Prabhupāda. We just have to put you on the radio everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do it, I give you the ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, everything you say is so wonderful. We have to put you on the radio. These people, they have no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, thing is that I say all these things because I always think of this. I always think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you don't forget Kṛṣṇa, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you always think how to talk with these demonic people. Then Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the most difficult welfare work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They don't want it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not difficult, it is easiest. But this rascal will not take the easiest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have made it difficult. Accept the supreme controller, everything is clear. Accept the father, everything is clear. There is mother, there is children, no father. How rascal they have made. How it can be? No experience, and still they will persist, "No father." Can you show me the father? What is nonsense, if you do not see the father, it does not mean that there is no father? Father must be there. You may not have seen, that is different thing. And you can see the father because the father is maintaining the family order. Therefore there is father. From this simple analogy. Just like father gives money in the hand of the mother and she maintains the children comforts. Similarly, whatever comforts we are getting, from the nature's gift, you say that is arrangement of the father. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣena prakṛtiḥ sūyate sacarācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> Clearly said. Father gives order, "Nature, do this way, do this way. He's disobeying, then punish him like this, that's all. Don't give him anything. Punish him." Just like nature is not supplying water. The order of Kṛṣṇa, "Let them suffer for some time." This is going on. You cannot check it, father's order. Common sense. How they can deny the supreme father? Dull-headed fools. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Any fruits you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have some grapes. Shall I get them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grapes, sometimes they are sour. What other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pears, apples, bananas, watermelon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Banana is very good. And give me apples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pear also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'll try the grapes. If they are not sour, I'll bring some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you keep that.... [break] They are opening hospital for giving medicine to the shirt and coat, and where is the man's medicine? Washing the shirt and coat, laundry work. They do not know that the man within the shirt and coat requires different treatment, different, he has got different necessities, different life. If I simply wash the shirt and coat, does it mean the man is happy? They have no common sense even. "Yes, we are supplying petrol to the car. It must drive." "Well, sir, to give good to the driver who will drive?" "Doesn't require, petrol is there." That's all. This is their intelligence. They are supplying petrol. Will the driver eat, drink petrol? They have no knowledge. He requires spiritual food. And these rascals, they do not know it. They'll say that petrol is sufficient both for the car and the driver. This is their intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They are always maddened by lusty desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Very, very risky civilization. Keeping the whole human society in darkness. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ bahir-artha-māninaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> By material adjustment they are thinking that "Everything we will enjoy."(?) There are two different things, matter and spirit. The spirit requires spiritual food. (sound of water pouring, scraping noise, cracking noises)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...this is going to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep in the right place. Keep.... Yes. They are thinking like it is another religious system, like Christianity. So.... If they are so fools, they are giving up one system and coming to another system? Why they should come at all? There is no necessity. And what advantage I am giving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In fact, quite a few disadvantages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You say we cannot eat meat, have sex life. Be right back. (end)</div>
