<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did Prabhupāda say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda wants to do here. He's going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is he going to do it here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda's requesting here. He said it's better if we do it here. So he said, "Make all the arrangements necessary."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He wants to bring the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> to inaugurate the Bombay temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we shall consider later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 'Cause we already told these South Indian <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them may go also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Now stop talking. (long pause) You have given him ten rupees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> To that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. He gave ten rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Tamāla gave him ten rupees?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were reading something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. He's... [break] Yesterday I spent the day in Delhi, and I opened an account with the Punjab Bank in the name of Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust. And we also gave them a letter that the interest from the ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> sixty thousand should go into that Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity account. And I took the original trust of the new trust, the original deed, and I made some photocopies and got them notarized by notary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Photocopy of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Of the trust deed forming the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust. And then I bought a copy of the income tax act, because there's some provision that if funds are used to restore some ancient place of worship or some place of worship which is famous in a particular state, then that is exempt from income tax. So I think that this fits in with the aims and objects of this new trust. So we should be able to get tax exemption for that. I spoke to Bombay to see how things were doing, and Gopāla Kṛṣṇa said that everything is going nice, and he's coming here on Friday, after two days. So I told him that your condition was very serious and that I wanted to stay here for a little longer. So he said that was okay. I confirmed with Yaśodānandana Swami's assistant that he sent the letter to the South Indian <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> to confirm that they can come on the dates which we have fixed. So we're waiting to hear that reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take some <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> from here. Balaram...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll chant <span class="Italic">Veda-mantra</span> very nice</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Uh-huh. We can have these <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and also the South Indian <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? So a letter came. One boy wrote me a letter. When I was going to go to China a while ago, before you told me not to, this boy was working with me. And his name is Jita-rati. So he went to China, and he's written a report. Should I read it to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "My dear Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and Dhṛṣṭadyumna Swami: Please accept my most humble obeisances unto your feet. All glories to our beloved spiritual master Śrīla Prabhupāda. May Lord Kṛṣṇa, if He so desires, please cure Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'm writing this letter as a brief report on the recent events as a result of my trip to Kwangchow, Canton China. I arrived on October 16th. Business-attended the Trade Fair but signed no contracts as all the prices were far too high. Research on some items may result in future business. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana-</span>our real business: I gave two Chinese <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> to the Chungshan University, or Dr. Sun Yatsen University as it is called now, in Canton. They were accepted by the administration with assurance of being delivered to the appropriate departments. I inquired from the liaison office how to visit the university. They said it must be prearranged, but they did not know how. From past experience..." This boy had gone to China once before, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He's a Canadian. He says, "From past experience..." He's one of your disciples. "From past experience, because of limited time, I decided to just go, although warned not to. I walked past the guard's house at the gate of the university, hoping not to be seen. After I got forty to fifty yards, when a woman came running after me yelling in Chinese. I finally turned to her and said, 'No, it is all right,' and smiled and I kept walking on. She retreated, by Kṛṣṇa's grace, and I went on to the first building, where I saw some books through the windows. As I approached the front door, the first person I met was a middle-aged woman who spoke good English. She was a biology teacher, and we discussed the life principle as she took me to the history department and then reception. There, with two other Chinese persons, we discussed Chinese politics, and I explained the natural social body, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span>" He was discussing <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> with them. "However, as they began to understand how much sense it made, they said I had better talk to the people of the political philosophy but were unwilling to arrange it, and I was unable to also. They admitted to still having a class society in China, but the goal was to have no classes, with the means of production so arranged that everyone could have what they wanted. Such demons. They accept Marx, Lenin and Mao as absolute authority and plan to spread this perfect social system, as they call it, all over the world. I gave one <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> to the main public library. They accepted when they found out that I was a Canadian and thanked me very much. Then, on October 25th, with saffron <span class="Italic">dhotī</span> and Chinese cymbals, I went out on the main street in Kwangchow in the evening, chanting the holy name." This is in China, Śrīla Prabhupāda. "At first there were many suspicious looks, but in a few minutes I had a large crowd following me. Soon the children were running in front, with some of them dancing. I also began to dance, and a loud uproar ensued from the audience. The crowd grew larger and extended out into the road, where the buses began to honk their horns. Just then a cymbal fell from the string to the ground. As I picked it up and repaired it, the crowd came very close all around and tightly crowded. I chanted loudly, 'Hare Kṛṣṇa,' and heard one 'Kṛṣṇa,' in return. I responded with 'Kṛṣ-ṇa' loudly, and three or four answered. Soon I had about twenty responding to the chant, but decided to go on, as the crowd was getting too big. A few minutes later a man broke through the crowd and grabbed my arm and motioned me to stop. I continued, and soon another grabbed the other arm and pulled me into a shop, closed the doors and offered me a seat. The crowd responded with an uproar and banged on the doors for a little while. I had to wait about fifteen minutes until a person came who spoke English. He told me I was causing interference with traffic, and soon after they let me go. I did not go out again as I did not want to agitate them too far. I had previously chanted in a bus and showed the people pictures of Kṛṣṇa. It was very ecstatic. I have been told since then that the incidents would be heard of by nearly everyone in Kwangchow as a conversation topic. Perhaps the name of Kṛṣṇa will also be repeated many times by many people..." [break] <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So China has sacrificed everything. What is their aim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In China? Their aim... They say that their aim is to establish a classless society where everyone gets everything that they require. Economic aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What aim? Low-class men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their entire outlook is an economic one. They have no... They don't feel that there's any importance to culture or any of the finer sentiments except that they may further the economic consideration. Politically also, their political understanding is also ultimately directed for economics. Any of their political dealings with other countries are all ultimately to establish this economic Communism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How human society is falling down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From the definition given in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they don't classify as human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't try for China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You had said that before a few times also. They are completely restricted in every respect. Whereas in other..., East European countries and in Russia, the professors may read various types of literature, in China they're not allowed to do that. And if they are ever caught doing that, they immediately are sentenced to prison and they lose everything. The difference in China as opposed to Russia is that in China every few years all the professors are made to be farmers. And also the workers in the factories and the farmers are the predominate controllers of the universities. They are not at all interested in culture or in higher education. Their whole purpose even for the universities is to train up loyal Chinese citizens. Everything is for that end. So no cultural interest would ever be tolerated on the part of the authorities there. And the people are so much controlled by these authorities that they would lose everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? You said before that you..., that it is said that you were poisoned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. These kind of symptoms are seen when a man is poisoned. He said like that, not that I am poisoned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did anyone tell you that, or you just know it from before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I read something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ah, I see. That's why actually we cannot allow anyone else to cook for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayapatāka Mahārāja was telling that one <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> Śaṅkarācārya, of the Śaṅkarācārya line-this was a while ago-he was poisoned to death. Since that time, none of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> or the gurus of the Śaṅkarācārya line will ever take any food cooked except by their own men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My Guru Mahārāja also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. You, of course, have been so merciful that sometimes you would take <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> cooked by so many different people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be stopped. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are you feeling any pain, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. (pause) Urine bottle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Urine? You want to try for it? Okay. Should we again continue some <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Okay. (Haṁsadūta leads <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Fifty, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "...your letter with enclosures as on reverse. Kindly accept yourself and convey my humble obeisances to my ailing father, and Lord Kṛṣṇa will protect and we have nothing to worry about. Without touching details right now, as desired by you, I beg to submit that a meaningful 'further discussion...' " Remember, I had mentioned to him that we could have a further discussion if we had any questions, "...that a meaningful 'further discussion' could be ensued between us on the subject of settlement upon receipt of a confirmatory letter from the bank concerned either to you or to me directly as to the scheme purported to have been devised by ISKCON. No discussion, perhaps you will agree, without bank's letter, will serve any purpose towards a settlement. If it is a fait accompli, I feel sure the bank's letter describing the arrangements in so many words might bear salutary effect on our further discussions as propounded by your good self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's one point about... Actually, I simply asked him for the name of his bank and the bank account, but he doesn't seem to want to give that at this point. Seems to have some other idea. Very legally worded letter. "3) Panchashil. I do not stay there, albeit my daily visits. Once I have read somewhere, not the copy sent by you, this draft conveyance, and this is a bunkum." He calls it a bunkum. Are you familiar with that word, Śrīla Prabhupāda? I think it means like a hoax or something. "The wordings are incoherent and contradictory. The assigners, promoters, are described as overlord. The lessers, superlord, and assignees, purchasers, have been reduced to a transient resident, if not fugitive debtor. In my opinion, causes are there for criminal prosecution against the promoters. Without capable and competent lawyers' help, this legal matter should not be handled. Until then, keep it in abeyance. Your all the papers as mentioned..." I sent him a copy of the scheme, Śrīla Prabhupāda, as well as a copy of the draft... "All of your papers, as mentioned, are sent herewith back to you." He didn't choose to keep them. "While awaiting the bank's comments, I beg to remain respectfully yours, M.M. De." He says, "The enclosures are sent under ordinary post to avoid heavy postage in this cover." He decided to send them by a separate post because it would have been a few extra paisa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless the bank confirms, he does not take it seriously. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's more or less what he's suggesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let the bank confirm. What is the harm? Hm? The bank is not going to confirm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, the bank will do whatever we ask them to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let them confirm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If he gives us the bank name and the account of his, then by getting the first monthly installment, then automatically it's confirmed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think you should send him Panchashil. If the bank can send the money, Panchashil?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To Panchashil. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they suppose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, I personally don't feel at this point... Frankly speaking, I don't think that this reply on his part is very good. I don't think it's proper. He's speaking about a settlement. First of all there is no settlement. The whole legal way in which he's worded this letter indicates to me that he's not taking things in a very... Seems to me he has some motives. He has no reason to doubt this scheme. That's my point. And if he's thinking that he has some kind of rights... [break] ...offices. They're very pleased. And they were especially pleased to get these fixed deposits. Immediately we gave them this six <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> fixed deposits, they were very happy with this. They've got about something like 350 accounts already from outsiders within a month or two. They're very, very pleased. They feel that this will become a full branch very quickly, and they have a great amount of space, and they're not at all sorry about the price that they're paying. And it's a good income for our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nearly ten thousand rupees a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why ten thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think it's quite ten thousand. I think it's less. Eight or nine thousand. Four rupees....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is... Plus interest of the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Plus interest of the... Of which money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The deposit money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fixed deposit money. Well, of course, but that we would have gotten anywhere. But from the point of view of rent it is certainly very substantial rent. That was your scheme, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa is giving us all facility. Utilize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I especially like that bank, because when you come in, in the center of the wall, instead of seeing some old grumpy-looking bank president, we see Your Divine Grace's effulgent picture, and it says, right under your picture-it's a very big picture-it says "I.O.B. Welcomes You." It's very nicely done. And in each of the teller's counters, each of the cashier's counters, there's a little picture of Rādhā-Rāsabihārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's very nicely done. People who go there bank with confidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are getting benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It was the proper bank to have there. And because it's right on the ground floor and just near the entrance of the gate, people don't mind coming from the outside. And I've noticed people, after they come and do their banking business, they go for <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe our Deity will get known that people who bank in our bank, they get more money. (laughs) I think the I.O.B. is thinking like that, that to be connected with the Deity is very auspicious, so they're accentuating the involvement with ISKCON and Your Divine Grace and Rādhā-Rasabehari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We had no idea how that Hare Krishna Land would ever be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It was a jungle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's what we were thinking. "Why does Prabhupāda want us to live in a jungle?" So far away. Nothing there but mosquitoes, and so many rats. We thought, "Who will come there?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now when we construct the other building, further down, it will be (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Godown will be on the ground floor, and residences and Gurukula on the other floors. The only problem is that it's such a good place that now we can't get the residents to move out of those other buildings. They say, "Why should we move? Now we have a temple. There'll be a Gurukula. There's a bank." It's very hard to get them out. Of course, we don't care if they stay, if they're nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gradually they'll be devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Either they'll be devotees or they'll be driven out by the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> The upper floor of each of those buildings has also increased the utilization of those buildings. That was also your scheme, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was my scheme, but we have not given full freedom to the tenant, or controllment(?).</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We will all sit down and discuss the different arrangements that have to be made, plans that have to be made. It's a very nice idea. Real <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mm. You have tried doctor, <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> medicine, everything. Everything has failed. Now suppose I am taking the risk of death, what is wrong? When the..., I am dead you go India, within India, you go and bring the body either in Māyāpura or Vṛndāvana. Māyāpura the land is already there. Vṛndāvana I think on the gate side, that's all. That's wherever you like you'll do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you commented that when Ṭhākura Bhaktivinoda was put on the gate side that that was no way to respect a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> So then doesn't seem proper to put you by the gate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not by the gate. There is ample land. Or in Māyāpura, that will be very nice. Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> assures that by taking little milk frequently during the day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will take milk. Milk is available everywhere. (laughter) I shall take little milk and sleep, that's all. If I live, that's all right. If I don't live, that doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Very nice program. We can all accompany you at different times of the month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not very many, but you can come and go back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Which holy places you would like to visit, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India is full of holy places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-līlā, Mahāprabhu-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And gradually you go to Māyāpura. Is someone here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He has heard everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> By you going to the holy places, you will purify the holy places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two things, life or death. So if I die where is the wrong? And if there is death, that is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> For you Śrīla Prabhupāda, to be alive or to die is no different because you are in the transcendental position, but for us when you leave the body then we are bereft of your association. So for us it is very unfortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then live by my words, by my training. Mm. (pause) So you like this idea? Mm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I liked it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dharaṇa:</span> It's Haṁsadūta Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (pause) Most places you beg from the local place and subsist, otherwise purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> You are very famous, Śrīla Prabhupāda, wherever you go there will be crowds of people to have your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they will see me, I have no objection. I want little milk from them, that's all. (pause) So far my presence is required (for) management, I think I have bequeathed, properly you can manage. Hm. It is to be admitted failure, the so-called medical treatment, failure. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I'll be back to say that you defy all medical laws. Sometimes you become very weak and sometimes you become immediately strong. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I think this is a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Girirāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Because, I mean, I don't have any faith in the doctors or their treatments because they're never working and ultimately it depends on Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. He can exercise His will in any condition and you know, as you say, that if you go out and if you recover then it's very good. And even otherwise, I mean if that is the decision of Lord Kṛṣṇa, then this is a very glorious way. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All seriously consider this submission and let me go. (end)</div>
