<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...count how you got this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa sent these from Los Angeles three years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> They're staying in closet. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who will paint?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Cintāmaṇi will paint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So take note. So eyes are all right. Eyes are all right. It is all right. Simply you have to, all the hairs to make black up to the...It is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then His hands should be red.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> What about this? She's holding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She holds the sari, skirt. Give me some cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Some cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the... Do it. And this hand is betel nut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Betel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> What color should it be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Green.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Green.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Green. Green. In dancing mood, She is offering a betel nut to Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa is dancing and playing with flute. So this should be white and red. These are petals. It should be red. And this should be white. And a little black line. Is that all right? Then this. They should be all red. And the nails should be white, nails.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hands red and nails, yes, you can make white. You can... Go on. So any other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> I made wigs, but maybe they are too long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> I made hair. But I don't know how long it should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can see Kṛṣṇa's picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Picture of Kṛṣṇa? Is His hair curly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Curling, (indistinct) black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Is this too long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Too long. This is also too long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Too long. How long should it be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It should not come below, Rādhārāṇī, the waist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Oh. And Kṛṣṇa's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Kṛṣṇa's should be up to the neck.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Thank you. Kṛṣṇa wears <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> like we do? Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Rādhārāṇī only red spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> We have some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any other questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Since we are going to have three altars, then we should also have three different plates, a different plate for each altar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is already known to you. Bhānu knows very well. You have seen in Los Angeles. Why three plates? If you can spare more plates for each, that will be nice. Just like one for Rādhā and for Kṛṣṇa, one for Jagannātha, one for Balarāma, one for Subhadrā, one for guru, one for Gaurāṅga, Pañca-tattva, five. If you can increase, you can manage, that is nice. Otherwise one plate to guru is sufficient. If you cannot spare. If you can spare, you can increase as many plates as you can. Otherwise one plate to guru is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> On <span class="Italic">ekādaśī,</span> we can offer the Deity grains?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. But not guru. <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> observed by <span class="Italic">jīva-tattva,</span> not by <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-tattva.</span> We are fasting for clearing our material disease, but Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Caitanya Mahāprabhu also may not be offered grains because He is playing the part of a devotee. Only Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Jagannātha can be offered grains. Otherwise, Guru-Gaurāṅga, no. And the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> should not be taken by anyone. It should be kept for next day. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> I tried to make a flute for Kṛṣṇa because He doesn't have a flute. Is that okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> We will order one flute from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why India? You can get it here. Any goldsmith can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> In the morning the Deity should be woken up not before five? The Deities should be woken up at five in the morning? Some temples it is 4:30, some temples five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just one and a half hours before sunrise. If the sunrise varies, then the waking time also should vary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> So according to season, we should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The rule is that one and a half hours before sunrise. So that you have to make, when the sunrise, then just one and a half hour before, <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> So that's when the <span class="Italic">ārati</span> begins, when the curtains are opened and we start offering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> One and a half hours before sunrise is when the <span class="Italic">ārati</span> begins. Then you wake them up before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Just waking, <span class="Italic">ārati</span> begins. And you can offer something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> We should offer the plate after the <span class="Italic">ārati?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> After.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is it all right for the Deities' hair to show?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sometimes, at some temples, the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities, sometimes Their hair shows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. Like Rādhārāṇī's hair is down in front. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter. That is for beauty, as it is possible. Better keep it that side. Just like Rādhārāṇī's hair... There is picture. That <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they have got their hair that side. Rādhārāṇī is also one of the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> but she is the dearmost <span class="Italic">gopī.</span> That's all. Otherwise, she is also <span class="Italic">gopī.</span> Then? What else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Bhānu had a question about something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> Does evening <span class="Italic">ārati</span> vary according to the sunset? Or it is just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Sunset.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And how many full <span class="Italic">āratis</span> should we perform, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three main: <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati, bhoga-ārati</span> and <span class="Italic">sandhya-ārati.</span> These are main. Then you can offer <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati</span> before going to bed. <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati.</span> And these four, and <span class="Italic">dhūpa-ārati</span> just after lighting, or before lighting. Then, after rest in afternoon, <span class="Italic">dhūpa-ārati.</span> After dressing, <span class="Italic">dhūpa-ārati.</span> So two, three <span class="Italic">dhūpa-ārati,</span> and three, four full <span class="Italic">āratis.</span> Three must be, and four also, four, full <span class="Italic">āratis.</span> And <span class="Italic">dhūpa-ārati</span> at least three, four. In this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> The full <span class="Italic">ārati</span> will be in the morning, <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> there will be the noon <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> supposed to be one in the evening. When should the other full <span class="Italic">ārati</span> be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the Deities are going to bed. Before going to bed. Yes. <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati,</span> it is called <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati.</span> <span class="Italic">Sundara-ārati,</span> <span class="Italic">bhoga-ārati,</span> <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span> You write down. <span class="Italic">Maṅgala-ārati</span> early in the morning, <span class="Italic">bhoga-ārati</span> at noon, offering <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then <span class="Italic">sundara-ārati</span> just after half an hour or one hour sunset, then <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> One hour after sunset?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One hour or half an hour. It must be dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh, the <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Sundara-ārati.</span> <span class="Italic">Sundara-ārati</span> must be as soon as it is dark. And then <span class="Italic">śayana-ārati.</span> <span class="Italic">Śayana-ārati.</span> <span class="Italic">Śayana</span> means going to bed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> What time should the <span class="Italic">śayana...</span> The time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> Should the Deities be offered grains for breakfast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Grains...Grains only <span class="Italic">bhoga-ārati</span> and at night... <span class="Italic">Purī</span> also grain. It is also grain. And during daytime, <span class="Italic">cāpāṭī,</span> rice, dahl, like that. Breakfast, fruits, milk, sweets, breakfast. And early, <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> condensed milk. And breakfast, butter, sugar candy, casein. You are calling Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme. You must offer Him nice things. Not a poor man gets like Him. He's the richest man. If a poor man can be supplied so many things, how the rich man should be offered? And as far as possible, distribute <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> [break] People should be called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> So we should take the Deity <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and our <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and go to all the houses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no. You invite them, that "Anyone, you are welcome. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" We can announce. Then you can judge how many people are coming daily. You should announce that "Anyone can come and take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at noon." It is the duty of a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> to loudly cry, "If anyone is hungry, please come. We have got still food." That is the duty of a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> If one does not come, then the chief of the house, he takes <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> If somebody says, "I am hungry," so he should offer his own food. "You eat." This is duty of <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanti.</span> Those who are cooking for themselves, they are simply eating sinful things. That's all. <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt</span> [Bg. 3.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So hospitality is one of the duties of the householder. <span class="Italic">Atithi.</span> <span class="Italic">Atithi</span> means guest without any information. That is called <span class="Italic">atithi.</span> <span class="Italic">Tithi</span> means date. So if I go to your house, I inform you that "Such and such date I am coming there." But <span class="Italic">atithi,</span> he does not inform you, all of a sudden comes. So you should have to receive him. That is called <span class="Italic">atithi.</span> <span class="Italic">Pāntha.</span> People are moving... Formerly, if some of the walkers in the street, suppose he has become hungry, so he enters anyone's house. So "I am hungry sir. Give me something to eat." He'll immediately, "Take." <span class="Italic">Pāntha-bhāga.</span> There is a stock of foodstuff which is called <span class="Italic">pāntha-bhāga.</span> If somebody comes all of a sudden, he should take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> The temple should always have some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple must have. Even ordinary <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> That is Vedic civilization, not that we cook for ourself, for my husband, for my wife and children, eat it sumptuously and go to bed. No. Even <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> he should be always prepared to receive guest. Yes. And even a guest comes, your enemy, you should receive him in such a nice way that he will forget that you are all enemies. <span class="Italic">Gṛhe śatrum api prāptaṁ viśvastam akutobhayam.</span> This is Vedic civilization, not that "Beware of dog. Please don't enter here. You are forbidden to come here. And if you come, I shall shoot you." Sometimes they do that. This is not human civilization. It is cats' and dogs' civilization. So actually we are teaching what is human civilization. But we must be also like human being, not cats and dogs. Otherwise how can you teach? If I am like cats and dogs, I cannot criticize others as cats and dogs. I must be first of all human being. Then I shall teach others how to become human being. I must become first of all devotee. Then I shall request others to become devotee. Ā<span class="Italic">pani ācari jīve śikhāilā bhakti.</span> First behave yourself perfectly; then teach others to become perfect. That is preacher. Now we are selling <span class="Italic">The Process of Creation</span> but if I do not know what is the process of creation, we do not read, if you go to sell some book, then if he says, "What is the process of creation? You explain," and if you say, "All right, let me consult my book..." <span class="Italic">Kuto gata vedyaḥ para-hasta-gataṁ dhānam. Para-hasta-gataṁ dhānam</span> means, "I have got enough wealth." "Where it is?" "It is in other hands. It is not in my possession, in others' possession." This kind of possessing wealth has no value. Similarly, when somebody asks you some question, if you say, "Let me consult my book," that knowledge has no value. "Let me consult my book." So all these books are there. You see one <span class="Italic">śloka</span> studying, knowing. It takes one hour. So there are millions of <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span> How much you have to study. So these things are to be noted. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means perfection, all round perfection. Then people will much appreciate. There is no doubt about it. And we can go anywhere, everywhere, because we are pure. We are giving the right thing. So is there any artist here who can draw? You can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So can you make a rough sketch just of this building and in front a temple with arches. I will take and give you photograph. You have got those photographs, Śyāmasundara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You haven't given me yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Second set of photographs that was taken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, oh, of the temple. Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you can make drawing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cintāmaṇi:</span> Make a sketch of this end...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And in front a temple, high arches, big temple. I will give you the photo. Where is the photo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I have negatives. I have to get some photos made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you got some photos made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That other boy in Sydney, Śyāmalālānanda, he has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone takes, but he sleeps. He doesn't deliver. I wanted to send immediately to Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Bombay has a set of photos in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> If you have the negative, we can get them developed while we're at Dai Nippon, thirty minutes. If we take negative today, we can get them developed very quickly at Dai Nippon while we are waiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. That's all right. You take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Get several sets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when we have to go to Dai Nippon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The car will come around noon, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So send Nanda Kumāra to give me massage. I will be ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we set the date of installation for the third, next Wednesday, beginning from 4:30 in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 4:30?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And is there any special thing we should make, prepare for the installation? I think the other... This one boy Steven is taking initiation on that day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhānu:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is it all right to offer the Deity condensed milk that is already condensed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? No. Call... Where is Nanda Kumāra? I shall take massage. (end)</div>
