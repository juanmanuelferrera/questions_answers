<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> This is being recorded on videotape, so it will be broadcast later.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not right now, but later on... [break] ...very little about this...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes. So if I ask questions which, you know, sound sort of ignorant...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes, I shall...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...I ask your indulgence. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You are the expert, and I know very, very little about this.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Expert is Kṛṣṇa. He is expert (indistinct). (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> The expert is Kṛṣṇa. Yes. That much I understand. Yes. In fact Kṛṣṇa is everything. (Prabhupāda chants <i class="calibre3">japa</i>) [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...so he is authorized.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So you are authorized.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I or anyone that follows Kṛṣṇa's instruction.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well maybe, sir, (indistinct) followed Kṛṣṇa. I don't know him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, maybe you ought to find out, because, you know, this is widely distributed in the United States.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My book is authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Macmillan's publishes every year fifty thousand. (stage directions going on in background) You can inquire from your side any reading matter from <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> original. That will be nice. Then I can explain.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> All right. (aside to associate:) You're going to cue me, right? (addressing audience:) Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by all the Vedic scriptures and by the great sages in disciplic succession. He has a body made of eternity, bliss and all knowledge. God has infinite forms and expansions, but of all His forms, His original form, His transcendental form, is as a cowherd boy, a form which He reveals only to His most confidential devotees. So go the teachings of Kṛṣṇa as laid down in the Vedic literature. And of the sages in the disciplic succession, which I mentioned, one is our guest for this conversation today. He is His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, foremost teacher in the West of the Kṛṣṇa philosophy, which, moreover, he teaches not only by word but by example. He came to this country in 1965, on orders of his spiritual master. As a Kṛṣṇa disciple he is the present human exponent of a line of succession going back five hundred years to the appearance in India of Lord Caitanya, and beyond that to a time five thousand years ago, when Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself was on this planet and His words were recorded. Welcome, sir. What..., what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness means that every living being, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has got many expansions. That is called personal expansion and separated expansion. So separated expansions we are, we living entities. But although we are very intimately connected with Kṛṣṇa, somehow or other we are now separated by contact of material nature. So we have practically forgotten that we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Actually, that is a fact. And because he forgets, just like a rich man's son, somehow or other he has forgotten his father, and he's loitering in the streets a poor man. But actually that is not his position. He has forgotten simply. So our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are trying to invoke that original consciousness that he is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Why he should remain in this material world and suffer the threefold miseries? So we want to revive our original consciousness. The original consciousness is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like a man born of a lord's family, his title should be the lord family, but unfortunately, forgetting his own home, he's accepting some menial title. So our whole Vedic literature is meant for that purpose, to revive his original consciousness, <i class="calibre3">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You came, sir, to this country in 1965, as I said, on instructions or orders given you by your spiritual master. By the way, who was your spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My spiritual master was Om Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī <i class="calibre3">Gosvāmī</i>' Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now in this line of succession that we were talking about earlier, this disciplic line of succession which goes way back, all the way back to Kṛṣṇa himself-right?-was your spiritual master the previous one before you?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The disciplic succession is coming from Kṛṣṇa since five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is your spiritual master still alive?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He has passed away in 1936.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So you are, at this particular time then, sort of the head in world of this movement? Would that be correct?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got many other Godbrothers, but I was particularly ordered to do this, and from the very beginning, so I am trying to please my spiritual master, that's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now, you were sent to this country, to the United States of America. This is your territory. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And I...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My territory, what he said, that "You go and speak this philosophy to the English-knowing public."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> To the English-speaking world?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and especially in the Western world. Yes. He told me like that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> When you came, sir, to this country, about fifteen, sixteen years ago, and started...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not fifteen, sixteen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Five, six years ago, I beg your pardon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...to this part of the world, you did not come to a part of the world where religion was lacking as such. In the United States of America we have many religions, and I think people in this country like to believe in great majority that they are religious people, people who believe in God, you know, who devote themselves to some form of religious expression. And I wonder what your thinking was. What do you think that you could add to the already living religious expression in this country by coming here and adding your own philosophy to it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I first came to your country, I was guest of an Indian friend at Butler.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> In Pennsylvania?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pennsylvania. So although it was a small county, I was very much engladdened there were so many churches.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So many churches? Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so many churches. And I spoke in many of the churches there. My host arranged for that. So it was not with that purpose that I came here, to defeat some religious process. That was not my purpose. Our mission is, Lord Caitanya's mission is, to teach everyone how to love God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But in what way, sir, may I ask, in what way did you think, and do you think right now, that the teaching of the love of God which you are doing is different and perhaps better than the teachings of the love of God which already were being conducted in this country, and have been conducted in the Western world for centuries?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is fact. Because we are following the footsteps of Lord Caitanya. He is considered..., He's accepted by us according to the authority of Vedic literature, He is personally Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Which Lord is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Caitanya, He is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> He's the one who came back five hundred years ago?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> To India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India, yes. So He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and He is teaching how to love Kṛṣṇa. Therefore His process is most authorized. Just like you are the expert in this establishment. If somebody is doing something, if you personally teach him, "Do like this,'' that is very authorized. So God consciousness, God Himself is teaching. Just like in <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>, Kṛṣṇa is God, He is speaking about Himself, and at last He says, "Just surrender unto Me, I take charge of you.'' But people misunderstood. So Lord Caitanya, Kṛṣṇa again came as Lord Caitanya to teach people how to surrender. And because we are following the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, the method is so sublime that even foreigners who never knew Kṛṣṇa, they're following it. The method is so potent. So that was my purpose. We don't say that "This religion is better that this religion,'' or "My process is better.'' We want to see by the result. In the Sanskrit there is a word, <i class="calibre3">phalena paricīyate:</i> a thing is judged by the result.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> A thing is judged by what?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By the result.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Oh, yes. Mm-huh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can say, I..., you can say, "My method is very nice.'' You can say your method is very nice. But we have to judge by the result. That is <i class="calibre3">Bhagavat</i> said, that that process of religion is very good, following which one becomes a lover of God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, but of course you know your religion is not the only one which teaches this particular precept.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am explaining, that it is not the only one. There may be many, but it is practically effective.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now in, let's say in the part, in the part of the world where, if I'm understanding your philosophy and your history correctly, in the part in the world where this particular philosophy and this particular belief originate, which is in India, right, in the, the East, the Eastern part of the world, at least as we look at it...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...is it successful there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Do you have a large following there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Recently, I was in India. I held two meetings, I mean continued for ten days, everywhere, and twenty to thirty thousand people were attending daily. The India's position is that they're naturally Kṛṣṇa conscious, but, at the present moment, by the so-called leader, they want to replace this Kṛṣṇa consciousness into material consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness belief or philosophy compatible with the Hindu religion, which is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any religion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Beg your pardon?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any religion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Any religion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because God is one. It is a science of God. If two plus two equal to four, it is understood by everyone. It is not that it is to be understood by the Christian, not by the Hindus. Two plus two equal to four is a fact for everyone. Similarly, God is a fact for everyone. Now, how to love God, this is the only process. That is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now, do you claim, then, that your way of loving God is <i class="calibre3">the</i> way to love God?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. At least for this age.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> For this age?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You mean for Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> For the time that we live in right now?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the method is authorized, Kṛṣṇa prescribes this. Kṛṣṇa Himself and Lord Caitanya. He says that this is the only method for self-realization, or for God-realization, or to learn how to love God. He says. Kṛṣṇa says. Therefore it is authorized. And it is practically happening. Otherwise, these boys and girls, they're foreigners, they never knew Kṛṣṇa. Now, I have got sixty centers, and in each center there are, on the average, hundred devotees. And they have dedicated their life. How it is happening, unless it is authorized?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, you know they say they never knew Kṛṣṇa, and you are, of course, right. But different peoples name their Gods in different ways. You name your God "Kṛṣṇa.'' In the Western world many, many people name their God "Jesus."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Jesus Christ. There are other peoples in different parts of the world who have different names for the Gods which they, uh, pray to.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. We say in that connection that if you have got a name which is actually referring to God, that will also do. Just like we are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right. Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So according to Vedic literature, <i class="calibre3">kṛṣṇaś tu bhagavān svayam:<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.3.28]<i class="calibre3"> </i>Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the... He has got many names, thousands and millions of names; this is the original name. So Caitanya says not that you have to chant "Kṛṣṇa,'' but if you have got actually a name for God, then chant that. We are not asking you that you chant "Kṛṣṇa.'' If you have got actually a name for God, then you can chant that. We are requesting this, "Chant God's holy name."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But before, when you came here... Now you came here in the middle '60s, less than a decade ago. What, what was it-this is why I'm trying to find out from you. What was the motivating force behind your coming to the United States?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already explained. That is already explained. Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted that this propaganda should be made all over the world. And they will accept. So my Guru Maharaja said that "You go and try to do this,'' so I came with this purpose, and it is happening.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> There must have been an element, though, of dissatisfaction on your part with the way God was being..., God was being..., Godhead was being professed in this part of the world before you came. Otherwise there would have been no sense in you coming here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not this part, <i class="calibre3">every part.</i> Every part of the world, practically everyone, very little interest in God. There's more interest in dog.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You are (indistinct) and trying to increase the interest in God. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the only interest we must have in human life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> And you were not particularly interested in what particular name this God has.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Our purport mission is that people may become God conscious. And the process is, in this age, by chanting the holy name of God. If you have got any name for God which is actually name of God, then you'll be successful by chanting that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> The chanting of Kṛṣṇa's name, the Hare Kṛṣṇa <i class="calibre3">mantra</i>, seems to play a very important role in the profession of your religious belief. Right? In fact, I think I will ask you and some of your followers who are sitting here with us tonight, a little bit later, to, to chant the name of Kṛṣṇa. That probably would be a proper ending to this particular program. However, I'm still wondering, you know, about some of the aspects. In reading a little bit-and I have not read much of course-but in reading a little bit about your beliefs and your writings and, you know, your magazine or your publications...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may correct here, that it is not my belief.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well in the, as you interpret it your writings. Let me put it that way. It seems to me sir, that there is a very high emphasis placed on the relationship between the individual and God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Much more so than upon the...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Yes, but more, more emphasis on that relationship than on the relationship between one individual and another individual. Am I right in that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We have to establish first of all our lost relationship with God. You see? Then we can understand what is the relationship between one individual to another. If the central point is missing, then there is practically no relationship. Just like you are American and another is American, both of you, you feel American nationality because the center is America. So unless you understand God, you cannot understand "What I am.'' Neither I can understand what you are. So I have..., we have to first of all reestablish our lost relationship with God, then we can establish, talk of universal brotherhood. Otherwise there will be discrimination. Just like in your country, or any country, the national... National means a man born in that land. Is it not? But they do not take the animals as national. Why they have no right to become national? That is imperfect of knowledge. There is no God consciousness; therefore they think only the man born in this land is national, not others.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> That is not necessarily based on religious principles, of course.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is philosophical principle.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And religion without philosophy is sentiment.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Don't you think there are very good reasons for the existence of these rules and regulations in this respect?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The rules and regulations must be established on philosophy. Otherwise, it is sentiment, defective. Religion without philosophy is sentiment. And philosophy without religion is mental speculation. They should be combined, philosophy and religion. Then it will be perfect.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> I think that in this, in this part of the world, in the Western world, at least as much as I am aware of it, we do place a good deal of emphasis on religion and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Based on philosophy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Well, on religion, what I would like to highlight, what I would like to emphasize is that we place a good deal of emphasis on the religion in the ways it gets one man to deal with another man. The ethic of religion. Now, in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One moment. We must clear.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Beg your pardon?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not concerned how one man deal with another man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not as part of your Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Because we...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is not important, because we know, as soon as one understands how to deal with God, he'll automatically deal with other men very nicely.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> But, you know, let's take the Christian religion, for an example.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> You know the ten commandments for example.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> There is a heavy emphasis in the ten commandments on the relationships between one human being and another, you know. "Thou shalt not kill,'' "Thou shalt not steal,'' you know, that sort of thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I said that Jesus Christ never said..., he never meant "Thou shalt not kill'' means only human beings. Where is that evidence? Jesus Christ never said "Thou shalt not kill'' means, it means only human beings. Thou shalt not kill any animals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Any life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any life. That is religion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> It has never been interpreted that way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have interpreted the wrong way. But he said "Thou shalt not kill.'' He never said "Thou shalt not kill among human beings.'' Why do you interpret in that way?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> How would I recognize a true follower of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by his behavior? What would his traits be? What would his outward expressions be?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. He will be a very perfect gentleman. That's all. You cannot find any fault in him. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore prohibited not to eat meat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Not to eat meat?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore prohibited for illicit sex life. Therefore prohibited to intoxication. They do not smoke even, what to speak of other intoxication. And therefore prohibited not to indulge in gambling. So if they can observe these four rules and regulations, they will become perfect men. Simple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Or women, I presume.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, men or women.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Men or women?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> There is place for women in the religion too, isn't there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, man and woman has got, have got the same right. Just like we are getting married boys and girls. They are following the same principles, the same principles. So these are the four pillars of perfect life. If we indulge in these things-illicit sex life, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling-then they become the four pillars of sinful life. And if we take them away, then they become, the prohibitive portion, becomes the pillars of perfect life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Now I would like to ask you one more question, and I would like to ask you to end the program by chanting your <i class="calibre3">mantra</i> of Hare Kṛṣṇa. One more question though. In the six years that you have been in this country, in the United States, have you been encouraged or discouraged?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am encouraged.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> Encouraged? Why?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because so many devotees are coming daily.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> So many? You say so many. You know, we have maybe, what, two dozen people sitting here. But of course there are...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got sixty centers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Interviewer:</span> ...205 or 210 million Americans.</div>
