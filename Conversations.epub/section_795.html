<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span> he's a... He's madman. Actually everyone is mad. That is the medical report. Do they give some present? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> Not some present, but even, even the policemen, they are stopping the traffic, especially when they see the devotees coming. In Calcutta we saw. We were driving from Germany with Gargamuni Mahārāja in those six vans, and the policemen were especially stopping the traffic so that we could come through. And in New York also, the policemen on the street, they are dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> When the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party is coming, sometimes they are raising their arms and they are dancing also, because they see that we are, that this movement is not like the other movements. The others, they are just staying hippies, and now they are... They have some guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascal gurus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> Like you said yesterday, they are all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has been discussed by that professor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> From France?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> He said they have..., these translations of Aurobindo and Ramakrishna are modernized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> I think they are modernized and compromised. That's why they are so popular, because you can do whatever you want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not popular, not very.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> Yeah, and they aren't even popular, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Popular amongst the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> They do not know anything, and they write books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Didn't that Dr. Radhakrishnan go crazy at the end of life, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> I think you have visited him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> ...and he was not able to even talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> How can that be God? (end)</div>
