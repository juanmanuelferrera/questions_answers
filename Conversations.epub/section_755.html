<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How degraded they have become. There is no food, and they are busy for growing tobacco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> ...You say that's what they call a cash crop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> The other day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now eat cash. So cash is also paper. So what is the use of laboring so hard? You eat paper. Paper is available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It is prohibited to buy gold at that temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You cannot buy gold. Government has prohibited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are rascal, your government is rascal-democracy. What is the government? Government means your replica. So why do you blame the government? You are fools, rascals; you send other fools and rascals and suffer consequence. [break] ...tea, growing tobacco, growing jute, and no grains. And grain for the animal, so that animal, as soon as it becomes fatty, send it to the slaughterhouse, and then finish business. Smoke, eat meat, drink, and be happy. So much land, but it is producing tobacco, which we are prohibiting, "No smoking." [break] Vegetable is utilized. (Hindi) These crops. (Hindi) [break] <span class="Italic">...nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi) ...effulgence.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What is meant, "halo" and "effulgence"? That word meaning, "halo"? <span class="Italic">Prabhā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Halo is <span class="Italic">ksatta(?).</span> Practically the same meaning. [break] ...field is green and this field is not green? If you take care every field will be green. [break] ...<span class="Italic">prasādam</span> to the audience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sumptuous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Full plate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then accept program. [break] ...distribution of <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> then we can go everywhere, whole day program, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and distribution. So that is meant.
