<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I saw the plans for it; it's very nice. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah, this is rocky. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two millions types of vegetables and trees. Two million. What these rascals know? The botanists might have seen thousands, but two millions there are. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) So they are getting bitter melon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They have got already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. Bitter melon, eggplant, maybe this <span class="Italic">mankachu</span> (?). They prepare. They will be very nice combination, yes. Buy one vegetable, you can eat whole thing. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> We will try and get some squash leaves, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I remember when we were here four years ago you had them.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...the word...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salt, salt, turned into sand. Salty water, silica. Sodium silicate. Salt is called sodium carbonate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes, it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? [break] From any earth you'll find some percentage of salt. [break] ...for increasing population, but we rascals, we have made, "No, you cannot come here. You rot there." This is our civilization. India, China is overpopulated. So if people allow, just like Australia, Africa, and many islands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Russia is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Oh, it's too cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is for the Russians. But there are so many other islands like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Tahiti.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Tahiti. Also is... Below here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> There are thousands of islands in the Pacific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Let them come and live here. Produce foodstuffs, have cows, fruits, flowers, live peacefully, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; but they won't allow. Americans, yes, they have got so much land. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam, tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Whatever is Kṛṣṇa's property, you can... You are Kṛṣṇa's son; you can utilize it. But one son is prohibiting, "No, no, you cannot enter here." This is the problem. The so-called nationalism is dangerous. Just see how nice flowers, fruits, plant. Everything is there, complete.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">There is no question of overpopulation at all. These rascals have created like that. Hare Kṛṣṇa. They're coming from our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. Jayaśrī is here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Thank you. Jayaśrī joined when I first came here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Feeling all right? I think you joined when I first came here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayaśrī:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. [break] <span class="Italic">...savitā sakala-grahāṇām. Gāyatrī mantra</span> is worshiping the sun. <span class="Italic">Yac cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ,</span> unlimitedly powerful, unlimitedly heated. <span class="Italic">Aśeṣa,</span> how much heat is there, your brain cannot accommodate. And therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">aśeṣa-tejāḥ:</span> "without any limit." This is God's creation. Where is the scientist who can create a small sun? How this water is going there? Where is the pipe? You rascal, if you want to pump your water in the skyscraper building, you require pumping and pipe and so many things, but where is the pipe? And where is the pumping station or pumping machine? But you'll find so much water. How the water is transferred there? What is their explanation? They'll use simply some bogus jugglery of words. That's all. But produce it, without pipe, without pump. Let the water go up, up. "Yes, we are trying. In future we shall do it." And what about of the present? Who is that scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They say it is an accident, that the world is going to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are rascals. Therefore I always say, "Kick them on their face with your shoes, so-called scientists." "Accident." There is no question of accident. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Therefore they have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as <span class="Italic">mūḍhāḥ,</span> rascals, <span class="Italic">narādhama. Narādhama,</span> the lowest of the mankind. Because they got this opportunity to appreciate the work of Kṛṣṇa, but they avoid it, they are <span class="Italic">narādhama.</span> No, they are so big, big graduate, scientists, and..." <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Their real knowledge is taken away, simply childish proposing something, so-called scientists. Real knowledge is to see everywhere Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> The supervision of Kṛṣṇa. That is real knowledge. Not only to appreciate, but to explain it also. <span class="Italic">Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</span> will appreciate, but cannot explain how it is being done. <span class="Italic">Madhyama-adhikārī</span> will explain. That is preacher. And <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī,</span> he thinks that everyone knows, everyone knows. He does not see that somebody knows, somebody does not know. He sees everyone knows. That is <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī.</span> He does not make any distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> He does not preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No. He's <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Does not preach means he preaches, but he comes to the second-class platform. The first-class platform means he does not make any distinction between devotee and nondevotee. He sees everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Does he consciously come from the first-class to second-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Just like Jesus Christ says that there was many things to be said by, by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> "There are many things, but I can, but you cannot, I have to tell you, but you cannot bear them now."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so that means he's first-class, but he comes to the second-class platform or third-class platform to teach the third-class, second-class person. He's first class. Son of God cannot be second-class or third-class. He must be first-class. But... Just like Lord Buddha. He's God Himself, but He said nothing about God because he knew that "These rascals, they will not be able to... Let them stop meat-eating, that's all. Let them become sinless first of all; then they will be able..." So his main preaching was <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā,</span> non-violence, no meat-eating. But still, they violate that. Jesus Christ also preached, "Thou shall not kill," but these rascals, all violating. And still, they are proclaiming as Christian and Buddhist. No religion will, real religion, will allow this kind of violence, no religion. It is cheating religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ kaitavaḥ:</span> Any religion committing unnecessary violence to the animals, (it is) third-class. It is not religion, it is cheating. Simply cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They believe it's very necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They believe because they're rascals. Why necessary? We are not meat-eaters, why it is necessary? You have created necessary. Tongue. <span class="Italic">Tār madhye jihvā ati lobhamoy sudurmati:</span> "The tongue is very greedy and it does not satisfy." Therefore they create their necessity. Civilized human, how they can eat meat? It is meant for the cats, dogs, tigers, not for human beings. So they're not human beings even. Actually they're animals. What religion animals may have? [break] ...Kṛṣṇa's craftsmanship, from one seed, a small, such a big tree has come, and within that seed there are the potency of demonstrating how variegatedness, nicely, within that seed. You produce such things? Make by chemical composition something and sow it and a tree will come out like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We will have it next year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Next year we will have it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes, we are working on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is working on it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The scientists always say, "Next year, next year."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next year. Then before next year coming, he will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They're producing large trees out of plastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They make, they can make a whole at... Just like this island, they can make out of plastic. Plastic coconut trees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many they can make?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They do not reproduce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They don't reproduce, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply they're rascals and who are bewildered by rascals, they are also rascals. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's an animal, and their work is appreciated by another animal. The so-called scientists' advancement of knowledge is appreciated by another rascal, not any intelligent man. We can appreciate, but when they're godless, we kick him out. Just see. This is the... Now, this is a solid thing. How it grows and how the water comes? Now it will not grow. Because (it is) detached. But if it remains attached, it will grow. So wherefrom the water is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> From the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you'll find that it is well protected cell, and you find two pieces of <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi</span> and one glass of water, ready. No need of cooking. Yes. You simply take. Take the water and take the pulp and eat pulp and the glass of water. That's all. Your meal is finished; luncheon is finished. You don't require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The atheist class of men, they are thinking "Well, we are watering. We are giving the water with the hose. We are giving water in the tree. Just like this man is cutting the lawn. So we are maintaining it." They are not thinking that Kṛṣṇa is giving the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then wherefrom water comes? You rascal, wherefrom you got the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They say, "It's too much to think about."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...in Time magazine yesterday, and the scientists are thinking now that man is his mind. They were talking about the brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That if man only knew his mind he would know himself. What is actually the brain? And the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind, that is also matter, material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They're saying that the mind or the brain is the source of man's consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Brain is the instrument for expressing consciousness. Otherwise, when the man is dead, why the brain does not work? Do you follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the brain work stops?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The soul leaves the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Body is also material. Spirit soul, so long there is within the body, it works. You cut this tree and it will dry, it will not work. So long the soul is there, it is very luxuriant, very beautiful. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...further?</div>
