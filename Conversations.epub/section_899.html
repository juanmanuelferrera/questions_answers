<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If we say all these things, they will cut my head. (laughs) Therefore I don't say in the public meeting all these things. But it is actually dog's life(?). No value. Actually, no value. We cannot give any value to this type of civilization, running like dog with car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember in South Africa though, Prabhupāda, you called them, (laughs) at every meeting, dogs and cats. And afterward they were always applauding. (claps)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He did that, (laughing) you did that in South India as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, when I come into emotion, I cannot check to speak the truth. But actually it is the fact. I cannot give any credit to these rascals (laughs) who are running at high speed, big, big car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did we read? There was an article about Mars today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. Nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The scientists, again...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They were speculating about.... They sent this spaceship to Mars, and they were speculating that maybe now the so-called smog that covers the surface of the planet, it could be fog. It could be made of ice and water particles. So now they..., so they were speculating like that. And then they said they were going to land the spaceship in a valley at a certain point that is four miles deep and that may..., it may have been filled with water fifty thousand years ago, and it could have fossils in it from the type of life that existed there, if it existed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty thousand years ago. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientist rascal. How ludicrous. Simply "maybe," "if it was" and "it will be." That's all. Simply "maybe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. They were speculating about, even they didn't know what the atmosphere was, and yet they know, yet they were stating that they were going to land this spaceship at a certain point just below the Martian equator in a valley which is just at the mouth of the valley, which is four miles deep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people are taking, "Oh, it is scientific research."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are such rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This cheating has to stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This cheating has to be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And actually, on the same page, what was that, the percentage scientists are engaged in warfare?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Forty percent of all the scientists in the world, the estimate is, are engaged in making weapons. And it said that since the end of World War II, six trillion dollars, which is six thousand billion dollars, have been spent on armament in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The West, did it say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, no money. They can't.... (laughs) They have no sufficient money to eat even. Still they are spending more than fifty percent, fifty-four percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They estimate there's four hundred thousand so-called scientists working on armament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Working on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Armament. Weapons. Weapon development. Defense. They call it defense measures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Why defense? Man to man. That means they are dogs. The dogs defend from another dog. Is it not? As soon as they see another dog, (growls) <span class="Italic">yow, yow, yow.</span> So then where is the defense between man to man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're worried now that they won't be able to disarm, the article was saying, because, somehow or another, there's going to be a disaster unless there is immediate disarmament. But they don't think it's possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. How they can disarm? They have been trained up like dogs to bark and fight. How there can be disarmament?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've been talking about disarmament for who knows how long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've been talking about disarmament for years and years together. But they're simply increasing. There's no disarmament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even within the different religions they are fighting amongst each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This religion is also bogus. How the dogs can understand religion? It is simply woax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Simply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woax, woax, what is called? Woax?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Wasp?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like a bee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Colossal woax. H-o-a-x. Find out this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> H?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> H-o-a-x.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hoax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hoax! Joke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everything's just a bluff. Just a show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hoax, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rubber-stamping</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hoax means "to deceive, take in, sometimes by way of joke; humorous or mischievous deception."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vibhrama,</span> the Sanskrit is <span class="Italic">vibhrama-milita-kriyā.</span> The <span class="Italic">ārambha, ārambha</span> means endeavor. Very gorgeous. The result is sand and rocks. Going to the moon planet, the <span class="Italic">ārambha</span> was so much expensive. And the result is to bring some sand and rocks. This is hoax. And another: <span class="Italic">parvatān muṣakodbhavaḥ.</span> Hoax. There was a great advertisement that the Himalayan mountain is going to deliver a child. So people gathered on, to see, "Oh, such a big mountain. The child must be a very big child." So they went to see there, and they saw one rat is coming from the hole of.... A rat is coming. They expected another Himalayan mountain, and they saw from the holes, one rat is coming. This is going on. And they are satisfied. "Now the Himalaya has delivered the child." One rat. (laughs) This attempt is like Himalayas begetting a child. If some elephant would have come, it would have saved the..., not even elephant, one rat. And in English, another is, "Much ado about nothing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Shakespeare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The result is nothing. What is the meaning of "ado"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Endeavor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Endeavor. Yes. So these things are like that. Not sober. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are not sober. <span class="Italic">Adhīra.</span> Therefore they meet with so many accidents. You also. As soon as we're in the car, he wants to drive at a hundred miles speed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it was token punishment, but I'm sorry if you were in the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) What is the use? You are not going to serve anyone that we have to go high speed. We can go comfortably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We can make our own pace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śyāmasundara also. He was driving seventy-five. And what you are doing? What is that? This country, Portland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oregon? From Eugene to Oregon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oregon, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was in the car with you in the back seat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you were in the car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They all fell asleep. I was chanting. You were sitting, you didn't even go to sleep that night (laughs). Even though it was late at night, it was about eleven, twelve, one o'clock at night, you didn't want to stay at that <span class="Italic">bhogī</span> yogi house. I remember that. And he drove very, very fast back to Portland. That was a very nice engagement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. That was Śyāmasundara's father's car. So he's a good driver, (laughter) but very dangerous driver. I do not know, Śyāmasundara, his father is a rich man, lawyer, got good estate and he's the only son. He did not like to stay with father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No one in the West likes to stay with their parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two sisters, very beautiful girls. They're unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're unhappy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. His two sisters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard he was preaching to them. At least one of them that came to the temple that time. She came to that program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She first of all came in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> She was piano player.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, they're artists. They're artists. They're not happy. Divorced. His mother is very gentle, I have seen. Father is also respectable man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Family life in the West is disastrous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The father wants to get them back at home, but they don't.... The father is also taking pills for sleeping. (laughs) Father is also not happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the thing. In the West, even though the opulence is there, the children can see the parents are not happy. The parents are always full of anxiety. So even though the parents want the children to stay at home, the children they resent that, because they can see that "You have nothing to offer. It's just a facade."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't want to become like their parents. They don't see that their parents are a desirable example to follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Wine and sex. They see from childhood. One boy, Rancor, so his father and mother divorced and he was young child. He was the first child of his mother. And the mother, he said, would daily bring a new friend. So he could understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> A new woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not new woman, his mother, he was under the care of mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, mother had new husbands, new boyfriends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Daily night. And he was shocked. One of my Gauḍīya Maṭha Godbrothers, big, he became the head of this Bhag Bazaar Gauḍīya Maṭha. So his wife was debauched, and she was bringing new paramour, and the child protested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> New?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paramour. And the boy, he was ten years or twelve years old, he could understand: "Who is this man?" So he protested and said, "I shall tell all these things to my father." And he was killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The boy was killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She murdered him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Killed means given poison. And the father, that is, my Godbrother, seeing this, he also took poison. This is the end of Gauḍīya Maṭha scandal. He was also one of the trustees. This Tīrtha Mahārāja was a trustee, and another Godbrother and this man. In the beginning, they were made trustees. In the beginning, Prabhupāda was to undergo surgical operation. So he was a little nervous, that "I may die." So he made a scrap paper, that "In case I die, these three disciples will be trustees of the Gauḍīya Maṭha Institute." That's all. So this Kuñja Bābu kept this. There are many long histories. So one of the so-called trustees was this Vāsudeva. So he died, his end was like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> His son was killed, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife was a regular prostitute, and she killed her child, and on this shock, he took poison and died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He killed himself, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally, he became shocked, that "This is my family life-the wife is prostitute and son is killed. What is the value of my life?" This was his spiritual realization. Just see. (laughs) And he was made the chief, and one of the supporter was Śrīdhara Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vāsudeva Śrīdhara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He was made chief. Guru Mahārāja did not make him chief. But after his passing away, some of our Godbrothers voted him chief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Am I mis...? You had told me once, I'm not certain. Maybe I made a mistake. You said that Vāsudeva, it was known fact that he was homosex?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vāsudeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was homosex and sex, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in this city.... I haven't been back in so many years to America. Things have become more degraded. I'm watching women and women walking arm around each other. And I asked, "What is this?" "Oh," he says "they are lesbians." Women together, girlfriends. They don't mix with men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is now very much prevalent in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No higher consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I had one disciple, she was for that purpose (?), yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> So one professor is already here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This is Shivaram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Should I turn this light on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You also sit down. Note down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I want to get the newspapers that you wanted. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can I do? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> I'll speak to Rāmeśvara and see if we can do something to publish it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I began with these men are running in car and the dog is running on leg, where is the difference. His running by car is his advancement of civilization. They are taking running by car, never mind the passenger is a dog. (laughter) But the passenger is running on car, a dog, therefore he's a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They use these cars for running after women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the same thing. Just like dog runs after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What will the program be? Won't Prabhupāda speak down there also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is speaking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'll just see if everything is ready. (end)</div>
