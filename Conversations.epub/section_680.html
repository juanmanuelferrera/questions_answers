<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> There are many small parks, but biggest park is here. One is at Kakaiya(?), near the lake. That old lake is... A five-hundred-(year)-old lake is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is supposed to be the biggest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Because here people are only after money, so they are not care to give charity for any park when it is (unclear). There is no private charity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the duty of the municipality. [break] ...program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The whole thing was completely packed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who spoke?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Acyutānanda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> In Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> For more than one hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes. One hour he spoke. About ten percent English words, twenty-five percent Sanskrit, and rest in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He spoke very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> People were very happy, and they could understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Philosophy was presented nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes. Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You spoke? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I spoke also, ten, fifteen minutes in the beginning. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] (Hindi) ...<span class="Italic">kīrtana viṣṇoḥ,</span> about Viṣṇu, not nonsense. [break] ...speak in Hindi, they will hear more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Yes, they like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot speak Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I can't give discourses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) "Yes, no, very good." You know this story, "Yes, no, very good"? No? There was one <span class="Italic">kansamar(?)</span>. So he was to go home, so he asked his friend that "So long I am not here, you serve European master." So he said, "I do not know English. How can I serve him?" "No, no, no. These three words will do: 'yes, no, very good.' " Then he was engaged. (laughs) Then one day from the master's room something was missing. So he asked the new servant, "You have taken it?" "Yes." (laughter) Then he asked him, "Return it." "No." (laughter) "Oh, then I shall hand you over to the police." "Very good." (laughter) Then when the police came, he was won..., "Sir, what is this? You have...?" "No, I do not know this." Then he was explained, that "I understand these three words only: 'yes, no, very good.' " That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's very wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us walk little more. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Oh, yes, it is very wet. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Everything will come out very good. But the rascals will not do that. That is the difficulty. They will make plan. (aside:) Which way? Kṛṣṇa's plan they will not take. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> Is it because the leaders are not following? Therefore the population is not following?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> The wrong example is given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> The leaders are rascals, therefore they are rascals. The father is rascal; the son is rascal. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says that "If you are a rascal, don't become a father." <span class="Italic">Pit na sa syāt, na mocayed ya samupeta-mṛtyum.</span> "If you are a rascal, don't become a mother." Stop population. They have therefore invented, "Yes, we shall become 'bachelor father,' 'bachelor daddy,' " not actual father but "bachelor father." Here woman at least think nowadays that she must have a husband. In Western countries they don't think. "No, there is no need of husband." Am I right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't think there is need of husband. Eh? But they feel. That I know. I have seen one girl. She saw another friend, "Oh, she has got a husband," whispering. So I can understand that everyone aspires after husband, but there is no hope. Hopelessness. This is the position. Every woman wants a good husband, good home, good children, little ornaments, nice food. That is the ambition of every woman, but they are hopeless. Although they are well qualified, European, American girls, they are hopeless, not to get any husband, not to get any home. This is their position. I have studied thoroughly. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hopelessness. When we see in our association all these girls. They are so nicely, well qualified. Whatever they are taught, they immediately pick up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> In America they were asking my wife how Indian women are able to keep such devotion for their husbands. So they are actually very much interested and envious of this situation in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the nature. That is... They want to be a faithful wife, but there is no husband. Where to become faithful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So then they want to become liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Being hopeless repeatedly, now they want liberation. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">samājīs</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> There are many. They fight with us. Over in office, when they come, they speak such ill words about many of our religious leaders and God. They are so much brainwashed, completely brainwashed. They call themselves Hindus, but they do not want to follow any God, only <span class="Italic">brahma-tattva</span> or <span class="Italic">Brahman.</span> They believe in the <span class="Italic">Vedas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Actually they are atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nāstika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Like Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> That man said they have muscular body and they have muscular mind. That man was very much correct, absolutely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> We have got our <span class="Italic">Punjābī samāj.</span> We have got our building and some two, three years back when you people come, there was one meeting over there. So we wish that this year also, if you spare some time, which time can be suitable to you. You are already booked for Rajasthan? After that are you staying here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So when you can arrange meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> When it is convenient to you. Today, tomorrow. Can it be tomorrow evening? No.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> There is going to be a lot of people there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. What time? Seven to ten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Seven to ten you are at Rajasthan's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So before that, we can go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Before that, our merchants, they generally return from market at about 8:30 or 8. Tomorrow is Sunday. You are not free... You are leaving tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kartikeya:</span> He is leaving by 8:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomorrow morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Tomorrow morning you are leaving.</div>
