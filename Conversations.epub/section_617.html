<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because it would greatly facilitate my preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are already preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But many of the devotees are not so inclined to listen to a householder, as to a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...was seeing in that paper, the meeting, a photograph of Jaya Prakash Narayana and Mrs. Gandhi. Both of the meetings were overcrowded. So who is right and who is wrong? People were hearings in throngs both of them. So? Who is wrong, who is right? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...newspaper report here was that the crowds who came to cheer Indira Gandhi that they were paid, paid crowds. They would pay them one rupee each.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> (laughter) Yes. That is for car or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Car, yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...any bird called thunderbird?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh. We have got an idea of thunderbird. The bird flies in the, near the cloud in expectation of water, and they are not afraid of thunder. That is called <span class="Italic">cataka.</span> That example is given by Rūpa Gosvāmī. The <span class="Italic">cataka</span> does not take water from ground. They will take water when it falls from the cloud. So in the beginning of every cloud there is thunder. So this bird, because they expecting water from the cloud, the cloud is giving him thunder, but still he does not, will not take water from ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> In what connection do the Gosvāmīs use that example to illustrate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Example means a devotee will take mercy from Kṛṣṇa, not from the material world. Even there is thunder, Kṛṣṇa does not give mercy but puts him into difficulty, still, he will not take any mercy from the material world. This is the ex... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are showing your mercy upon us. How do we prevent ourselves from becoming <span class="Italic">guru-druha,</span> or ungrateful for the benediction you are giving us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, you want to be <span class="Italic">guru-druha?</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. [break] ...come when there will be lightning, thunder but there will be no rain. (end)</div>
