<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...accepted in that group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Suppose if somebody is absolutely ignorant about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore there should be education. Why the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> are there? Why guru is there? <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> You must accept guru and learn. Why should you remain ignorant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How one should start when he's completely ignorant of all these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He should go... <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena...</span> [Bg. 4.34].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paripraśnena sevayā.</span> He should become a disciple of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> guru. Otherwise how he can learn. If you are uneducated, you should go to school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You want to ask anything? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) It is very difficult to, to guru, but when <span class="Italic">guru</span> comes, they also do not accept him. What can be done? They are so fallen. Only fortunate. <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> So to go to guru, to Kṛṣṇa, that requires fortune. <span class="Italic">Kona bhāgyavān jīva.</span> Some fortunate person. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> By the mercy of guru and Kṛṣṇa, he gets the seed of this <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> And when he's a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> then he can understand what is God. (To disciple:) Get the light. <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānā...</span> No, there. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi for some time, a few English words) [break] (Hindi for some time) [break] When the destiny of the people are to be controlled, there must be very, very intelligent man. That is Vedic civilization. There is standard aims and objects on which the people should be trained up. That is <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma. Viṣṇur ārādhanam.</span> Worshiping Viṣṇu. This is the ultimate aim. So the whole society is divided into <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</span>, <span class="Italic">sannyāsa-</span>departmental-and they are trained up. But the aim is <span class="Italic">viṣṇur ārādhanam.</span> But they have no idea at the present moment. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇur ārādhanam,</span> he has no knowledge. But the civilization begins on this point. Human being means he's meant for <span class="Italic">viṣṇur ārādhanam.</span> Otherwise what is the difference between dogs and human beings? The western people, they do not know. They simply think that dog lies down on the floor, on the road... "We have got nice, best apartment. Therefore we are civilized." So that is their defect. They are trying to improve the condition of sleeping, eating. That's all. That is advancement of civilization. But that is not advancement of civilization. Advancement of civilization means to understand Viṣṇu, how to please Him, how to go back to Him, go to the spiritual world. This is advancement of civilization. <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6].</span> They do not know all these things. Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> All these men are exactly like dogs, hogs, camel and asses. So by their vote, by the votes of dogs, hogs, camel and asses, another big ass, big dog, will be on the government. So what does he know, how to govern? Do you think if you make a dog king, it will be good government. Or a camel king, it will be good government? So it is happening so. The dogs, hogs, camels and asses, they are voting. Another big camel, another big dog is on the governmental head. How can you expect good government? After all, he's a dog, hog and camel. How can you expect good government from him? Instead of a petty dog, if you enthrone a very big dog... What is the big dog? Does it mean the condition will improve? That is the position now. Just like what is this Nixon? He's a big dog. That's all. And therefore now people are accusing him. What is the condition now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It's just dragging, dragging on. Now he's become sick. He's ill. He's in the hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He must be. So many attacks. How he can tolerate. He's in the post. This is happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-bhāminī:</span> This idea of democracy came at a time in French history called the Period of Enlightenment, and it was introduced by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Democracy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Democracy was first introduced in an age which they call the Age of Enlightenment in French history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-bhāminī:</span> The idea was that everyone should be pleased, that everyone should take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, where is the... In France, everyone is pleased? That is the imagination. You see. <span class="Italic">Vox populi,</span> peoples' government. People, generally, general people, they are fools and rascals. How a government of fools and rascals can improve? It's not possible. They're ignorant. <span class="Italic">Abodha-jāta.</span> They have no knowledge. The knowledge of eating, sleeping, mating, defending, that is animal knowledge. Everyone knows it. How to eat, nobody requires any education. How to sleep, nobody requires and any education. How to have sex life, nobody requires any education. How to defend, nobody requires education. They are not subject matter of education. Everyone knows it, how to do it. The modern education means they are on this subject matter. Just like that rascal, Freud?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Freud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written a big philosophy on sex life. Does it require any education? Anyone knows how to use sex life. And he has written big book. Similarly, defense also: they are making big, big arrangements, atomic bomb. I am making atomic bomb, you are making... Similarly, sleeping: big, big skyscraper building; eating: start thousands of slaughterhouse. Formerly also there were meat-eaters. But did they maintain slaughterhouse? "All right, I want to eat meat. Just go in the forest. Kill one animal. That's all. Pick it up." So this advancement of civilization means advancement of slaughterhouse, advancement of skyscraper building, advancement of atom bomb, advancement of Freud philosophy. This is advancement. The subject matter is the same, which does not require any education. Nobody requires education on this subject matter. Even the birds and beasts, they know what is their eatable. And they eat and they live. Now the advancement... Agricultural institute, a big college, how to improve agriculture. Crude people, they are producing also. Without agricultural college, they are producing sufficiently grain and eating. Still they do so. Do they depend on agricultural education? Real education is how to solve the problems of life, birth, death, old age, and how to go back to home, back to... That is education. This is not education. This is simply waste of time. Because you cannot change your destiny. Now, take for example, there are so many agricultural improvements. Does it mean that there is no person who is needy? There are so many needy persons. But has the agricultural education improved their lot? No. Starving people are still there. Rather, those who can produce, they're producing and throwing into the sea. They'll not part with it for the poor men who are starving. Then where is the advancement of education? You produce more by advanced agricultural process and then throw it into the ocean. Real purpose was to produce more to see that nobody's hungry. That is not being done. There is no sympathy. This is not civilization. This is a hodge-podge. Simply wasting labor. That's all. Now here, the Parliament, now what is the use of Parliament? They have lost their empire. What is the use of Parliament? Formerly they had to rule all over the world. So representative, Parliament... Now they have got... What they have got? But still they have got the Parliament, the bodyguard, the King, Queen. Show only. Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this so-called advancement of civilization has no meaning. Simply waste of time.</div>
