<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, it cannot be.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as they say <span class="Italic">anitya,</span> then they are duality. There is no oneness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So I have read both the type of acclamation (?), <span class="Italic">nitya</span> and <span class="Italic">anitya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then... One who says <span class="Italic">anitya... Anitya...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānām.</span> That means we, <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> we are plural number, and the Supreme Lord is singular number. So what is the difference? The difference is that <span class="Italic">eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That <span class="Italic">bahu-vacana, nityānām,</span> they are maintained by the singular number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> He is only one. But He is, I mean, fulfilling their... This is so many, all. Because He actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is feeding everyone. He is feeding His devotee, as well as nondevotees. The nondevotees are also provided by God. The nondevotees, they are not independent. They are also dependent. But they do not acknowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the prisoners. They are also maintained by government. And those who are not prisoners, they are also maintained by government. The prisoners are outlaw. They do not recognize the government. That is prisoner, criminals. But both of them are provided by the government. And so far individuality is concerned, that is mentioned in the Second Chapter. Kṛṣṇa said that "You, Me, and all these soldiers and kings, they were before existing like this, they're existing now like this, and they'll continue to exist." So individuality's always. Kṛṣṇa never said that "After this, we shall become a homogeneous mass." Never says. Individual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Just as the bees gather honey from different trees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they keep their individuality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...and when the whole mass comes from, each small particle of honey does not know that he's from a particular tree, like that, he becomes... After the whole thing he gets, what do you call? The deluge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Those, the collector, they remain individual, after and before. And while on the beehive. Always individual. That is the point. When they begin collecting honey, they're individual. And after collecting, when they make a beehive, they're individual. Or when they're sitting on the beehive, they're individual. Eternal. This is eternal. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] So what is that? <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... So they... <span class="Italic">Śarīram, śarīraṁ yad avāpnoti.</span> They get different bodies. But they're individuals. They're individuals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are individuals till there is a salvation. And after, they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, salvation means when they have ceased to accept the material body. That is salvation. <span class="Italic">Śarīraṁ yad avāpnoti.</span> So <span class="Italic">avāpnoti</span> means it was not, in the spiritual body there was no such thing, but they accept this material body.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but I have read in <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti</span> that all these <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> also, after the age of forty years, they come to the stage of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> I don't know how.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There is no bar. One may be... One may be uneducated now. He can be educated.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because he, by his own action, becomes <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> because he does the service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Anyone who is engaged in the <span class="Italic">arcanā</span> of the Supreme, he's neither of these: <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> He is Brahman, he has realized Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhuto 'bhijāyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is no more <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> In the material world, even if you become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> that is not a very good position. That is <span class="Italic">māyā:</span> "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But a <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> are also from the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are also. They are also. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has denied: "I am not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> I am not a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> I am not a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> I am not a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> none of these." He said, <span class="Italic">gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am the servant of the servant of <span class="Italic">Gopī-bhartuḥ.</span>" That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's identification.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot... You do not go to a blind man. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> Where you shall surrender? You are blind. If you surrender to a blind man, what is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who surrenders there, you also surrender. Not the body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all, try to understand. You can surrender to a person when you think that "This person is..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...better than me."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Heavier. Correct, correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So otherwise, where is the question of surrender? Nobody wants to surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the heavier, everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Heavier means in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> According to the law of Newton also, heavy articles attract the light articles. You are heavier...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Newton was a rascal. You know Newton was a rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am also one. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Newton was a rascal. He made two holes in the door. And one friend came, "Why you have made these two holes in your door?" He said, "There are two cats, bigger and the smaller. So let them go out." So he asked, "With the bigger hole the smaller cannot go?" "Yes, yes. You are right." (laughter) Any conditioned soul, he may be Newton or this or that, they are all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but some of the highest... I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nobody is highest. Because everyone, everyone is in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ignorance is right, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore rascals!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Though their knowledge is ignorance, it is that, Brahman knowledge is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore you have to... Therefore the indication is <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā...</span> [Bg. 4.34]. You should go and take knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I talk of the Einstein. Einstein, somebody asked Einstein...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Do you believe in God?" He said, "How can you not believe in God? God is everywhere, and I feel the presence of it." That is the real scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not the other fellows who say there is no God and all these things are atoms and all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still, he does not know that Kṛṣṇa is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is... That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is ignorance. That is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...ignorance of God! That means there will be a quarrel between us two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is ignorance. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as he does not know Kṛṣṇa, he is ignorant. Therefore it will take time. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When actually he becomes a man in knowledge, then he surrenders. So so long one does not know Kṛṣṇa, he's a fool. And that is our definition. Now, Mr. Sar(?), I am right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You are right, Sir. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, even though you may not be right, he will say right because he's very much frightened of your calling him a... What do you call me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, I'm a vagabond type of man, thick-skinned. You may call me anything. I don't mind. You see? (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> After all, the views, you see. Everybody is right in his own views. You see. You cannot challenge... After all, the views are given by the God. The <span class="Italic">jñāna-śakti's</span> from God, from the Almighty, and not your self. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why, why Kṛṣṇa gives you less knowledge and other's more knowledge? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is Kṛṣṇa partial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. As long as you're more conscious, then He gives you more knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Conscious is not. Because <span class="Italic">ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because the surrender is not full, therefore he's also not fully realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He's not fully... Correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's correct.</div>

Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante.</span> So if your surrender is twenty-five percent, then Kṛṣṇa is realized twenty-five percent. If your surrender is cent percent, then Kṛṣṇa is realized cent percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Can I say the same <span class="Italic">yathā</span> and <span class="Italic">tathā:</span> "The way he surrenders, the way I give..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means proportionate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Why proportionate? Why not other way? The way I surrender in the lower knowledge of science is, well, he has given me the knowledge of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They have given you the knowledge, the higher knowledge of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa, Brahman is Paramātmā, Brahman and Bhagavān. So if you surrender to Brahman, so you realize Brahman. If you surrender to Paramātmā, you realize Paramātmā, and if you surrender to Bhagavān, you realize Bhagavān.</div>

I suppose, I think like that, that I have got a mind, think like nonsense and do like nonsense, and I have got this body, and I have got my family. So everything I surrender." This is surrender. Don't think anything else, what Kṛṣṇa does not like. That is first surrender. No reservation, that "So much I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, and I contemplate like this, like that, like that." That is not surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is not surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And what about desires?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Desire, this is desire. This is desire, that you don't make your desire: "Kṛṣṇa, come. I'll see You." No, don't make that desire. If Kṛṣṇa likes, He will make His, I mean to say, audience before you. A devotee never says that "Kṛṣṇa, please come. I'll see You."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are many songs: "O my dear Kṛṣṇa, please come dancing with Your flute. I will see." These are not devotees' songs. Kṛṣṇa will never say, uh, devotee will never say, order. No more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Devotees are... The real devotees are <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply he's to carry the order. He's not to make orders. That is devotee. Everyone, in the material world, they worship demigods-why?

Please give me that." <span class="Italic">Rūpaṁ dehi, bhāryāṁ dehi, yaśo dehi,</span> this <span class="Italic">dehi,</span> this <span class="Italic">dehi, dehi...</span> Therefore they go to demigods. But to Kṛṣṇa he cannot demand. And therefore they do not go; they do not become Vaiṣṇavas. You see? You'll see, all the devotees of Lord Śiva, they demanded something. "My dear Lord Śiva, you are so nice. Please give me this." "What do you want?" "Now, I shall touch anyone's head and head will be cut off." "All right, that's all." These things you cannot get from Kṛṣṇa. These things you cannot get from Kṛṣṇa. Therefore people do not go to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa is a more hard taskmaster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because He cannot acc... He is God! He cannot accept anyone's order. That is God. If somebody accepts my order, he's not God. He's my servant. Or I make him my servant. That is surrender. No more ordering. God is not order-supplier. Although He supplies everything, but not... You cannot order. You cannot order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> According to His will.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ego is another covering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Covering of the ego you surrender, then the soul surrenders automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Covering... Ego is covering of the pure soul. So you are pure soul. That is <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> "I am Brahman. I am not this covering." This covering, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca ahaṅkāra [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are coverings.</div>
