<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (Indian man):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So after my festival of Ratha-yatra the other boys in the Mullicks, they began. My <span class="Italic">ratha</span> was, I think, this much high, very nicely made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> When we had Ratha-yatra in Calcutta we stopped in front of your house and they had that <span class="Italic">ratha</span> decorated in the doorway. And we turned the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> towards the house, and they came out and did <span class="Italic">ārāti,</span> the Mullick family, Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there was good festival, <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> and procession. We all little children enjoyed. And eight days, my mother was cooking different foodstuff for Jagannātha. Then return <span class="Italic">ratha-yatra. Ratha-yatra</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Fifteen days festival.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...upagīyamānāt. Uttama-śloka-guṇānuvādā. Uttama-śloka-guṇānuvādāt. Uttama-śloka</span> is Kṛṣṇa, who is worshiped by selected verses. So <span class="Italic">uttama-śloka-guṇānuvādā</span> is executed by <span class="Italic">nivṛtta-tarsaiḥ. Nivṛtta-tarsaiḥ. Nivṛtti</span> means ceasing; <span class="Italic">tṛṣṇa</span> means material desires. <span class="Italic">Nivṛtti-tarṣair upagīyamānād.</span> So this <span class="Italic">uttamaśloka-guṇanuvada,</span> praising the Supreme, <span class="Italic">uttamaśloka,</span> is done by the <span class="Italic">nivṛtta-tarsaiḥ. Nivṛtta-tarsaiḥ</span> means one who has ceased material desires. He can chant. He can glorify. But it is not for ordinary mundane people. <span class="Italic">Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād bhavauṣādhi chrotra-mano 'bhirāmāt [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">].</span> And this chanting is <span class="Italic">bhavauṣādhi.</span> There is some... [break] ...of holy name or glorifying the Lord is the medicine for this material disease. Material disease means repetition of birth and death. To stop this repetition of birth and death, this is the only remedy. And this is used by liberated persons. So such a nice thing, who can refrain from it? <span class="Italic">Vinā paśughnāt: [SB </span>10.1.4<span class="Italic">]</span> unless one is animal killer, one cannot cease from this business.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive or God is all-attractive. This definition given by Parāśara Muni is a supreme perfect definition. Unless God is attractive, how He can be God? This argument, what do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa showed this attractiveness in full. [break] ...any question you can ask. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> ...expansion or incarnation has the six opulences in full except for Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Kṛṣṇa is cent percent. Next to Kṛṣṇa is Nārāyaṇa. Next to Nārāyaṇa is Lord Śiva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Lord Caitanya did not manifest so much opulence as Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Lord Caitanya appeared as a devotee. How He can show the opulence of Kṛṣṇa? Sometimes He showed. But He was playing the part, <span class="Italic">bhaktākhyaṁ bhaktāvatāraṁ namāmi bhakta-śaktikam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Some of the different incarnations, though, they manifest one of the different opulences or two, like that, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All the opulences, not in full.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So what opulence does Kṛṣṇa have that Nārāyaṇa doesn't have? Those four but, what of the six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The attraction by playing flute, and the <span class="Italic">rāsa</span> dance. In this way there are four principles. That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya caritamrta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But otherwise Nārāyaṇa has all the six opulences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Super-excellent opulence in Kṛṣṇa, by His <span class="Italic">veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣam [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> That attraction is only in Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...scientist, we say the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Yes. He has spent his whole life, twenty-five years, studying so hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he said this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> In 1972. His name is Professor Leakey. He is from, I think, America. And he has found in Kenya one skull two million years old. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. When our book was published?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> This was in about seventy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> 1970 it came out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...you discover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> March 31st, 1970.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? [break] ...civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> You are giving all the information, cent percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...win's theory is that from that lower animals to go to the higher animals, but in the creation we find Brahmā is the first creation. So he is the topmost intelligent man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Is there anything in the Vedic literature which supports Darwin's theory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not Darwin's theory. Darwin's theory is no explanation that whose evolution? Evolution is of the soul. The soul is changing in different bodies, one body better than the other. That kind of evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Darwin has no individual evolution, but the evolution of a species, like, they say, there were horses. And then when they had eaten up all the food on the ground, so they started to get the food on the trees. So their necks became longer. And those with longer necks lived, and the others died. So then there were the giraffes. So they moved like that. "Survival of the fittest." That's his theory. Then the more intelligent animals will live more than the less intelligent. So they will die out and then they will be up to the human. But that doesn't explain why there are still lower species of life, that why are there still animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads) "...we are given the histories of Kṛṣṇa's appearances and disappearances millions and billions of years ago. In the Fourth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that both he and Arjuna had many births before, and that He, Kṛṣṇa, could remember all of them and that Arjuna could not. This illustrates the difference between the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa and that of Arjuna. Arjuna might have been a very great warrior, a well-cultured member of the Kuru dynasty..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In the last part of <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book,</span> Mahā-Viṣṇu says that Arjuna is of the capacity of Nara-nārāyaṇa. So they are <span class="Italic">avatāras</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But as Arjuna he acts as an ordinary <span class="Italic">jīva?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are different types of <span class="Italic">śaktyāveṣa avatāra.</span> So when an ordinary <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is specially empowered, he is called <span class="Italic">śaktya aveṣa avatāra, śatktyaveṣa avatāra, vibhūti. Yad yad vibhūtimat sattvam.</span> He is living entity, but especially empowered. Just like for certain business I give sometimes somebody power of attorney, that "He will do this. He will sign for me." Like that. He is also one of the disciples, but for particular purpose, he is given the power of attorney. In this way when a living entity is empowered specifically to do something, that is called <span class="Italic">śaktyāveṣa avatāra. Aveṣa avatāra. Kṛṣṇa śakti vinā nāhe nāma pracāra.</span> That is explained in the... These are explained in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...śaktya. Mama tejo-'ṁśa-sambhavam.</span> So <span class="Italic">śaktyāveṣa avatāra</span> is not <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span> He is <span class="Italic">jīva-tattva.</span> So the Lord Jesus Christ or Lord Buddha, they come within the <span class="Italic">jīva-tattva</span> especial power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> They are <span class="Italic">śaktyāveṣa avatāras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So Nara-nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi is which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nara-nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi was a <span class="Italic">ṣaktyāveṣa avatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So Arjuna has no constitutional connection with them, but at that time he was equal, by deputed potency. But they are individuals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Arjuna is also... Yes, equal to Nara-nārāyaṇa. [break] ...as Nara-nārāyaṇa. Somewhere, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads) "Kṛṣṇa's knowledge is so perfect that He remembers all the incidences of His appearances some millions and billions of years in the past. But Arjuna's memory and knowledge are limited by time and space, for he is an ordinary human being." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa did not become God by the so-called meditation or mystic power. He has already all this <span class="Italic">yogeśvara.</span> All mystic powers are already there. [break] ...that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Does he also appear through Mahā-Viṣṇu? When Kṛṣṇa appears, it says that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He appeared through Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> But He's still the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He appeared... Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He appeared through Yaśodā, I mean Śacīmata. That does not mean that He has appeared through... The sun rises from the eastern side. It does not mean the eastern side is producing sun. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> When Kṛṣṇa appeared He could assume any other incarnation's form, Lord Rāmacandra, Lord Varāha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But Lord Rāmacandra could not assume Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Lord Rāmacandra also can do. They are all full powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Oh, Rāmacandra is full opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, but Rāmacandra's full opulence was not exhibited. There was no necessity. But it is not that He could not. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So at the end of the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book,</span> when Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna visit Lord Viṣṇu and Viṣṇu calls them incarnations of Himself, that is because Kṛṣṇa appeared through Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> simultaneously one and different. [break] ...covering of the universe. There are seven coverings. Each covering is ten times bigger than the one. Again, the seven elements...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So at night when we look up, everything that we see is within this universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, within this universe, yes. And there are innumerable universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "And beyond that non-manifested matter there is the spiritual kingdom. That kingdom is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as supreme and eternal. It is never annihilated. This material nature is subjected..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...living entities in not non-manifested matter? Are there any living entities in non-mani...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore it is non-manifested. There is no living entities. It is simply covering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So the living entities only appear within the universe, not outside the universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, in the spiritual world there are living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in the covering, in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Is there some part of Lord Śiva that is there in between?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not in between. That is also after that. Sadā-ṣiva. Just on the border, on the border.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> On the border. Before you reach earth, the element of earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. On the border between spiritual world and material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> On the Virajā River? That is where Kailāsa-dhāma is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Are there different Kailāsa-dhāmas like is there any Kailāsa-dhāma in a particular universe also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is. Just like there is Vṛndāvana, similarly, there is Kailāsa-dhāma. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There are many other planets on the earth level?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa only comes to this planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So this is very special planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And every time Lord Kṛṣṇa appears, original Kṛṣṇa appears, does Lord Caitanya appear on the following Kali-yuga?</div>
