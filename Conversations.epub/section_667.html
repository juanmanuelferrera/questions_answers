<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...sometimes they do not. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...cows are all becoming devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is preaching. (to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...not like that. On the head.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Who is the temple commander?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Hari-śauri. His name is Hari-śauri.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is sleeping? He does not see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. I am considering to become the temple commander myself, because it's not the first time this has happened. So many things have gone wrong. Too many. So I think I will do it myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? You will be everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because I cannot find anyone more suitable, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is the suitable man. [break] (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tell him that we had heard he had come and you are free now so he can... Tell him what time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? He went there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, yesterday. No. Saccidānanda went. [break] ...did not know whether he could come or not. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...celebration there. The education minister is also coming. He is going to be the chief guest. So we are going to have this time two big ministers coming to our <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī paṇḍal.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Should we hold an <span class="Italic">abhiṣekha</span> ceremony for Janmāṣṭamī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You know what is <span class="Italic">abhiṣeka</span> ceremony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Bathing ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Should we bathe only the small Kṛṣṇa Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...bathe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> How will you bathe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well, the ceremony would begin about ten in the evening, and we would bathe with water, <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> honey, yogurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi conversation with someone) [break] We shall go. How many? Four? Five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Four, five. Should we have small <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> there also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> If we have <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> we shall have to bring more men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As they will send car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They've sent, as far as I know, one car. So besides yourself, then three others could go. Maybe four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it's so near that we can... [break] Jayapatāka is taking quotes over there, and he'll... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Offset you can take. It will be very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, true. And also then next time we want to reprint it, we can just reprint. It doesn't have to be composed again. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You give me simply hot milk with <span class="Italic">miṣṭi.</span> [break] They're going to foreign country, but once they go they become disappointed and not second time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Someone has gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even this man has gone to Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They generally go to this Middle East it is called? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Far East.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Far East, yes. Because there are many Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> They also go to London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not London. In London the <span class="Italic">kathā vāca,</span> they go, <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> of Tulsi das.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Tulsi das teaching bona fide, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not pure Vaiṣṇava. He has got Māyāvādī touch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> [break] ...Swami from Bombay, his program is to go all around the world and to install the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he tried, and he failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ninety-four-year-old swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gaṅgeśvarānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gaṅgeśvara. I've heard he likes us very much. Girirāja told me in Bombay that he likes us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very favorable to our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a Māyāvādī, but he seems to have a lot of followers amongst the Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Damodar Chanrai follows him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Damodar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Damodar Chanrai from Nigeria.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was in Nigeria recently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He follows him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that if somebody remembers Kṛṣṇa by seeing somebody, that somebody is Vaiṣṇava. He remembers immediately Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That's a test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> [break] ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was handed some leaflets, Cinmayananda Swami, and the printed advertisement on the leaflet wanted "Young men with graduation degree to come to our institute in Bombay. They will be trained up in Sanskrit."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> "To be trained in Sanskrit and philosophy. Then they will be selected by Cinmayananda for preaching all over the world. And if they qualify, then all their expenses and food and clothing will be supplied by the Cinmayananda Mission." Advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This appeared in <span class="Italic">Times of India,</span> it's only in Bombay. It also appeared in <span class="Italic">Times of India</span> in (indistinct). It was an ad just like a professional company's ad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody will be attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are trying to attract people that they'll get a chance to go abroad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be allurement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually by placing such an ad, then all the wealthy people read the ad in the newspaper, and they think, "Oh, they are doing such nice work." So then they go and collect, and they say, "Oh, you see? We are placing the ads." So on the basis of the ad alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That means there is no work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But no educated man, at least in India, is interested any more with philosophy and preaching. No Indian. (Aside) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...preach more, then that would help? Because he was previously a principal of a school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how he is preaching? Have you heard? No, you cannot understand in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We've been told he preaches nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have told him that "You simply read my books and reproduce it. That's all. That will be preaching."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> At least when he speaks to me in English, it's always very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He can memorize Prabhupāda's books and then just speak it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is preaching. Our process is <span class="Italic">anuśṛṇuyāt.</span> We hear from the superior and reproduce it. That is <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ-kīrtanam.</span> Then perfect. If I add something, my own imagination, then it will spoil. No addition-alteration; as it is. As it is you hear from your spiritual master, reproduce. That's all. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa</span> is coming by <span class="Italic">paramparā,</span> so you reproduce. That's all. Even a child can reproduce what he has heard from his father. It is not at all difficult. [break] ...cheap rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we can also do is... I think we should have some publication for one rupee twenty-five paisa. We can just print a small ten-page or ten or fifteen-page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you'll explain in ten or fifteen page?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Otherwise all these books, they cost us about 1.40 for printing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That Hanuman Prasad Poddar, he was producing big books at cheap rates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were all subsidized by Rama..., all his books. And he had no profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Also the paper is given free by Samani.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Yes. They were receiving contribution. Besides that, he possessed agency of Titagara paper mill. So mill rate-immediately 33% less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And I heard all his books were heavily subsidized by Dalmia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Dalmia and many big, big Marwaris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Maybe they can produce your Hindi lectures in pamphlets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if... You can make it cheaper. Instead of three rupees, you can make it two rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like we can have four or five of your lectures for one small book for one rupees, fifty paisa, or one rupee and... If somebody can't afford two rupees... At the present moment we are selling your <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> for two rupees. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...educated, he appreciate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He wants to become your disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> What if the Hindi <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> was in newspaper form? Would that be lowering the standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Then they'd throw it away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can't have a color picture then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> If it was in newspaper form, that would be lowering the standard too much, the Hindi <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> Then they will throw it away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like we have those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We must have quality. Our Godbrothers, they publish tenth-quality papers. Nobody... Nobody cares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Madras we are printing a big Tamil <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad,</span> and one Sindi man, he has donated eight thousand towards the cost. The total cost is eleven thousand, and he has donated about eight thousand. If we can get this... One way we can reduce our cost is by getting advertisements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But that you wish not to do. You'd rather...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Just like this other man has agreed to subsidize the Arabic book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He will pay for the whole thing, not just subsidize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So, so many can be gotten in this way. If they see the books are coming, then they will want to... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...man is convinced, then our printing of books shall be success. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu [Bg. 7.3].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have thousands of people convinced. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācāryopāsanam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> "One should worship <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span>" This is the beginning of spiritual life. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam ācāryopāsanam [Bg. 13.8]. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.</span> These are the injunction. Without taking shelter of <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> nobody can understand anything. [break]...wants <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> it is not given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. Given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not given. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...women's,(?) they try and harass us, they try and cheat us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. Nirnayika just wanted to use their scale, and they would try and cheat him. They would ask him for money just to let us use their scale to weigh the vegetables we buy. So I intervened one day, and then he got so angry that he abused Kṛṣṇa also. These are such big demons, these people. They live in Vṛndāvana but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give them <span class="Italic">prasāda;</span> they will be all right. Yes. Give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The perfect solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We were also demons before we took <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Our preaching means to turn demons into devotees. That is our preaching. If you keep them demon, then your preaching is lacking. Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> today and tell them, "Whenever you come, take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>" (end)</div>
