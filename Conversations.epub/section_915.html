<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are the <span class="Italic">prajāpatis</span> responsible for propagating human species or all species of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Human.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are there different <span class="Italic">prajāpatis</span> for the different species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Brahmā is the origin. [break] ...a class of men, they are called <span class="Italic">vaidyas </span>(doctors). They know all these herb, which herb is medicine for certain disease, and they sell in the market. Every one of these is meant for some medicine. They know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that kind of information given in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. <span class="Italic">Āyur Veda.</span> There is a book. <span class="Italic">Dravya-guṇa.</span> All kinds of herbs, metals, even different kinds of flesh of different animals, they are mentioned. Hundreds of different kinds of animals flesh, how it can be utilized for certain disease, the descriptions are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They use flesh for curing things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They use flesh for curing diseases?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Animal-killing is only allowed when it is absolutely necessary, for medicine. Suppose by killing one animal hundreds of lives are saved, so that is allowed. One preparation is <span class="Italic">chagalaka-ghṛta</span>. It is prepared... A live goat is put into the <span class="Italic">ghee</span> with other ingredients, and that is a good medicine for <span class="Italic">tisis</span>(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> For?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tisis</span>(?) Tuberculosis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They actually cook the live goat in the <span class="Italic">ghee</span>? Maybe we should withhold this science from the Western world for a while.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are expert already. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There were some <span class="Italic">mantras</span> they chant... Just like the sacrifices where they would give new life to the sacrificed animal. They would do the same thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To test, to test the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So that goat would get a new life, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who? No, this is used for medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many, many of the Western medicines are taken from different glands from animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They had an <span class="Italic">Āyur-vedic</span> doctor in New Vrindaban, and he was prescribing <span class="Italic">mung</span> and rice diet for the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's the one who told Rameśvara <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> not to take any sugar when he had hepatitis. He told them that for hepatitis one should take-what was it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Mung</span> and rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Mung</span> and rice, and no sugar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it was taken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Rameśvara was taking, but then he heard that Your Divine Grace said he should take papaya and sugar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sugar candy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> So he immediately stopped the other prescription and followed your prescription.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was beneficial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Rameśvara? Yes, he recovered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I also got over hepatitis following Prabhupāda's prescription.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmakuṇḍa:</span> Prabhupāda, yesterday in this book it said that when a cow gets so old, the most economic solution to do with it is not to waste the meat, that it should be slaughtered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmakunda:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they say that its... When you have this cow that won't give any more milk and its teeth are rotten where its going to die-it can't hardly eat properly-that it's a waste to not use that meat to feed people. It should be slaughtered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. He's saying in a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmakunda:</span> They say that the economically proper thing to do is to kill the cow after it, er, and not waste the meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who will take? When he'll die, who will take his meat? That is also economical. Why don't you give it to the animal-eaters instead of wasting it? Why they bury in the ground? Why? Let it be thrown eating by the jackals or anybody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmakunda:</span> The people should eat their..., the people, then, according to that philosophy, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when man is dead, why the economic calculation is not taken? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Because they think it is animallike.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal or a man, when it is dead, then it is the same value. Is there any difference of value between the animal body and man's body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They think it is barbaric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They think," but you think like human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the animal has no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul or not soul, when the body is dead, is there any difference of value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmakunda:</span> Well, it doesn't seem human to eat a human.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nonsense, the rascal's nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's too horrifying for them to contemplate that they may start eating each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or their family dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Or their grandmother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmakunda:</span> But if it was wrapped up in a package and they didn't know it was the dog or their mother, they could probably eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they can eat by packing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They eat their pets sometimes. I used to have a pet rabbit, and one day I came home from school and my father had killed it and eaten it for dinner. (laughter) He said I wasn't looking after it properly, so he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This business of simply taking economics into consideration...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not. Rascals... How to live, they do not know. Animals. There is a class of men in India, they take, I told you, the dead body of a cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cobblers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Mucis?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Muci,</span> yes. Their business is shoe maker. So when the cow is dead, they take it, they eat the meat and take the skin and the hoof. They make business without any, what is called, investment. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is economic. He gets the skin without any price, and he makes shoes and gets full profit. But that is for a class of men, not for all. Economic gain for a cobbler is not the economic gain for a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> "One man's food another man's poison."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is considered, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that when a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is engaged in the activities of plowing and cultivating, that he has become a <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If there is nobody to help, he can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> As long as he keeps up his brahminical standards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. This is our car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? It says in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, jaya jaya nityānanda, nityānanda-rāma, yāṅhāra kṛpāte pāinu vṛndāvana-dhāma.</span> That means he has somehow achieved the shelter of Lord Nityānanda because He sent him to Vṛndāvana. Is this also true for the residents here in New Vrindaban? They have achieved the shelter of Lord Nityānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
