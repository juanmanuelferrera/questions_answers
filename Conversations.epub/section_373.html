<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> And there were only two Hindu gentlemen in the village and still, the Mohammedans received us and arranged for our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> We felt it was Nityānanda's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> First we were afraid. Haridāsa Brahmacārī told me: "Oh, these are Mohammedans. They'll not help us in any way, nor will they accept <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" But then I said let us go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Everyone will help us. Maybe... In that way sometimes Hindus are also against. It is not the Mohammedans. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's time, even the Hindus were against His movement, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> They complained to the Kazi that "This is not Hindu movement." You see? The <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement. Therefore Kazi had to take steps to stop the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement. So Kazi took step on the ground of complaint by the Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> That's similar to what happened in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> That's similar to what happened...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> ...in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Hindus, they wanted to break our temple, and they broke part of it. You do not know? Oh, how is that? There was a great agitation. By the instruction of the municipality, being bribed by the other party. You, you have not heard that we had so much...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Not heard, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that? It was very well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> In our exhibition booth, we have put up articles about it. India exhibition. Bombay has exhibited the matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma... [break] ...to take evening walk. This part, on the field, agricultural field. [break] ...if you have any land to purchase immediately, then I can ask Mahadevia, He can pay for that. [break] ...Americans without machine, they cannot sleep. They must smell, "Here is a machine." Then they can sleep. There was a fisherman. So at, in the evening... That is still in India. In the evening you can ask shelter from any householder's house. They'll give you shelter. So he came in the evening, "Sir, I want to pass night in your home." "All right, you are welcome." So the fisher basket, fishing basket. "You keep this here, outside, and you sleep inside." So whole day, he was restless. Then whole night, he could not sleep. Then the master said, "You are not sleeping?" "No, sir." "Why?" "Now, because my baskets are kept outside." "What is in the basket?" "No, unless I smell, I cannot sleep." (laughter) So these Americans, unless they smell about machine, they cannot sleep. "Habit is the second nature." For ordinary muscle work, they'll bring so many machines. I have seen. Karandhara was doing. At least that machine must come. (Makes sound like machine:) kat kat kat kat kat kat kat kat. Making hole. That machine is compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Recently, Prabhupāda, I saw one machine for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> For rubbing the nails, there is a battery operated machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Machine for cleansing, so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And for nail rubbing also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. For massaging. Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> They have for brushing the teeth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> You just hold the toothbrush and the machine makes it go up and down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Some scientists, they want to make all the different body parts. They want to give artificial arm, then artificial feet, and they're, they're spending all kinds of money and time making these complicated machinery to do the same thing that the body is doing. And the ultimate goal, these scientists were stating, their ultimate goal was to make a complete human body so that the person never has to die, but he can always change his body just before it breaks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the maker of that machine will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot save himself. He can make a machine which will not die, but he will die. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How much perfect he is, that you can consider, that he's making something perfect which will not die, but he will die. So he's imperfect. So how his machine is perfect? This is common argument. He's imperfect. But he cannot make such machine that he will not die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say in the future they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is, that is a... Kicking, they on their face. That is the only loophole on which we can kick on their face. You see? They are making machine perfect, but they cannot make themselves perfect. Why don't you ask that "Why don't you make a machine that you'll not die? Your machine will not die, I accept. You're so perfect. But why you will die? Why you will die?" What is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> They say that they will get to a point where, when each cause of their death, maybe, say, a bad heart, then they can get an artificial heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, you can get everything. You will do it. But why don't you do it for yourself that you will not die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They'll say, "That's all right. I'm working for posterity so that people who come in future generations..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What posterity. You cannot take help from your machine. What posterity you will take? It is nonsense. You are starving, and you, you want to speak that "I will distribute <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" What is this nonsense? You are starving, and you are proud of distributing food to others. Is that very good reason, a reasonable proposal? What...? First of all, you stop your starvation. Then you can say, "Now I have stopped my starvation. I'll distribute food to the hungry men."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> All the scientists and leaders are all like that. They don't have the vaguest idea. They don't have the vaguest idea...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> ...of anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...call them rascals and fools. They may advertise themselves as scientists, but we take them as rascals and fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Some of them so much want to be God, they're thinking they're going to create life and make bodies and this and that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The only question is that first of all, keep your life. Then you cure another life. Life in you is already there. Now keep it. Protect it by some machine or by some chemical. Then you talk all this nonsense. What do you think, Viṣṇujana Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> At the fairs in the United States, they have exhibits of what the scientists are doing, and one scientist has actually invented a machine... Costs one hundred thousand dollars, and this machine can take the head of a man from his body and keep the brain cells still going, and they expect that this machine, they expect, they haven't done it to anyone because no one will do it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That expectation is always there. Any fool can expect anything. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> But they've done it with goat head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are concerned what you are doing now. That's all. We are not for expectation, future hope. We do not believe in that. Trust no future, however pleasant. It may be pleasant to you, but we don't believe it. You rascals, you can feel, but history shows that after death, no brain works. So we take this simple conclusion, that this brain is useless. So am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> You are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sudāmā Vipra, you are very critical. You can say. Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā Vipra:</span> You're right. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. That's... Svarūpa Dāmodara asked the scientist that, "You are beginning life from chemicals. Suppose I give you chemicals, can you make life?" "That I cannot say." This is their proposal. This is their... All rascals. And they're wasting public money and making other fools. They're going to the Candraloka and this loka, Venus. Simply wasting time. This remark I gave in the newspaper sometimes in San Francisco...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> When they asked about the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. It is simply waste of time and energy. That's all. And in 1968 I wrote that <span class="Italic">Easy Journey:</span> "And this is all childish."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Sputniks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Have you read that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yes. It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can boldly say on the strength of Vedic literature that all these attempts are childish and those who are attempting, they're all fools and rascals. That's all. Now they're silent about moon expedition. They're trying to go to Venus. What happened to moon, moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yeah right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another diversion. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Just wasting money and time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another diversion of attention so that they can exploit public money in that way. And the public is also fooled that they believe all this nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> In the United States, Prabhupāda, the rocks that they brought back from the moon are being displayed in all the different cities. They have little small pieces of the rocks from the moon. And people stand in long lines...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> ...to come and see these little pieces of rock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...how much rascal you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> And they have guards all around the little rocks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> With guns, with guns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, guards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> With guns. So no one will steal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> That is their Deity. They are worshiping. They have guards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They don't pray God, who has made all of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that one, I mean to say, rogue, thief, came to a bank manager. Somewhere in Western countries. And he brought some lotions. So he said that "I shall mix up these lotions. Immediately the whole bank will be blown up." So he became afraid because the scientists do that. So... "So you give me check immediately, two hundred millions or something, otherwise I'll mix it." So he gave him that check. And... Because they were... "It is time bomb. If you call police or arrest me within this time, then it will blown up." So in this way, he took away the check. And after sometimes, he phoned to the police, "This is the situation. Come and help us. Here is a time bomb on my table." So police came. They also took it very carefully in the chemical laboratory. And in the chemical lab, they were also afraid. Then they saw it is glycerin. That's all. Such fools are there. You see. It is simply exploiting the innocent public of their money, hard-earned money. That's all. And if you go to such foundation that "Give us some money for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, printing these books," "No, no. We are not interested in religion. We are for scientific improvement, glycerin."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Rational. They think they are very rational.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Rational. A dog is also rational. But a dog is dog, a man is man. Dog, if a dog is called, "Hut", he's not rational? He'll stop immediately. So is not rational?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rational. One who has got reason. "So this man wants to check me." So he stops. For eating, he has rational, what is his eatable. Dog does not like preparation made with too much ghee. They will like meat, rotten meat, and dried bones. That is rational. "This is my food."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And similarly, hog also, he likes to eat stool than <span class="Italic">halavā.</span> He has got rationality. As you will not eat stool, you will like <span class="Italic">halavā,</span> you have got rationality, then hog has got rationality. He'll not eat <span class="Italic">halavā,</span> he'll eat stool. So where is the want of rationality? Why don't you eat stool? That is rationality. So similarly, he does not eat <span class="Italic">halavā.</span> So where is the difference between you in the matter of rationality? You deny something, he denies something. Where is want of rationality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Bhavānanda has said that in his previous life he had a pet pig, and he used to offer the pig sweet, but the pig would take the sweet and... He would not eat it. He would roll it in dirt. And when it is filled with dirt, then only he would eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> It tasted so bad, he had to have something that tasted good around it so that he could get it down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) It is not for the hog, but a human being... I had a friend. If you give him <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> he'll want little salt. <span class="Italic">Rasagullā</span> with little salt, he'll eat. Without salt, he cannot eat. And my father, he was, at the last stage of his taking, some rice mixed with milk. While eating that, he'll take a little curry also. So it is a taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Paramahaṁsa and Parivrājakācārya were preaching in... Where was that? The East? What is that nation? Siam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Thailand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Thailand. And there they would offer the people <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> but they would put soy sauce on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They would put this bitter sauce on it. Then only they would take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in Burma, my Guru Mahārāja opened a branch. So when they were frying <span class="Italic">puri,</span> the, nice ghee, all the tenants, "Oh! What you are...!?" (laughter) They cannot tolerate. But in Burma, there is a preparation which is called <span class="Italic">nafi.</span> The <span class="Italic">nafi</span> means that a, a big jar will be kept on the door, and whatever animals, insect, cockroaches will die, they'll put in that. And during rainy season, it will be filled with water. And it will be kept for years. Then... And the bad smell was so terrible that if somebody would open the lid, it will immediately create very bad smell. So after some years, they will strain the water and keep in bottle. And when there is festival, they'll supply it in small... That is called <span class="Italic">nafi.</span> And they'll take it very pleasantly. And when they were frying ghee, "Oh! What you are doing, this?!" Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">nānā yoni sadā phire, kadarya bhakṣaṇa kare,<br class="calibre2"/>tāra janma adhah-pate yāya,<br class="calibre2"/>karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa,<br class="calibre2"/>amṛta baliyā yebā khāya</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Karma-kāṇḍa. There are three <span class="Italic">kāṇḍas: karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> and <span class="Italic">upāsanā-kāṇḍa.</span> So <span class="Italic">upāsanā-kāṇḍa</span> is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So instead of accepting this <span class="Italic">upāsanā-kāṇḍa,</span> worshiping the Supreme, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> if one takes to the other processes, <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa,</span> they are <span class="Italic">viṣera bhāṇḍa,</span> they're all poison pots. The result is, if they take to that path, then their, this transmigration of the soul, will continue, and they'll have to eat all nasty things. Because this time you may be human being. And next time you may be hog. So this is <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa,</span> the all poison pots. Simply <span class="Italic">bhakti-kāṇḍa,</span> we have to take. Otherwise our life is at risk. The <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> is also not safe, because their ultimate goal of <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> is to merge into <span class="Italic">Brahman.</span> But there, they cannot stay. Because in <span class="Italic">Brahman</span> simply it is eternal life, eternity, but there is no <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> but we are seeking <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Brahman...</span> Suppose if you are asked that "You will eternally live in this land, will you like that? You'll never die. You'll live eternally, but nobody will come here. Nobody will talk with you." Will you like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No. Nobody would.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the <span class="Italic">Brahman</span> realization is like that. Every living entity, he wants <span class="Italic">ānanda. Ānanda</span> means just like we are walking together, talking together. This is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> If I would have walked alone, it would have been no <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> I do not like. Nobody likes. So <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> means there must be entourage. Therefore <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is with Kṛṣṇa. When we play with Kṛṣṇa, we dance with Kṛṣṇa, talk with Kṛṣṇa, serve Kṛṣṇa, take care of Kṛṣṇa, then there is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> And simply to become one with the <span class="Italic">Brahman,</span> then you will have to fall down again. Therefore <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> is not perfect. And <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> is, you can migrate from one body to another or one planet to another. You'll be <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍa bhramite.</span> You have to wander. And <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> means you merge. That is also intolerable. Therefore unless you come to <span class="Italic">bhakti-kāṇḍa,</span> there is no question of real life and bliss. That is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa,<br class="calibre2"/>amṛta baliyā yebā khāya<br class="calibre2"/>nānā yoni sadā phire, kadarya bhakṣaṇa kare,</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Kadarya. This is <span class="Italic">kadarya.</span> So many nice food. Yes. And before this movement, in Europe and America, they were eating all these <span class="Italic">kadaryas.</span> So many type of <span class="Italic">kadaryas.</span> Their food is only to boil the meat. And when it is boiled, mix with little salt and black pepper and take it. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And after eating meat, then seven hundred years old loaf. Cut it and add with little butter. That's all. And then take wine. <span class="Italic">Bās. Kadarya bhakṣaṇa kare.</span> Now they're eating <span class="Italic">rasagullā.</span> Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> I didn't hear what you said. Now they're eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Previously they were only eating meat. Now they're taking <span class="Italic">rasagullā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So their taste has improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That is our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā,</span> the way back we passed. Do you want to go back yet or around to the end?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? [break] ...In every life, there is <span class="Italic">āvaraṇātmikā-śakti.</span> He'll think that "I am very well situated." Even in the hog's life. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Similarly, even if you are thinking, "Now we have got human body. We are well situated than the hog," that is also mistake. That is also mistake. "I am European, American, I have got so comfortable." Everything is wrong. Because you have to transmigrate. You do not know what is the next life. So what is the meaning of this well-situated. That is the mistake. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You are not sure that you'll continue this life. You'll have to die. You have to accept. So this is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Somebody well-situated, he's thinking, "Oh, I haven't got to do anything with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I am well situated. I am European and American."</div>

And she had to collect woods from the forest and sell in the market. So one day, how do you say, she was praying to Kṛṣṇa, or God, that "Kindly help me. I am in very poverty-stricken." So one day, she was carrying that load of fuel. It fell down. So nobody was there to help him. So she began to cry, "Who will help me?" So she began to pray to God "Kindly help me." And God came: "What do you want?" "Who are you, Sir?" "I am God." "Kindly help me to take this burden on my head." Yes. "All right." From God, she's asking, "Please help me to get this burden on my head." That's all. So everyone is going on, "Let family be very happy, my son be married. He may... Let him pass MA examination." But it is the same thing, "Give me the burden on my head." This is the prayer. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhāḥ.

Now let him engage, whatever service He likes. I don't dictate that "Give me this service." That is also sense gratification. As soon as I'll say that "Engage me in this type of service," that is also sense gratification. When one surrenders fully that "Engage me in Your service in whatever way You like," that is pure devotion. You cannot dictate Kṛṣṇa.
