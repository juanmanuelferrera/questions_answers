<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He said, "We don't know where the ingredients came from, but we're sure that there's..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you talk nonsense? (laughter) That is another rascal. You do not know. Then what is the use of talking nonsense? You do not know wherefrom these ingredients came. That is nonsense. Our answer is, Kṛṣṇa reveals, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">:</span> "The ingredients coming from Me." Now make experiment how the ingredients are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But they say, "Where did Kṛṣṇa come from?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa. Go to... By and by, you go to Kṛṣṇa, and when you don't find Kṛṣṇa's cause, that is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Anādir ādiḥ.</span> He is <span class="Italic">anādi,</span> but He is <span class="Italic">adi.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say the original ingredients for the explosion, then, according to your definition, is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You should never think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes, <span class="Italic">sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> But He has no <span class="Italic">kāraṇa.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span><span class="Italic"> </span>No, no. He is, after all, a student here. That... This is Kṛṣṇa, that you go... Just like you are caused by your father. Your father is caused by your grandfather, his father, his father, his father, his father. In this way, if you go to Kṛṣṇa, then He has no father, and that is Kṛṣṇa. So long you will find another father, then he is not supreme. And when there is no more father, then He is supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is very difficult for us to understand the<span class="Italic"> divya-bhāva </span>of Kṛṣṇa. That is why people are asking these questions because<span class="Italic"> divya-bhāva </span>is very difficult to be understood.</div>

Niskiñcananaṁ mahiyasam. </span>It has to be understood from the same thing,<span class="Italic"> tattva-darśinam. </span>Otherwise it is not possible. You cannot speculate. If you say, as Gandhi said, "My Kṛṣṇa is of my imagination," that kind of knowledge has no value. What you are, your imagination? <span class="Italic">Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā. Parataḥ svato vā. Vidya-bhāgavatavadhiḥ. </span>If one reads <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, </span>then he gets the ultimate knowledge of everything.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why I said, sir, that <span class="Italic">divya-bhāva </span>is very difficult to tell because it is felt by the <span class="Italic">divya-bhāva </span>itself. It cannot be felt by the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span><span class="Italic"> Yes, and therefore Kṛṣṇa said, manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3]. </span>Unless one is<span class="Italic"> siddha, </span>there is no question of understanding Kṛṣṇa.<span class="Italic"> Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3]. </span>Even if he is <span class="Italic">siddha </span>he cannot understand. Out of many of them, one may understand. And they are trying to understand Kṛṣṇa by imagination. Just see the folly. Kṛṣṇa said,</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarisa:</span> Yes, I am feeling well today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are taking yogurt? Give him kicheri and yogurt.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good boy. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> What was that, inquired?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Girirāja was saying something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, yes, the scientist. When the reporter asked him where the things come from, he said he doesn't know but he's sure that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still, he is scientist. He doesn't know. He is rascal, still he is scientist. (laughter) Just see. Contradiction. He doesn't know. Still, he is scientist. One word. He doesn't know anything, but he is scientist. Just see. (Hindi) And we have to hear him-the unfortunate position. We say that "Go for scientific knowledge to a person who knows, who has seen." And this rascal, he says, "I do not know; still, I am scientist." Then what he replied? He doesn't know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> But he's sure that they don't need God to explain it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he knows, how to deny God. That he is expert. And the newspaper reporter accepted this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No. He didn't express his point of view, but you could see he wasn't satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the position. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Then he asked him about the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Future is darkness because these are scientists. He doesn't know; still, he is scientist. Then what is the future? Future is darkness, because a person who doesn't know, he has become leader. The same thing, <span class="Italic">andha yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If a blind man, he becomes the leader of other blind men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Actually it's sad that if someone says there is no God then that means that they...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He's a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, immediately. Anyone who says there is no God, then he, immediately he's a dog. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> No more words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No more words. He is immediately a dog. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If he cannot see throughout the entire universe, from one end of the universe to the other, how can he make the statement that there is no God? He cannot see. And yet they are saying, "I don't know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is reasonable. [break] ...no God, it is spoken by <span class="Italic">pagala,</span> mad, mad.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, sir. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> What is your idea about the secularism preached by our government of India and the policy of secularism? What do they mean by that? That means they say that there is no place for religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dharmena hina paśubhiḥ samana. </span>As soon as there is no religion, the population-animal, that's all. That is going on. Because there was no religion, therefore the government has to declare emergency. (laughter) Because all animals. So they created first animals, then emergency. This is going on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why emergency? If there is human being, then why emergency? All animals. To control the animals you require some special measure. This is the proof that they're animals. Otherwise why? Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is long, long ago said, <span class="Italic">dharmena hina paśubhiḥ samana: </span>"When you give up religion, you are no better than animals."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> What is the harm if I become an animal also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are already animal. There is no question of becoming animal. You are already animal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> So what is the difference between animal and a man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you do not know, therefore you are animal. Therefore you are animal. You do not know what is the difference between man and animal; therefore you are animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Very good. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are good animal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> This is right answer. When you cannot differentiate between man and animal, then that means you are animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you admit it-then good animal. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...who has got this bodily conception of life, he is animal. That is the definition of animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Anyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is thinking, "I am this body," he is animal.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means anyone who is thinking, "I am this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> "I am the"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This body. And in body relationship, "She is my wife, she is my child, she is my countrymen, she is my race." So this is <span class="Italic">dehātmā-buddhiḥ. Yasyātmā-buddhiḥ... </span>"This is my country." In this way one is thinking, and little more religiosity, he is going to holy place and taking bath in the river but not to the person who knows things. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">. Go </span>means cow, and <span class="Italic">kharaḥ </span>means ass. This class of men are grouped among the cows and asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That means they have got no... <span class="Italic">Sthira buddhiḥ neha</span>(?) (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) This is animal civilization. There is no spiritual knowledge. Simply like cats and dogs, they are working hard, eating, sleeping...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Then what should be the spirit of a man? How do you call him a man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he knows that he is not this body-he is soul, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi-</span>then he begins to become. Then his real identity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That means ninety-nine, ninety percent of the people living in the world are practically animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good analysis. Why asses? And you load the ass with as much cloth, washerman, and he cannot move. But he will go on, and the washerman will give, after that, little grass, and he will stand there up to the evening again to be loaded. The ass does not know that "This much grass I can get anywhere. Why I have become servant of this washerman?" Therefore he is ass. He will eat two <span class="Italic">capātīs,</span> but he is working like an ass whole day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes. And he cannot eat more than two <span class="Italic">capātīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. So if the ass, he will eat a little grass, which can be had anywhere, but he is working for the washerman. Therefore he is ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But (Hindi) in the ass... There is (Hindi) some egotism in the human being, but that is not there in the ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that egoism also ass has got. That egoism is there in ass also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But how do you know it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any animal, he knows that "I am ass." Dog knows, "I am dog." Similarly, if you know "I am Hindu," "I am Mussulman"- the same conception. What is the difference? If a dog thinks "I am dog," and if you think that you are Indian, then where is the difference? Simply by changing the name you become very big man? The conception is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That point is not clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is clear. Just like two dogs. He is thinking, "I am dog of this quarter," and another dog is thinking, "I am this dog. <span class="Italic">Gow! Gow! Gow! Gow! Gow!</span>" So what is that? Does that make any difference? Similarly, you are thinking, "Indian," he is thinking, "American." Fighting like dogs. Where is the difference between the dog and this conception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> That point is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Make your mind understand is very problematic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not problematic. It requires the association. Association, teacher, then it will be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Association is most necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Girirāja? The press reporter was not satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No. Then he asked him about the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So what he will...? He does not know. What he'll speak? Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He said the population will go on increasing more and more, and there won't be enough food, so everyone will starve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said, the scientist. Then what your scientific knowledge will help?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, if they drop some bombs they will reduce the population. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very easy. The bomb is also ready. Everyone has got now nuclear weapon, bomb. So the scientists gave the solution. So what is the use of scientific knowledge? This is going to happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually there was one proposal. It was written in the seventeenth century in England by one famous writer, that "Because the population is increasing so much, therefore if we become cannibals, then the population will be maintained."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So who will eat who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, that he didn't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are scientists, big men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So the reporter asked him what were his personal plans for the future. So he said he likes one girl, so he wants to get married, and that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Increase the population. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our plan is the best because before meeting such catastrophies, go back to home, back to Godhead. This is the best. They are seeing the catastrophe, but they have no way to escape. That is the difference between them and ourselves. Jaya. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. </span>[break] ...said that "There is no need of God, but there is need of girl, of a girl." He said that. Then what is the difference between a scientist and a dog? The dog also does not know what is God, but another female dog he wants. Huh? What is the difference? <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then it is proved that he is no better than animal. The animal requires another opposite sex, but he does not know God. Then where is the difference? [break]</div>
