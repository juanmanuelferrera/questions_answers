<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and happiness also. That is my experience. I always said that "You are so much graced by God in so many ways."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> What <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">...yad gatvā, tam eva āgaccha, mama tejo 'ṁśa-sambhavam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why they have got all these things. So God is there. He says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Yad yad vibhūtimat sattvam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, preliminary condition for being in touch with God is there. Because Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna.</span> So they are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That means they are pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">sukṛtinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sukṛti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Otherwise you cannot be <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And, and the result of <span class="Italic">sukṛti,</span> piety, is <span class="Italic">janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī [SB </span>1.8.26]<span class="Italic">. Janma,</span> to take birth, to take birth in nice family. And <span class="Italic">aiśvarya,</span> riches. And... <span class="Italic">Janmaiśvarya-śruta,</span> education, and <span class="Italic">śrī,</span> beauty. All these four things are in America. There every boy, every girl is nicely educated, qualified, artist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That last hundred years' generation of America, very honest people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Extremely honest and extremely righteous. That is why the generation is good. This last hundred years...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...we have been very fond of America. We have been taking great example of Americans during last hundred years. Now they have started degenerating. And that happens with everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> British degenerated; so they must degenerate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Degenerating means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Degeneration must come. (indistinct) It's not so-called revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) they degenerate for others. So that (indistinct) degenerate. We degenerated. So the Muslims degenerated. Americans will degenerate. Somebody else will degenerate. Is that sort of a will? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī,</span> good birth, riches, education, and <span class="Italic">sri,</span> beauty, these are the result of pious activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When you say the present education and all... But this education has created those boys, smoking <span class="Italic">carasa</span> and <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> and <span class="Italic">bhāṅga...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not a university education. That is due to their coming to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are...? They come to India and... They don't do it there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, they come here for spiritual enlightenment, and they meet these rascals, <span class="Italic">gañjā-</span>eater <span class="Italic">sādhus.</span> That is the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they have introduced that in American universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. I know. This is the beginning. They learned this... They thought that this is spiritualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I thought they have taught us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, they imported...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your <span class="Italic">gañjā, gañjā-</span>smoker, these so-called <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> and just like... They have done this. By following these rascals, they are doing it. But they do not know who is <span class="Italic">sādhu... </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And LSD was invented by Indians, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> (indistinct) ...other thing, you know.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was inculcated into the civilization of China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This I know definitely. The hippies, the hippies came to India. The hippies... (Dr. Patel and the Indian men argue in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All these... No, no, no! These are all come from America, sir. If you say like that, I am not going back, sir, day!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no. The <span class="Italic">gañjā, gañjā</span> was not in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That, that is not! But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am speaking. Unless they... (everyone yelling at once)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He says that LSD has been invented in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no! I never said these things!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Don't...! Don't pervert the things! Swamiji, I am very hot on wrong things and lies! This is an utter lie if you even say so... That LSD was invented in America. I am a scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> That is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And it has been used by American boys. And a professor of American university is a friend of mine. And he has been taken horrible things about American boys. And you are talking LSD has been invented in India!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No! I am talking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Don't talk all these things!!!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I am talks, sir... I am only talking of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, this is very wrong. Untruth is as good as a <span class="Italic">daitya.</span> Truth is God. Truth is Kṛṣṇa. Truthfulness. So how it may be? What do you say, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. When we say <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> was started from here, it is God or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Gañjā</span> is God. What is that? In <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> also you'll get that, that, that state of <span class="Italic">samādhi</span> those who get it, they get it. I mean, that is all right. But you said like that, that LSD is invented in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No! I never said LSD... Why you are putting...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. When they started <span class="Italic">gañjā...</span> When they started <span class="Italic">gañjā...</span> They were scientific men. They wanted to make scientific chemicals out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. That's right. That is the right thing. I mean, truth you must have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Don't talk all these things. I cannot tolerate a lie, falsehood of <span class="Italic">banias</span> (?). I am a first-class enemy of falsehood. For truth I am prepared to get hanged. That is very wrong to tell that LSD was invented in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I never said that LSD...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Tum bola</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, no, no, no. That is a... (Hindi) That is the mistake, you see, of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All right, I am quiet. Lay down now. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, actually, this is a fact. This <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> smoking, they have learned from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but <span class="Italic">gañjā,</span> they say, some of the people say that you come in such trance. It's an artificial trance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say also like that!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Hm. These boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... These hippies, they also say that by marijuana... They call marijuana... They call marijuana? Or what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Marijuana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Marijuana. So they learned this <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> smoking... They came here for spiritual enlightenment, but they do not know who can give them spiritual enlightenment. They went to these rascals, <span class="Italic">gañjā-</span>smoker, having long beard...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But there is a great smuggling racket the whole world, Swamiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. When they... I know that Allen Ginsberg. He learned this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he's a great poet. He learned this <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> smoking from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The English boys, the French boys, the Germans, all of them have started in the... They don't come here as hippies. This is an international disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They learned from America. That's a fact. The hippie movement started from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, hippie movement started from America. That means they started first. Not after coming to India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they learned it from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They came here... I have got many students. They came here for spiritual enlightenment, but they learned <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> smoking and keeping high, big beard. You know. There is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsa-āśrama</span> in Delhi. And people contribute them <span class="Italic">gañjā.</span> Not only they, I know... My father, he was also attached to so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> So in Kālī-ghāṭa, there was a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsīs,</span> those <span class="Italic">nāgā-bābās,</span> they smoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">nāgā...</span> He was a regular <span class="Italic">sannyāsī, </span>Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> So my father was giving them the saffron cloth and <span class="Italic">gañjā.</span> People accept it that this is one of the items.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> should be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, so badly impressed. So this <span class="Italic">gañjā-</span>smoking has spread all over the world as the hippie movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I thought that the hippies started from those, this (indistinct) part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The hippie movement was started from India. You see so many <span class="Italic">gañjā-</span>smokers, they are <span class="Italic">sādhus, bābā-sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bābās</span> also, those <span class="Italic">nāgā-bābās,</span> they all smoke...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Nāgā</span> and also <span class="Italic">"sāgā</span> (?)" also. All of them <span class="Italic">gañjā-</span>... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But, uh, but, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? In Calcutta there was a big poet, Girish-chandra Ghosh. Perhaps you heard his name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He started Indian state. He was a first-class <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> smoker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They get in a trance, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that... You have got appreciation for this trance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have got a trance. They get a trance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are, you are smelling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You never condemn it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I won't condemn it if it is good, and if it is bad, I will condemn it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Every bad thing has good also. Some good quality must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So they have taken to it. I don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. That is another thing. Just like opium. Opium, for common man, it is bad. But you are a physician; you can use opium, tincture opium for some certain use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Therefore I say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Same thing, I say. The same reasoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are not physicians. They are ordinary men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So it is bad for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is... What is... What is food for one is poison for another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. That is what I said. The worst poisons have got the best qualification in them for saving lives. That is my point and that is what I was speaking of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when it is ruining life, how you can say it the best?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But it doesn't save the live of someone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I know also. But that is in different use. You cannot take. Just like even a snake poison, venomous, that is also used for saving lives. But that does not mean the snake is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean it is not good for majority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So I am talking of the majority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything made by God is made with an intention of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We are talking of the majority, not of the small minority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All is, everything is made by God with intentions of fulfillment of His <span class="Italic">līlā</span> or <span class="Italic">māyā</span> or whatever you call it. No? And all these, all these <span class="Italic">auṣadhīs,</span> these <span class="Italic">cārās,</span> what do you call, the <span class="Italic">vanaspati-auṣadhīs,</span> they have also venomous poison in them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. <span class="Italic">Vanauṣadhī loke jayate paramam</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So many, so many plants are extremely poisonous. And the poisonous plants are the plants which give the best medicine. As for example, digoxen(?), digitalis, life-saving in heart disease. If you eat a leaf, you will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, just like in your dispensary, you keep everything medicine. But it is to be given to different persons, different medicine. Not that because it is medicine you give to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, what I mean to say is that this pān or <span class="Italic">gañjā,</span> they might have used used by some for a good aim. But it has been misused by a majority of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are innocent people. They have imitated. Our, these so-called <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> says that Lord Śiva used to smoke <span class="Italic">gañjā.</span> That is their... So they have become Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva drunk the whole poison ocean and he kept it here. So you drink one drop of poison. But these rascals, they compare with Śiva, with Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa danced with girls. Therefore we must have." These Māyāvādīs do that. I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are... You have to... I've been... That is what I have, as one of the members of the Vaiṣṇava family, think, that you have to worship God not with the body consciousness, but with the soul consciousness. Then there is no question of Kṛṣṇa dancing with girls. It is a higher soul embracing the lower souls to him. Plain it has been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what we have been taught from our early days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa or what is Kṛṣṇa's behavior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that is right. Even for them. I have no objection if you call me a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> ṝ229 <span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, a Māyāvādī. I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have no objection...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know! I know certainly. I challenge you. In Karachi, there was <span class="Italic">Oṁ-sampradāya.</span> And they were calling for young girls and your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes! That, the Māyāvādī! That Māyāvādī. Because he thought himself that "I am Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is where we differ, Vaiṣṇavas. Because we take <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa's līlā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just you hear me! He thought himself that "I am Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is wrong. Nobody is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am talking that. So he was a <span class="Italic">pākā</span> Māyāvādī. And gentlemen were offering their daughters and their wives to dance.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even in... I do not wish to say. Even this <span class="Italic">Kalyāṇa, Kalyāṇa, Kalyāṇa</span> proprietor, that Goenka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Goenka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was doing that. In Calcutta. Govinda Bhavan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Goenka?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This Goenka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not this Goenka. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Gorakhpur, Gītā Press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a <span class="Italic">pākā</span> Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Gītā Press?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, that Goenka of Gītā Press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. That is because of degeneration of the lower fellows. They are not understanding the real teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have heard about that, about the <span class="Italic">Vallabha-sampradāya.</span> Yes. I do not know whether it is fact. I have heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He belonged to <span class="Italic">Vallabha-sampradāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. I have heard that after marriage the girl was offered to guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> No, that is not in <span class="Italic">Vallabha-sampradāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> No, on ours... Not on Gujarat side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nowhere, nowhere. It is all hearsay. I don't think it would be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> You see it is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Maybe a lower community...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> No, no. Ignorant folk may be decepted like that when they say, "Well, I am Kṛṣṇa, you are <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> So let us enjoy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! Ah!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> So ignorant folks... No, no. I tell you, this is the ignorant folks. That is likely to happen in all religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura punished one <span class="Italic">Viṣikiṣeṇa.</span> I'll tell that story. It is a fact. One <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> came. And he was doing that in the village. And they complained to the police officer. And it went to the High Commissioner. And then Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was that time Magistrate. So the Commissioner knew that he is a pious man. So he entrusted the matter. And it was a long story. I'll tell you some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> No, no. The founders were well-intentioned, but then, after these followers, you see, they only looked to the rituals and not to the spirit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> You know, they forget that this will be <span class="Italic">sukṛtina. Bhakta</span> should be <span class="Italic">sukṛtina</span> first, and then <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> That they forget. So it happens, you see, in all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this thinking, that "I am as good as Kṛṣṇa," this Māyāvāda philosophy has done so much havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The highest philosophy of all is that you must give your ego. So there is no question of "I" remaining there. Even in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> and in <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga,</span> the real <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga.</span> Falsehood, anything can be... Even in <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> also there are rascals, you know, who have done all sorts of humbug things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They are Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were Māyāvādīs. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga...</span> They call <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga.</span> They are actually Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So you can get that degeneration from anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about the philosophy that Kṛṣṇa actually never danced with the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> but Kṛṣṇa's the Supersoul and the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are souls, but there is actually no dancing; that is simply allegory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I say it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And I, I, I own it of Māyāvādī. With your grace, I own it. (Prabhupāda chuckles) I... I... Isn't Kṛṣṇa Supersoul? Isn't you a soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Have you not to worship Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that, that, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...as a soul and not a as a body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That philosophy, that Kṛṣṇa never danced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is wrong. That is wrong. But you have to worship Him as a soul,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...and not as a body. If you worship Him as a body, with a body consciousness, I would not associate. I would not associate with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> That is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ah! But some of these boys have been thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says Himself that <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> He is never this body. He has no distinction between... That has been done, analyzed by Māyāvādī scholar, Dr. Radhakrishnan. When Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">man-manā mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru,</span> he, he, I mean to say, warns, "It is not to the person Kṛṣṇa." That means he is making distinction between Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's inside. So he does not know what is Kṛṣṇa, and he's writing comment on Kṛṣṇa. This is going on. It's going on. (Hindi) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Actually, this is so true, Prabhupāda, because even in the western world, they are Christians. They may be fallen Christians, but they don't think they are Christ. They may be fallen. They may not follow the principles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say "Christ is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they also make mistakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They also make that mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> No, they are mistaken. That is, they understand their position is servant, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This, this philosophy, that there's allegory, that Kṛṣṇa never danced with <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...directly leads to Māyāvādī philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi for couple sentences.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I know also. He spoiled so many girls, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have gone to him so many times in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi) This is the story of before ten or fifteen years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, and now he's at the head of that Gītā Press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hiralal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no, no, no, no. Not that <span class="Italic">Guṇḍā</span> (?). That is different. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but Prabhupāda was speaking of that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> It was Gandhi who said that Arjuna was the soul, that it is all allegory, too. He also interpreted <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he interpreted like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> So same Māyāvādī concept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is also Radhakrishnan who said that battlefield of <span class="Italic">Kurukṣetra</span> is just a battle of soul and something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> The five <span class="Italic">Pāṇḍavas</span> are the five senses, and the... Five <span class="Italic">Pāṇḍavas</span> are the five senses actually. There is nothing like <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> All allegory they want to dismiss it as.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They think that this is all idols.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then you should take your shoe and hit them in the face and say, "This is also allegory of how the material world slaps one." Actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He says that Vyāsadeva is an imaginary character.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in India the Māyāvāda poison has overflooded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (some Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> Just like they import <span class="Italic">gañjā,</span> they import Māyāvādī philosophy also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> Yeah. And all these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Actually the Māyāvādī philosophy was started with Vivekananda. Because I don't find in the Christian faith that they are Māyāvādīs. Their belief is service to God. Of course, they are somewhat Māyāvādīs. But this real strong Māyāvādī was brought from East with Buddhism and Vivekananda's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When I was studying, you know, books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda! (Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All <span class="Italic">śūnyavādīs,</span> Māyāvādīs, yes. Impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> That's why this Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy is so unique. [break] (end)</div>
