<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> ...from Agra came yesterday, Prabhupāda. He wants to live with us. He knows Hindi. He's a teacher. He's a doctor. He's a writer. He's very, very nice. I'll bring him to you today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows English also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> English very well. Very humble and he wants to teach. If he can stay in Vṛndāvana I think it will be very, very beneficial for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Wonderful. I'll bring him this morning if it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> He bows down. He pays <span class="Italic">dandavats.</span> He said, "You're a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> so I must respect. I'm only a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> And he is also very intelligent. He's not just doing it out of sentiment. Very nice man. Older man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is not offered respect, the punishment is that he should fast one day. That is śāstric injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gunarnava:</span> What is the punishment if one doesn't fast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must go to hell. (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> ...also come two or three times before over the months, so I know he is serious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes, he's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is his age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> I think he's about... He's getting on. He's fifty, sixty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right. Then he should retire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes. His wife has, I think, expired, so he has no problem there. And he looked in our <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> and he likes it inside there. He's prepared to live with <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> and so on. Very good man. His name is Mr. Ugrasena. [break] ...much colder today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and it will increase. Yes. In December January it will be very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes. It'll be almost twice as cold. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...middle of January, there will be cloud, rain. You have no experience, last winter, anyone? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes, I have. Still, if we're sincere we'll stay in Vṛndāvana even if blood and stool comes from the sky, if you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you expect that? [break] ...<i class="calibre3">capati</i>, you apply little ghee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> For the guests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And not for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Because it's very expensive and not necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> If you say it is necessary, we will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in this season it is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Very nice. We'll do. That is nice. A little more ghee should be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> A little more grain. Even little grain at night is all right, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you must eat properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes. Then we'll do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And try to keep some cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Accha</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. On the other land. Make a shed immediately and keep some cows. And Viśvambhara, he is experienced. He will help. [break] ...necessary <span class="Italic">vairāgya,</span> there is no need. We don't approve that. <span class="Italic">Yuktāhāra-vihāras ca.</span> What you require for keeping health but not to eat too much. But what is absolutely required must be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> I heard that if you pass stool more than once a day you become a <span class="Italic">bhogī?</span> You are called a <span class="Italic">bhogī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Does that mean a serious devotee should only pass stool once a day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't artificially do that. (laughter) First of all become yogi. Then do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes. Of course, it can only be done by Kṛṣṇa's mercy, but one should at least try for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Don't try for passing stool once. (laughter) That does not make you a yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavananda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā [Bg. </span>6.47]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Antara...</span> Yes. That makes you yogi, not by passing stool. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> That will be it? The scientist and the egg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know that? What is that article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> The one you heard last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. When I was in South America I saw that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> South Africa. There are many factories for chicken killing. So I suggested that the egg, you can analyze, find out the chemicals and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Create one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Create one egg. That was my proposal. So he is going to create. (laughter) He'll explain how to create egg from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> From chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jnana:</span> And make chicken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Calcium phosphate and a little sulphur for the yellow, make some color, and cover it in plastic and put it in an incubator and let a chicken grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> That will be a nice article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> And if they can, they can beat us on the face with shoes, and if they can't, we can beat them on the face with shoes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Well, that's another thing. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...ly regret is that these rascals are going as scientists and big men. Simply talk. They cannot create. It is very simple thing. Put some chemicals together and if you know the chemicals, then why don't you put it? And incubator put, then you don't require to kill so many chicken. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> In Sweden when you go on the street and you preach, "Everybody must suffer here," they don't believe because everybody got an apartment. They have never seen a poor man or a starving cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> But he is himself a poor man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> In Sweden...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he has no knowledge to understand it. Why he is falling down from the skyscraper and killing himself? Why? A poor man commits suicide. So if he is committing suicide he is a poor man. He is a poor man. He falsely thinking that he is rich man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> We're printing now a book there with all the talks according to the scientists and according to the Christian philosophy what was lately in the <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads</span> in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't write anything nonsense. It must be very solid. Otherwise, you'll be laughing stock. What you'll say, it must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> No, just the talks you make. Just your conversations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Your lectures only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That's all right. One must be confident before challenging others. Not that theoretical. Challenge is no good. In all stages he must be able to defend himself from the opposing elements. Then such challenge is all right. [break] We are confident that this soul cannot be manufactured by any material combination. Therefore we can challenge. And I can defend ourself in any stage. [break] <span class="Italic">Cānā, cānā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Channā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">cchana</span> but <span class="Italic">cānā. Cānaka dāhl?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">cānā dāhl,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Cānā dāhl</span> is good nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Chick pea <span class="Italic">dahl</span> for winter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mixed with little <span class="Italic">uraḍ dāhl,</span> then it will be very palatable and very beneficial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> For at lunchtime?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Yes. Very good. [break] ...<span class="Italic">dāhl</span> will give you as much energy as eggs will any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Aksayānanda:</span> Practically the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It contains protein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Actually it's a wonderful challenge. This big, big scientist, big, big brain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big, big monkey. (laughter) "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> And we walk in and put an egg in front of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know this? <span class="Italic">Baro baro bandolel, baro baro peṭ laṅkā dingate, matakare het.(?)</span> (laughter) This translation was done by one big professor, of President's College, Professor Rowe. He was a big professor in the President's College. So these professors required to learn Bengali, so he translated, "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping melancholy." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> There's some countries in Europe where they have absolute laws against selling books in the street. In these countries do we have to make something secret to sell your books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Secret? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> Because otherwise they would immediately put you in prison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where? Here in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> No. In Europe, like in Switzerland. But when we go there for selling books people take them like anything, but you have to hide before the police very carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why don't you take permission from the court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> No. It's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Have you applied?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> They have very strict laws. It's also been applied for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to prove: "This is very important book of knowledge, so allow us a special."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> It's especially different if foreigners try to sell a book there. And we have... Like in Austria we have no Austrian devotees there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They think it's an invasion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> Yes. We used to go there sometimes, and it was very good. People took many many books, but sometimes they caught us, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if they caught, go to the jail and when there is trial you should explain that "This is very important book. The government should allow to sell."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> If the policemen liked us, but the law is strict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to take defense from the law. You present in the court the professors' opinion, how they are giving standing order. Why the state should restrain distributing knowledge? Do they want to keep their men in darkness? You have to preach like that. [break]...University is the most important university in Europe. They read our books. They order standing order. So why this loafer state prohibit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Alanath:</span> ...these explanations, they always argue, "If we allow you to sell your books, then we must allow everybody to sell on the street."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But you must consider the importance of... [break] Everybody submits application for becoming high-court judge. Will it be granted? There must be discrimination. [break] Thank you very much for your kindness. Yes. I am very pleased. Thank you. (end)</div>
