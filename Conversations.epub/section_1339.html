<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you are going to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What are we going to do? What am I going to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, the real factor is Your Divine Grace's desire. I mean it seems like... As your disciples, our duty is to help you fulfill your desire. It seems like your desire is to die in Vṛndāvana. But it's very hard for us to execute that service. It's very hard-because we love you-to assist you in dying. It's a paradox. You want to die in Vṛndāvana, and we want you to live, and yet we have to do whatever you want. I mean, the <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he is giving some... He feels a little confident. Probably from medical point of view, there's no doubt, he has far superior knowledge than many of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Viśvambhara has not yet...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Viśvambhara has not come yet, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean for the past few days you've been saying that you want to live. Now suddenly you say that you want to die. Maybe that's simply to discourage us from... Because you feel too weak now. There's so many conflicting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Do you understand? He's saying that "As a physician, in this condition, I wouldn't advise you to go. But if you desire to go there, then I have enough confidence in my medicine, and since you have the will, so I can assure you I can take you over there safely. Now it's up to you whether you want to go or whether you want to stay." He's saying that if you stay here for ten more days, then you'll become strong enough and you can travel. And he's willing to come back again after about a week, and then he'll stay here for a day or two and then take him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think that's a good idea. Don't you, Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda is saying that... Śrīla Prabhupāda wants to stay here, but we want him to take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He wants to stay here, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Water intake, liquid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How much urine has he passed since six o'clock this morning? Six o'clock this morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Two hundred and twenty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The whole day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, since six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the whole day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> The whole day it's 320.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Just translating what the doctor is saying. If there's any risk, Prabhupāda, in traveling, then you shouldn't take that risk. The doctor will come back here next week and then we can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the morning the symptom was that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying, from the treatment point of view, it's best if Śrīla Prabhupāda stays here for ten more days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tell him that the only reason we had any reservation about that was because if some side effect develops, then he is not here to help, and we have to take the help of this other person, who we do not trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying that now his medicine started working. So he'll give one day's medicine, and he's confident that that medicine will work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One day's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Seven days. And apart from that, he's saying that that boy, he has got confidence in him that whatever instruction he gives, he will follow. He is going to follow that, not like other physicians. He wouldn't try to administer his own medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but supposing there's a symptom which he has not predicted at this time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He says that nothing will happen. He's saying that the main thing... He found out the main defect in the body. He's saying that if anything is wrong, then we can ring him up and he'll come immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Next time, when he comes, make arrangement to stay for a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Say, at least about a week, so that he can stay here for about a week. This time he came absolutely unprepared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Turn me this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara is here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Mahārāja, do you have the urine report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can you go in my file under "M"? There's a folder, an envelope, a big envelope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Prabhupāda should not speak to anybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should not speak to anybody. Well that's all right with me, but whether Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Don't allow guests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about this <span class="Italic">parikrama?</span> Prabhupāda feels that that must go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> If he insists on going on <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> he can give a special medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's pretty insistent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is this all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That we'll wait here for another week to ten days, and Shastriji will give us medicine. The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will give us medicine, and you can take it for another week or so. After a week's time he'll come back, and then, after a few days, he'll take you to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least at present this decision will be good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This decision is good. He says that you should not do so much talking, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll not talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> For about ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I've never seen this possible, though. (laughter) You always speak of Kṛṣṇa. That is your life and soul, <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.</span> He says if you insist on going on <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> then he will give you a little medicine which will help you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Parikrama</span> must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Four times? That's all right. Three times around, into the temple, and one more time. That will be nice. Four times. Is that all right? Will that be all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have given four times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're doing a lot more than four now. We do about ten. Smara-hari knows because he carries you. (laughs) So then we'll make this program, Śrīla Prabhupāda? And you should keep making the effort, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to get better. Kṛṣṇa may desire for you to get better, Śrīla Prabhupāda. At least it is our duty to pray like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi) Telephone... (Hindi) ...any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... In Bengali there is such thing, "When you hesitate, don't do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we also sometimes feel that when there's a hesitation, it seems like the Supersoul is giving indication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he has not also come? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhagatji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has not come yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when he will come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I am also beginning to wonder. He was supposed to come by at least four or five o'clock. I'm sure he'll have a good reason, but until he comes I cannot speculate on why he's late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be late. The other person, whether they will come at night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, that's probably why he is late, because they would only come at night. That's my... Last time this was also done at about this time, Śrīla Prabhupāda. These men work all day in the court, and they can't come until the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And suppose he does not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, if he does not come, then I'll have to find out why he didn't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then you will have to postpone. They'll have to postpone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, if they don't come, then certainly we'll have to postpone this signing, because they won't be here. Are you feeling up to signing anything tonight? I don't think so. You feel a little too much... You can do? Let us see if they come. I think they're going to come. Of course, it is getting pretty late. Anyway, we'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Quarter to nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In any case, you're not at any loss. You're laying here. Just I think now I'll turn off the light. Do you like some little <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span> Singing? You haven't been having <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> lately in your room very much, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Anyway, if you like, we'll just keep it quiet here and turn off the light. Would you prefer that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Light you can keep. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have to give the key to the door. I keep the door locked when I'm not in the room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> (whispering) I made two members today for the Institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If you stay longer on this planet, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that will make this movement stronger. That is the real reason for living longer. 'Cause you are a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, you have no personal desire. This is Kṛṣṇa's movement. If you stay longer, then this movement will become stronger and stronger. Simply by your presence the devotees become inspired and they work much better. We can understand that there's nothing to lament if you were to depart, because you're always going to be with Kṛṣṇa. But we would have to lament from our own point of view that we would lose you, at least in the way that we have you now. And the whole world would lament because this movement might not be as strong if you were not present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then make this arrangement, one week or ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are doing that. We have already agreed to that. Actually I could see from the very beginning that that's what we're going to do, but sometimes I feel it is my duty to give good arguments for some opposite opinion just to see both sides. Ultimately we are prepared to be with you wherever you want to be. To us that is home. That is our great pleasure, to be with you. So we're making that arrangement, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] (offers obeisances) <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think that without finishing this business we shall go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Without finishing the business of these, this legal business? Oh, yes, this legal business is not what would keep us here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how it will... How it will be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean it can be executed in Māyāpura as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mr. Das, our friend from Calcutta, can come. It's pretty much now... It's already drafted, and... It would just have to be redrafted again on new stamp paper or the words would have to be changed. It would have to be retyped on stamp paper from Bengal side. The basic writing is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means unfinished despite unfinished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughs) Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? It is past nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So maybe this is the reason we're not going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Even if we decide to go, that means despite unfinishing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I really don't feel that this would be enough of a reason to stay here. The whole consideration of whatever we do is your health. That is the major consideration. Our going was on account of your health; our staying now is on account of your health. These other things may be done or not. That doesn't matter. I work all day doing all of your other businesses only because I know your health is well looked after. Otherwise, if I thought it wasn't, I would drop whatever else I'm doing and simply do this, take care of you here. There's so many qualified men doing that, so I don't... I'm engaging myself in your other businesses. Otherwise the main thing is that first of all you should be..., we should try to help you to get better. And if I say, "If you want to take rest, you take rest and don't be worried that this business may not get done tonight." That is not the issue at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how is that they did not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is very strange. I must admit I'm very surprised, very, very surprised. I think the only possible answer to it can be that the work itself is difficult work, plus there must have been some other works that either the lawyer had to do or the notary had to do, and so it just could not... I mean after all, this was very, very quickly done. When we decided that we were going to go, it was only on Monday. That means yesterday morning that we decided that we were going to leave. So I mean from yesterday morning until tonight is practically not even... It's hardly enough time to do the legal work that we wanted to do. It was a real strain. Actually it would have been very surprising if we do get it done by tonight. That would be very surprising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think. It is past nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You don't think they'll come now. No, I also don't think. I mean it's not good etiquette to come at this hour for business. It's nearly nine-thirty, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean I don't think that... If you'll permit me to request them, even if they do come now, that we do it on another day, then I would prefer to do that. Oh, I hear Bhagatji. (goes and returns) So they're all here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So we can go to Māyāpura now. (laughs) So I better... First I'll have to go through all the documents and see that they're in order. Then I'll bring them in here and we'll finish this business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let us go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughs) You want to go to Māyāpura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you are saying, I'll go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I mean you guide us. As you say, we will do. There's no... The doctor advises, "Better to remain." His medical opinion is that you should wait here for another ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He said the only reason... He said, "However, if you really feel that you want to go," he says, "I guarantee you that there will be no risk." That he promises. If you want to go, there will not be risk. But from a medical point of view he says, "I advise you to get stronger before making the trip, because it will be easier."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that's our program. We're going to wait here ten days. After seven days, doctor is coming back. <span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span> is coming back. He'll also by that time have arranged so that when he comes he can stay even up to a week if necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I'll get some strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's his point, yes. He feels confident that you'll get strength. Is that all right? I'll go now and... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So somebody else come near me. Tamāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If somebody has come from Delhi, in that car could not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Someone has come from Delhi. The cars came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But... No, no. It could not come in time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> They couldn't come in time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The cars only came here by four o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it seems like it was Kṛṣṇa's desire that we didn't go. I was pretty shocked when I saw that the cars only arrived by four o'clock in the morning. There was no way that we would have been able to go on time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is to be done now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is to be done now? Well, we're going to stay here for ten days or so, and you'll get better. When you get stronger, then we can attempt this trip. We have to hope that you'll get stronger now. Did you take all the medicine, Bhakti-caru, from the <span class="Italic">kavirāja?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. He made all the medicines till eleven o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall wait. We shall wait.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. No, that was the best program, to wait some time. We were feeling a little bit happy to get this good <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> so naturally we were thinking to stay where he could give you more close attention. But he also felt that to wait for some time was best. Did you pass a comfortable night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As usual. Bhavānanda was reading <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Now Jayādvaita, you read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> I can read, or Akṣayānanda Mahārāja is here with the report about the program last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Where is Akṣayānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They enjoyed... We showed them the New Vrindaban film, Hindi. They enjoyed it very much. Also they asked us to speak. They said, "But don't speak anything about the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. They said, "You can speak what you like about ISKCON, but we know all about <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Don't speak anything about <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Tell us about the progress of ISKCON." So I read out how many books have been printed and distributed since Your Divine Grace started ISKCON, how many farms you've established, how many centers, how many devotees all over the world and like that. They're very dry. But nonetheless, the film was so nice that they were very much impressed by it. They took <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>. They enjoyed it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Don't speak of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. "<span class="Italic">Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna,</span>" but "Don't speak of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span>" It's foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the danger is <span class="Italic">māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Vṛndāvana is full of Māyāvādīs.

[break] They are coming to our Vṛndāvana temple, Bombay temple. What is their purpose? They may occupy it? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they can't occupy it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to be very careful. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Akṣayānanda? And Tamāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they're not going to get in. From now on we're going to have a sign on all of our temples, "No Māyāvādī Meetings Allowed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is clearly written, <span class="Italic">māyāvādi-bhāṣya śu...</span> Sixth Chapter. Hm? The Sarvabhauma...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> One sixty-nine.</div>
<div class="Verse">jīvera nistāra lāgi' sūtra kaila vyāsa<br class="calibre2"/>māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">That's Sixth Chapter, <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā,</span> verse 169. "Śrīla Vyāsadeva presented the Vedānta philosophy for the deliverance of conditioned souls, but if one hears the commentary of Śaṅkarācārya, everything is spoiled." Shall I read the purport, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Purport: "Factually the devotional service of the Lord is described in <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> but the Māyāvādī philosophers, the Śaṅkarites, prepared a commentary known as <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya,</span> in which the transcendental form of the Lord is denied. The Māyāvādī philosophers think that the living entity is identical with the Supreme Soul, Brahman. Their commentaries on <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> are completely opposed to the principle of devotional service. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore warns us to avoid these commentaries. If one indulges in hearing the Śaṅkarite <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya,</span> he will certainly be bereft of all real knowledge. The ambitious Māyāvādī philosophers desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, and this may be accepted as <span class="Italic">sāyujya-mukti.</span> However, this form of <span class="Italic">mukti</span> means denying one's individual existence. In other words, it is a kind of spiritual suicide. This is absolutely opposed to the philosophy of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga</span> offers immortality to the individual conditioned soul. If one follows the Māyāvādī philosophy, he misses his opportunity to become immortal after giving up the material body. The immortality of the individual person is the highest perfectional stage a living entity can attain."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who were..., was present all through in the meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Rāma-Kṛṣṇa Bajaj was there. Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you were there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Well, last night they didn't speak anything. They just heard our film and lecture. That's all. They didn't speak anything last night. Actually they are very impressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who was impressed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> All the people. They all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda's asking about the Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs,</span> Puruṣottama Gosvāmī, Viśvambhara Gosvāmī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Oh, I see. No, they were not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but they were there in the afternoon. You didn't see them, but they were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Oh, I see. We didn't stay all through in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda's point is that all of the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> of Vṛndāvana were attending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> What did they say to Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they're attending, Bon Mahārāja, so that means the whole of Vṛndāvana has become Māyāvādī, because they're all attending this meeting. Our men should not attend this meeting any more, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just see the, how they have functioned. It is our place. We should guard. So, and all the men were accommodated in their room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They could all fit in the meeting room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who was presiding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> The Aurobindo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That guy's a <span class="Italic">pakka</span> Māyāvādī. That Aurobindo man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He had a big argument with Brahmānanda. Not a big argument, but he was challenging Brahmānanda that "Kṛṣṇa means the divine consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is not a person. He is the... It is divine consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I have a plan, Prabhupāda. Myself and Bhakti-prema Swami can go there and sit, and if we hear any discrepancies, if we are given a chance afterwards, which we can arrange, to speak something, then we can rectify-in a gentlemanly way, of course. We can rectify. If we sit there, at least we know that they'll be careful what they say. And he can catch any finer points that I would miss, 'cause it's all in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are speaking in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Everything's in Hindi, the whole thing. No English whatsoever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then there's no chance of our men becoming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Our men can't understand anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a good advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But for the purpose of maintaining our proper position, we can sit there and hear what they're saying, and when an opportunity is there we can rectify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think Bhakti-prema may agree with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, no, he's... No. No, no</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He used to be a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. But he understands fully this philosophy and accepts it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the position. The whole Vṛndāvana is full of Māyāvādīs. We have to be very, very cautious and careful. I was there. That Brahmānanda protested against that Aurobindo. And then "Don't speak of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's what they told him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They shouldn't speak of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> They should speak of whatever other thing they want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then why call it <span class="Italic">Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That's Prabhupāda's premise. He's establishing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The actual establishment of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is being done by Your Divine Grace. They should admit that "We have our philosophy, but as far as <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> goes, Śrīla Prabhupāda is establishing it all over the world. We have something else, our own idea." They can say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now find out the way how to stop this class of men speaking in our halls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's not difficult. We simply... We conduct our own meetings, that's all, Bhaktivedanta Institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, one thing is that in Bombay... I mean we really don't have a very attractive hall here, but in Bombay we have the most attractive air-conditioned hall of any place that has a religious temple. All of these people will want to speak in our hall. Not only these people will want to speak in our hall, but all of the nonsense theater people will want to perform there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we must charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even if we charge, they're going to speak nonsense. If we don't mind speaking nonsense, then it's all right. Otherwise, just like Shubhalakshmi, she may want to give some concert in our hall as a benefit. But she's going to simply sing nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bhavānanda? Where is Bhavānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if they pay, we shall allow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I don't think so, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Just like yesterday, I was noticing in their afternoon meeting, they had microphone, and you could hear the speakers outside. I was thinking that this Māyāvādī... Someone is speaking Māyāvādī philosophy, it's polluting the boys. Even you don't understand Hindi, the sound vibration itself is polluting. You once told me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that to even hear Sanskrit <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> from the mouth of a Māyāvādī, it will poison you. Even you don't understand, just the sound vibration coming from that source is polluting. So what is the necessity for us to rent out our facility to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Well, the point is that we have not built these temples for profit-making basis. We have built these temples to demonstrate to the world an ideal, perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if we are going to allow these people to come here, that means we're compromising. Then we should have gone into business...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like to take advertisement in the magazine. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It's the same thing. We're trying to make something ideal. We don't care if anybody does join or doesn't join, but our business is to show the perfect ideal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jayādvaita?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> I agree. This...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like our <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine. For a while it was becoming very compromised. Actually it was becoming a little compromised. And just because we wanted... The editors were thinking that they should make it more popular, more acceptable. But our conclusion of all the GBC men was: "Popular or not, we are trying to present the ideal for the topmost men. There must be some ideal institution in the world." So we should keep it pure. And those who want the pure product, they will come and take. And others, at least they will know this is pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Everybody else is already a hodgepodge, so they'll allow anyone to speak because they don't have any scruples. But if we are very strict, if we don't allow anyone who's not strictly following...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Brahmānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Brahmānanda? Brahmānanda is resting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, I am on the deathbed. I may go away at any moment. Then... Now it is up to you to give protection to the sanctity of our institution. Who else is there from the GBC?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara, Jagadīśa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's not here right now, but they are here in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has gone to Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He came back last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So think over. I am unable to do now. I can simply give you warning. It is very dangerous. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> We have so many experiences that someone associates with these people and he loses his status.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can warn us that "Don't speak of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span>" and why shall I allow them to speak? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> That is such an insult, especially it's our facility. And as soon as you rent out to people, then you are compromised that they can tell you not to speak of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> at their <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> conference in your hall. And you have to listen because they're giving you money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because they're paying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It's outrageous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. I mean I'm more concerned about Bombay, because there in Bombay I feel that... I don't think that there's a proper understanding on the part of some of the leaders there about the danger of this. I think that the leaders there are not very clear on this point. I'm a little worried about Bombay. I think that they're... They're going to compromise. There's a danger for compromisation there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> To be popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. To be popular and profitable, they're approaching it on a very businesslike basis. And also the other point is that they're afraid that... In Bombay they've made this hall, such a beautiful hall. So they don't want it to lie vacant or empty, and they just can't think of what can be done inside that hall every single day of the year. It's a fact that hall should be used every day of the year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> By us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By us. But since they feel that there's not going to be any constant use from our side, they're thinking that it doesn't make sense to have built and spent so much money on such a good hall and not utilize it daily, which from the business point of view is a fact. But that means that you're going to have to invite all kinds of semi... It's not even Kṛṣṇa conscious. I wanted to say semi-Kṛṣṇa conscious, but they're going to have to invite different theater people, entertaining people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> So the Kṛṣṇa conscious solution is to utilize the hall every night for our own purposes. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is unlimited. There's so many dramas, so many lectures, so many symposiums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, suppose you construct some house and rent out. Then they can do as they like. So similarly, if that hall is made, constructed for making some money, then the money will not come if we don't rent out to the cinema actors, actresses. It is just like... What is called? Village house. Hm? The hall is called? When one pays, marriage ceremony... For making some money you have made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that why we made that hall, for making money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise what you will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, originally you had intended that that hall would be used for Svarūpa Dāmodara's scientists and for our theater group and things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but are you going to have every day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I know that they won't. They cannot do that. I mean practically they won't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It's possible, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it would have to take a tremendous endeavor on the part of our movement, and our movement is not... We're not geared to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is like tenant house. So whoever pays to your satisfaction, you give him for one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think it is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Well, then that makes it very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it will be a source of income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, it will be a big source of income. They'll pay a lot of money to use that hall. Not only that, once you let them use the hall, they'll book all the rooms in the hotel at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are going to do some business, earn some money, you'll have to allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> But how that will affect the atmosphere and Kṛṣṇa consciousness of the temple? It's not that the theater...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, atmosphere... Suppose there is temple, and there is the park and other houses, and they are already polluting the atmosphere. You cannot stop it. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> All over our movement we have temples, and then next door there's some nonsense place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You cannot check the atmosphere all around. That is not possible. (pause) So when you described the number of books, what did they say? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They said it was very nice. They said they were very impressed with that, and that you are doing the greatest work. They... Superficially they say all these things. They must.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They haven't even published one book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They must say these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Of course, Śrīla Prabhupāda, another view is that we've constructed such attractive facilities here, and the purpose is to attract people to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if we let out this auditorium in Bombay and here in Vṛndāvana, so those people will come. They may be Māyāvādī... Actually everyone is Māyāvādī today. So it's a good opportunity for preaching if we're strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching means to convert Māyāvādīs to Vaiṣṇava. Otherwise where is the need of preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Preaching also means risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No risk. We take money from them. So we get some money. That is our gain. So anything, do very carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you said we should have a sign, "No Māyāvādī Meetings Allowed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If this is allowed free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Well, this wasn't free. They're paying for being here. They're paying to be here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're paying to hold their program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No gratis lecture allowed. If they pay for, they will talk all nonsense, (laughter) and we don't care for it. These are the considerations. That's all right. Turn me this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Prabhupāda, you should take some rest now, I think. You've been talking a long time. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Read it. From anywhere in particular? "The Killing of the Demon Pūtanā." Should I read the chapter summary? "A summary of the sixth chapter is as follows: When Nanda Mahārāja, following the instructions of Vasudeva, was returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death. While Nanda Mahārāja, the king of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva's words concerning disturbances in Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Hari. Meanwhile Kaṁsa sent to the village of Gokula a <span class="Italic">rākṣasī</span> named Pūtanā who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is the danger of such <span class="Italic">rākṣasīs.</span> But since the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Pūtanā could accept nothing there but her own death." Here's some other books, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Should I show you some more? <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Kapila, the Son of Devahūti.</span> (devotees exclaim)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You wanted this book. You gave the lectures in Bombay on Kapiladeva's teachings to Devahūti.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hand caught.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's a new book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's called <span class="Italic">Preaching is the Essence.</span> "His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda." It says, "Compiled by Rāmeśvara dāsa Swami and Śubhānanda dāsa Brahmacārī." It says, "A note of explanation. Every word of the text of this book is taken directly from the books of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder-<span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. The text appearing in boldface type is Śrīla Prabhupāda's translations of verses from the Vedic literatures. The text in regular roman type consists of excerpts from His Divine Grace's summary studies and purports. Contents in brief: 1) The mission of the Lord-to give all living entities the benediction of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. 2) It is the duty of the devotee to preach." Each one of these subjects, then they give verses or purports.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> All about preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, a devotee can use this book to learn these verses which substantiate the following points. These are the points. "3) Preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest welfare activity. 4) Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be distributed to everyone without restriction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many copies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This was printed strictly for the devotees, two thousand copies only. It's meant as like a preaching weapon. "5) One who preaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness is dear to Lord Kṛṣṇa and is protected by the Lord. 6) Kṛṣṇa empowers the preacher. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement spreads by the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya. 7) Preaching is based on compassion. 8) The preacher should practice tolerance. 9) To be effective in preaching, the preacher must be pure and follow the regulative principles. 10) Conditioned souls benefit from hearing Vedic literature, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-kathā.</span> 11) The future of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement." Should I see what it says under that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The future of this movement? Page 88. "The future of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can save the world. '<span class="Italic">Kirāta, hūṇāndhra, pulinda, pulkaśa, ābhīra, śumbha, yavana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18] and the <span class="Italic">khasa</span> races, and even others who are addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.' Purport: 'The above-mentioned historical names are different nations of the world. Even those who are constantly engaged in sinful acts are all corrigible to the standard of perfect human beings if they take shelter of the devotees of the Lord. Jesus Christ and Hajrat Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on the behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe. And from the version of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the Almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world, because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general.' " Then it gives so many other quotes. "Kṛṣṇa consciousness will spread all over the world." Then it quotes from the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> " 'The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will inundate the entire world and drown everyone, whether one be a gentleman, a rogue or even lame, invalid or blind. When the five members of the <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva</span> saw the entire world drowned in love of Godhead and the seed of material enjoyment in the living entities completely destroyed, they all became exceedingly happy. The more the five members of the <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva</span> caused the rains of love of Godhead to fall, the more the inundation increases and spreads all over the world.'

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says here, "It is clearly stated that the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was never meant for the demoniac persons, who would dissipate its value for no one's benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> but almost all of them are not according to the authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This spirit is demonic because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> in English as it is received by the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> disciplic succession system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> accepted as it is, is a great boon to humanity. But if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time."</div>

If you want, you can also become a leader. We have no such thing, that 'Here is leader.' Anyone who follows the previous leadership, he's a leader. 'Indian,' we have no such distinction, 'Indian,' 'European.' "</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They can help in something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's their idea, that they should have somebody. It's very implicating though. I'll tell you, I wouldn't put anybody on that committee, really. It's very implicating. As soon as you go to that coordinating meeting, you're obligated to give them all kinds of facilities. They have nothing that we want, factually speaking. They have nothing. They have not helped us. (to Brahmānanda:) No, they have not helped us. You're listening to what they say, but I know the facts. I know they haven't helped us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tactfully deal with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa did nothing. Don't get involved with them, because you'll get so obligated. It's better to say that "Prabhupāda said that simply he will be on the coordinating committee. He doesn't want anybody else to be on for now." I'll say like that. For now, you don't want anybody else. You are present, so that you alone will be on it. I like that.</div>

I was standing on the other side of the door. I could not... I didn't like it, to be leaving you alone like that. We're trained always to be with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Very carefully deal with them. They are trying to come into the institution to grasp the power gradually.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I'm just thinking about looking... I want to read our memorandum, because as far as I remember, the life members have the right to vote in our Society. That may be one way. They may read the memorandum and see that "We can vote." Then, by doing some politics, they create some difficulty by voting and put one of these materialistic men in charge. Good reason to remain with us, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They won't do anything while you are present. It's better that you should remain with us. Then they won't be able to do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa will protect you. Try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They're very politically minded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're not at all interested in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. And that purport I read was perfect. That purport that I read was all about doing some nonsense interpretation. That's exactly what they do. Unwilling to admit the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, but enjoying the property of Kṛṣṇa-that's their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They do not believe in God.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They have just... Śrī Nārāyaṇajī and Rāma-Kṛṣṇa Bajajī have just left. I just saw them off. They are very happy. All the members of the committee, of their committee, they made a prayer that Your Divine Grace would have long life and good health. And regarding their meeting, I simply put their... They had the loudspeaker outside. I just put it inside so no passerby can hear, and they just did their business and left. They had no problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What resolution they passed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I do not know. (Prabhupāda laughs) I could not attend it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I had to go... Next door we had some work with one <span class="Italic">bābājī.</span> We had given him money last year, and I had to get that money back for his land. They're given a security.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. We were using his land for a sewer, water waste. So we had given him two thousand rupees' security. We were going to buy that land. You remember once Your Divine Grace came to see it. We were going to put all that waste water and make a garden and all this. So now we have connected with the municipal sewer line, so there's no need for that land, and that problem is solved. So we took the money back that we had given as a security. I have been there for the last two or three hours, so I was unable to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have returned the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, they have returned it. Bhagatji was there. He arranged everything. He is <span class="Italic">pakka bāniyā.</span> He has arranged very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about the gate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's going on. Construction is going on. Saurabha Mahārāja came yesterday, and he has given that idea. He had some objection before. He's clarified that objection. It was an architectural point, just for the beauty. So he's clarified that with the engineer, and it's going on now. I haven't had time, Prabhupāda, to talk to the members-some of the members are still remaining-about their conference, because I had to go for this work. But I'll go now and meet some of these gentlemen, get some idea what is their aims and objectives and resolutions. Otherwise, unfortunately, I could not be present there. But I'll give you a report.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their aims and object is superficially good, that "We altogether preach." But they do not know the ways. That is their defect. Neither they'll take up as it is. So it will be failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is already failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It is failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The only success they had here is that they got your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> and the <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. In that sense it was a great success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not want anything. They want to assemble together and have some excursion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No more than croaking frogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning, in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> class, we read a verse how Bali Mahārāja had been awarded all material opulences by the Lord-because of his devotion, not because of his <span class="Italic">puṇya.</span> So I gave lecture to the devotees-in the same way Your Divine Grace, because of your devotion and preaching, Kṛṣṇa has given you every facility for propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and although there are other nice movements in India, actually they should all join you. They should all surrender to you. We want that everyone should actually join us at your lotus feet because you have actually been given all <span class="Italic">śakti</span> by Lord Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana.</span> So I told the devotees like this. "Do not be misled by others, even though they may be appearing to do nice work." Actually you are the only one who is really distributing the message of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is very obvious by the result. These others have not made even one foreign disciple. And if they did make one, he could not give up smoking, drinking and this and that. So there is no benefit whatsoever. Any intelligent person can see. Plus you have given us so much nectar. Prahlāda Mahārāja says <span class="Italic">mahāmṛta</span>. I always think of that verse. You have given us so much nectar to absorb our minds in. There is really no chance that we will be influenced by these dry personalities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you take up seriously and distribute. (aside:) It has finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Twenty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, we are very much relieved that you decided to stay. We are feeling very much happy that you are still remaining here. That trip would have been very difficult for you. (long pause; devotees chanting <span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who's the, is in...? Who's the, is in pot?(?) (long pause) It is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> One hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One hundred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Yes. I think before because you were talking. You were engaging in conversation... Śrīla Prabhupāda, I'll just rub some <span class="Italic">śuṣka muladi</span> oil on your feet. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Actually I think you're the only one on the whole planet who is not Māyāvādī-Māyāvādī or influenced by Māyāvādī philosophy. Actually until you came to the West, the only philosophy that had come to America from India was Māyāvādī philosophy. No one knew anything else. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Each verse is like a separate lecture, Śrīla Prabhupāda. What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall chant our beads or read book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which would you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For me, everything is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we can chant <span class="Italic">japa</span> for a little while.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And then we can read again. All right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (devotees chant <span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I received some results of book distribution from September, worldwide, very extraordinary figures. Actually they are astounding figures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) That is right. He misses news.(?) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This resting is very good. <span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span> said that two things, resting and passing urine, are signs of recovery for you. Sleeplessness is bad. But constant resting means that the body is getting a chance to renew itself and take strength. He said that we should look for that resting as a sign of gradual recovery, called "rest and recuperation." (background talking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll just get it, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right feeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right? Says, "Book distribution, worldwide." Says here... These are the world totals for the month of September, Śrīla Prabhupāda. In the month of September all over the world they distributed the following number of big books: 215,914. 216,000 big books in one month, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Medium books: 226,000 in one month. Small books: 237,000. And <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads:</span> 433,000. Now I calculated, Śrīla Prabhupāda, also the total amount of money realized by the BBT. In the month of September the BBT sold, the temples sold 675,000 dollars' worth of books. In rupees, I figured out it's fifty-nine <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> the BBT sold. Now, the temples, when they..., if they sell a book, they get double the amount of money. You know what I mean? If the BBT sells the book to the temple for say $2.50, the temple gets $5.00 when it sells the book. So I calculated that the temples collected $1,350,000 from selling your books in the month of September, which comes out to one <span class="Italic">crore,</span> seventeen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> collections from book sales. Then I was calculating what this would mean... (end)</div>
