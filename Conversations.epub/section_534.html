<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...seeking the necessities of the body, but <span class="Italic">kāṣṭān,</span> with great labor. This is civilization. <span class="Italic">Kāṣṭān karma.</span> The ultimate end is sense gratification, which the dogs and hogs also enjoy without any hard labor, and they think that after working very, very hard, twenty-four hours, and driving the motorcars in three hundred miles speed, this is civilization. The end is the same-sex, that's all, which the cats and dogs enjoy in the street. And they have made this civilization, you see. Working very hard, and enjoy the sex. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What else they are getting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, they say that civilization is more than that. It's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, culture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that culture? Your culture is the same-sex. As soon as there was no light, immediately there was pregnancy. That is the statistic record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, in the blackout.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> New York blackout.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "No business. Come on. Let us enjoy sex." That's all. This is their civilization. <span class="Italic">Yan-maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Most abominable sex life-this is civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> They say that in the human form of life we can ejoy sex life better than the cats and the dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is imagination. They enjoy without any restriction, and you have to make so many arrangement. You require apartment, nice bed, nice this, so many. So where is the better facility? You have to work for it. They haven't got to work. They get in the streets sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But now, they're also saying that this is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> To have sex in the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Without any rules. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are coming to that point, the hippies. Openly they are having sex life, on the street, on the beach. [Break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We may enjoy while we are here now. If we think about the future, then that means we are taking our mind off the present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then close all these universities, school, colleges. Close.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, that's also for enjoyment at present time because we can get together and have social life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is for future, not for present. The child does not want to go to school, but the father forces him to go for future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That's tangible, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That's tangible. You can see. If somebody gets a university education, he gets a job, this, that, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness you can't see how he's going back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And besides that, why you are keeping money in the bank, do good bank balance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Because it's giving interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means for future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, I can enjoy the interest in the present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you don't enjoy... That the future you may not be in difficulty; therefore... Why insurance? Why the insurance company?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Also, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness you can see the result immediately. You become more happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they say there is no future. Then why you are paying insurance fees? There are so many insurance company. Everyone is thinking of future, consciously or unconsciously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> After I die, my children will carry on for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> After I die my children...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also future. "Your children" means future. You enjoy. Why do you care for your children? You enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, it's granted that we are all thinking about the future, but isn't it possible for us to take the best of what the material world has to offer and also make the best of what the spiritual world has to offer, simultaneously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> What is the necessity of renouncing everything? You can't be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not renouncing, not renouncing. Just like our (?) think of future, that is also for present benefit. Future, future... The best intelligence is that just like one is afraid of suffering in old age, future. So there is. That is not ignorance. That is future life. So <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are thinking future life should be very comfortable. They want to go to the heavenly planets. They therefore act very piously, perform <span class="Italic">yajñas.</span> That is all future. So real problem is that we are going to get another body in future. So what kind of body we shall get? That is intelligence. Body you have to get. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So one should be very intelligent-"What kind of body I am going to get?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why can't we have sense gratification and God also at the same time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that <span class="Italic">aviruddho-kāmo 'smi.</span> "Sense gratification which is not against religious principles, that sense gratification I am," Kṛṣṇa says. We do not stop sense gratification, but we want to regulate sense gratification like a gentleman, not like hogs and dogs. That is human civilization. Sense gratification like hogs and dogs, not required. Sense gratification... People are following that. Although they are so degraded, still, they have not sanctioned as yet to have openly sense gratification on the street like hogs and dogs. That is regulated. That's still going on. But because the civilization is gliding down to animalism, they don't want this restriction. That is the hippies' protest, that, "Why this convention required? Let us enjoy like hogs and dogs." That is advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> The scientists are helping them do that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> The scientists are helping them to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What shall we... Why should we enjoy sense gratification like gentlemen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Why should a person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you do it? That is the, already there. Why don't you have sense gratification on the street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Well, they're already having. People are already having.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not having very freely, not very freely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's against the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, against the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, if I'm always worried about the future, how will anything get done now? If I'm always worried about the future, how will anything get done now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we gave that you are not to think of future foolishly. Anyone who is going to school, it does not mean that he is not taking care of his body. The school-going is future, but still he's taking care of his body. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...of survival of the fittest. If I have a lot of sense enjoyment, then that is God's will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But nobody is fit to survive. (laughs) That is the real problem. You are struggling for surviving, but you'll not survive. That is nature's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, they say that within this life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because... There is. But these rascals, they do not know how to survive. If you have got death, then where is your question of surviving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So why not eat, drink, and be merry because tomorrow you die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all right. That, animals are also doing. You can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> But the animals are happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why do you say survival? The animals do not think of survival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> I didn't mention survival. He did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are free. They are never worried about survival or death. Never.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So the animals are happy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> But human beings are unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore they are becoming generally, gliding down to animal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So isn't that better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for you. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> If the animals are happy and the human beings are unhappy, why not live like an animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So yes, they are coming to that, animal life. Then why do you call human civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if I stop all these activities, then there will be no more pleasure. If I stop all these activities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, pleasure, you do not know what is pleasure. You rascal, you do not know what is pleasure. Just like the hog. He's also enjoying pleasure, eating stool. So your pleasure is like that. You eat stool and enjoy life. That is your standard of pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But who...? We can say that because we're above the hogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But what do the hogs think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hogs think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They think they're enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you become hog, you will also think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But let us say just from our human standpoint...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the human standpoint is... If a hog eating stool, you hate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We hate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But he doesn't hate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore... Because he is hog. You become hog. You'll not hate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But what if I am human being? I am enjoying this material life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you hate that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, I don't hate what I'm doing now, myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you are given a plate of stool, would you like to eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why? Why do you hate? Why do you hate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But I'm not a hog now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They eat the hog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But I am not a hog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore you hate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I hate it because I'm not a hog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> If I was a hog, I would like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So become hog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, I don't want to become hog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you'll have to hate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, I want to stay as a human being and enjoy here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is... (?) Then you'll hate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But someone else has to hate it, not the person who is actually enjoying it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is enjoying stool? Human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They may say that "The hog... It's all right if I become a hog. So it doesn't matter if I become a hog or a dog because I may hate the hog's enjoyment while I'm a human being. When I'm a hog, I'll also like it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> So it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The nature will give you the chance. If you want to enjoy stool next life, it will be available.(?) You enjoy. That is nature's law-"If you like this, come on. Take it." <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhutānāṁ </span><i class="calibre3">hṛd-deśe<span class="Italic"></span></i> 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61]. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart, and if He sees that "This rascal desires like this," immediately He orders to the material nature, "Give him a body like hog. He wants to enjoy." <span class="Italic">Brahmāyan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> This is already stated. If you want a hog's body, immediately it is ready. You can get a dog's body, hog's body. Similarly, if you want devotee's body, that will be offered also to you. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> As you desire, Kṛṣṇa is ready to give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But if the standard is happiness, and the hog is happy and the devotee is happy, then what is the distinction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That distinction the hogs and dogs cannot make. That is for human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What happens if a human being can't distinguish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that he cannot make any distinction. Both the same. That is <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā-mohitaḥ.</span> Just like on the street, there it is signboard: "Keep to the left." The hogs and dogs cannot do it. But human beings can do. That is the distinction between hogs and dogs and human being. Human being is supposed to make distinction. And the hogs and dogs are supposed not to make any distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sign: "No dogs allowed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The sign "No dogs allowed" is not meant for dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Someone would say that that example just means that the hog doesn't speak your language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The hog doesn't speak your language, it doesn't mean that he doesn't discriminate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore language, civilized language, is not meant for the dogs and hogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, it's just different language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No different, not different language. I mean to say that rules and regulations, books, they are not meant for hogs and dogs. Even their own language, it is said, they'll not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So you say that two kinds of people enjoy life, the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas</span> and the great fools. So what's wrong with being a great fool? They're also enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You become. That's nice. If you want to remain a great fool, there is no checking you. You can go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Well, then what, what is the check on fools? What is the check on fools?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no check on fools. You can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do we know that the animals don't know all of these great truths?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do we know that the animals don't know all of these truths?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they cannot follow. If you call the dogs and hogs, "Please come here. There will be <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> lecture," they'll not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> We have already had a hog's body. So we didn't like it. Otherwise, why would we change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. By the process of nature automatically evolves. That is evolution. They do not know. But nature giving him chance, this type of body, this, more intelligent, more intelligent, more intelligent... Then you come to the human form of body, very good intelligence. And if he does not utilize it, again he becomes a hogs and dog. Go round, merry-go-round. Merry-go-round. If you don't take... You have got now. By evolution you have got this human form of body. If you do not utilize it properly, then again you become hog. So again, for millions' years. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They say, "We don't remember. We don't remember being a hog, so what is the harm?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We don't remember being a hog, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is hoggism, that you do not remember. Therefore you are hog. Because you do not remember, therefore you are hog. That is the distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why did God create death in order to stop our enjoyment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why did God create death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore you are under the control of God. You understand it. So you cannot become free. Therefore death is there, ultimately. You are thinking you are free of the kingdom of God, or laws of God. "No, you are not free. You'll die and you'll accept another body and according to My decision." That is God. This is a question like "Why government created punishment? Why not enjoy ourself without any punishment?" It is a question like that. And that cannot be. It is not possible. That is the proof that there is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Death is the proof that there is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And the other part is that then there is another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Death and then another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another body, immediately. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> That is the tangible proof that there is God. You have to die and accept another body. Just like the proof of government is that you are acting irresponsibly, you must be arrested or be punished. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they say it is just a proof of nature, not a proof of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, nature is instrumental, just like jail is instrument. But the proprietor of the jail, conductor of the jail, is government. Jail is not acting independently. By the government's direction. Similarly, the nature is working by the direction of God. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> That is stated. Nature is not independent. Just like the nature is that this lump of matter will lie down here, but if God desires, it can fly on the sky. That is God's will. Nature is not independent. Then it would have remained here. Just like Lord Rāmacandra collected stones, and it was floating. According to law of gravitation, how it can float?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, they say that's just a story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The planets are floating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. How these planets are floating? That is also story? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How long would the planets float if it was put in the hands of a scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If they were in charge of enforcing the law of floating the planets...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them do that. See. That was done by Hiraṇyākṣa. He brought down the planet, in the ocean, but Kṛṣṇa again rescued.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, and killed him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And killed him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So in the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> verse it says that this body is a field of enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Thirteenth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does it say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The field of activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he said, "field of enjoyment." He said. What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was changing the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preacher (?) Where it is taken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Well, Kṛṣṇa says that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where says? Why do you speak like nonsense, "This body is for enjoyment"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> No, field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says that the living entity is the enjoyer of the field and the body is the field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So the living entity can enjoy his desires in that field according to his past activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not enjoyment. It is worker, just like this field is for working, and the farmer is working. That does not mean he's enjoying. He's working. This field is given for working. But this working does not mean that he's enjoying. And because this working, working on the field is not enjoyment, therefore nobody's coming. They are going to the factory. They are going to the factory. Had it been enjoyment, then they would have come. But no, they go to the factory. And they are prepared to purchase from the farmer at any cost to avoid this working. That is the difficulty at the present moment. If you are asked that "You work here," I don't think you'll agree. It is not enjoyment. Will you take a plow and do...? No. Why? If it is enjoyment, why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> The work is too hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that's it. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So what I meant... This body is a field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, body is field is... The example is given. Just like this field, to work with this body is not enjoyment. Everyone is suffering with body, so many people, always suffering threefold miseries. That is not enjoyment. It is enjoyment for the fools, rascals, who are covered by the illusory energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> you use the term field. You use "the enjoyer of the field."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his breathing period. (?) One who is suffering, where is enjoyment? Every field, every body, is given to the living entity because he wanted. Just like some of you want to become hog, so that field of activities, hog's body, will be given to you. Enjoy it. You want it, and Kṛṣṇa is there within your heart. He understands that you want it-"Take it." That's all. "Now enjoy. Become hog."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One question, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> If the planets, they have always been floating, but the stones of Lord Rāmacandra has put in the ocean, they are still not... Where are they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The stones that Rāmacandra put, they are not still floating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Floating, that is Rāmacandra's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What happenned to the stones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Rāmacandra knows. You go there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> "...enjoyment comes from the fact that he thinks he's saving the world. He's out preaching. Your enjoyment is simply subtle sense gratification."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> They say that our enjoyment is subtle sense gratification. We feel we're saving the world. Therefore we get some pleasure from that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you say sense gratification, senses are there, and senses want satisfaction, but you can know the proper way of satisfaction. That we are teaching. We do not say that "Make your senses blunt." But you enjoy properly. That is stated, <span class="Italic">tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyet sattva hy asmad brahma-saukhyam anantam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are wanting sense gratification, but it is being checked up on account of your diseased condition of life. Therefore you purify yourself. Then you enjoy senses perpetually. This is the injunction. We are not stopping sense gratification. But you are trying to gratify senses in your diseased condition. Just like if you are feverish, you cannot enjoy to eat a <span class="Italic">rasagullā.</span> It will be not tasteful. So cure yourself and enjoy <span class="Italic">rasagullā.</span> That is our program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are sometimes accused of being very puffed up because we are, they, we, we think that we can have a direct relationship with God, that God will speak to us. So we are accused of being very puffed up for thinking that we can have a direct relationship with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is natural for the fools because they cannot think of it, that one can talk with God. But God says, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti: [Bg. </span>4.9] "After giving up this body, the devotees come to Me." Then where, what you will do there? He'll talk or not talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara::</span> There he'll talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then? There is process, how to talk with God. But these rascals, they do not know. They think it is all imagination. They do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But we are so insignificant. Why should God waste His time talking with us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because you are sons. Although you are insignificant, you are God's sons. So He likes to talk with His sons. Just like a small child. Everyone knows that he cannot talk. Still, father tries to make him talking, to enjoy. Māyāpura-candrodaya Temple is teaching all these fools and rascals how to talk with God. That is our mission. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...citizens in the state are punished by the government by being put into the prison house and that similarly, in this human form of life, if we are irresponsible, then we are punished by God by birth and death. So what about the man who is responsible for his family and executes his duty ni...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is... Cats and dogs have also responsible for the family. What is credit for him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, what actually is responsibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The dog also allows the nipple to be sucked by the cubs. That is family maintenance. So what credit do you get by family maintenance? Why do you specially claim any benefit by maintain...? That is being done by the cats and dogs. Do you think that the animals do not take care of their children? Then if you take, then what is the difference between him and yourself? You are also the cats and dogs. Your main business is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If you forget that-you remain cats and dogs-then you'll become again cats and dogs. <span class="Italic">Punar muṣiko bhava:</span> "Again become a mouse." The mouse was given the chance to elevate gradually to a tiger, and when he became tiger, he wanted to devour the saintly person. And he said, "All right, again you become mouse." That is also... You are given the chance of self-realization. If you do not do it, then again become cats and dogs, maintain your family.</div>
