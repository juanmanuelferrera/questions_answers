<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I was trying to single out a few, but it was impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Welcome. No, no. All welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> An international society for cameras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cameras?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Everyone has camera. This way we go? [break] Everyone should chant softly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But here we cannot walk in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We cannot all walk, I don't think. It is too thin here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many men. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] It is closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They don't like traffic in here so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That's nice. Good idea. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are getting cheated from all sides. The scientists are cheating them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they want to be cheated. What can be done? <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like the advertisement, "No faith, no philosophy, no restriction." You want all these things; therefore he has come to cheat you: "Yes. No regulation. You can do whatever you like." And then he will praised, "Oh, he is good, good swamiji. He has no restriction. And here is a most conservative swamiji. 'Don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this.' " They want to be cheated. As soon as you speak the truth they will not accept. They will argue. What is the wrong in illicit sex? Why he's restricting? This is the... They go to guru to teach the guru, not to take lesson from the guru. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> ...thinks that they have some responsibility in the world, and if you say all of a sudden that "You have no responsibility..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that "Yes, you have responsibility so long you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious," not that a person who is not in the devotional service of the Lord, he can say, "I have no responsibility." He cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot. He has all the duties. But one who has taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness without any reservation, he has no duty. He has no respons...</div>
<div class="Verse">devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇaṁ pitṛṇaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>nayam ṛṇī na kiṅkaro rājan<br class="calibre2"/>sarvātmanā ye śaraṇaṁ śaraṇyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>gato mukundaṁ parihṛtya kārtam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 11.5.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the statement. As soon as we take birth, we have got so many responsibilities. We are responsible to perform sacrifices for all the demigods. You are taking light from the sun. You have got responsibility. Otherwise how you are getting so much light? If you don't pay the electric bill, the next day it will be disconnected. And you are taking so much light from the sun. You have no responsibility? You have. "No, there is no responsibility. You are taking light, air, water. So many things you are taking, supplied by the different demigods. <span class="Italic">Deva, ṛṣi, ṛṣi,</span> great... Just like Vyāsadeva or many other <span class="Italic">ṛṣis,</span> they have given you knowledge, and you have no responsibility? You have responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Then the responsibility for some is to Kṛṣṇa; the responsibility of some is to the demigods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Demigods, you have got responsibility. <span class="Italic">Deva, ṛṣi, bhūta,</span> living entities. Just like you are taking milk from the cows. You have the responsibility to protect it, but you are killing. So you must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So the present system is simply expert at producing completely irresponsible people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they are talking of responsibility. But one who is devotee... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They say we are irresponsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not irresponsible. We have finished all responsibility. We are not irresponsible. But we are in such a position that we have passed all these responsibilities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> So, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you told this lady, this woman last night, that she should give up her responsibilities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the only respons... Then you can... Not that you give up all responsibility. First of all take to Kṛṣṇa responsibility. Then there is no responsibility. Give up something; take something. Then it is all right. And give up everything and then you zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But they see responsibility only in terms of making a bank balance and having a nice home and satisfying our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are suffering. In spite of bank balance, they are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (whispering) ...finding it impossible on that side. Excuse me. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...said, suppose you have not done your responsibility properly, so then you have become sinful. Hm? Is it not? So Kṛṣṇa gives assurance that "You surrender to Me, and I give you protection from all sins." So even you think that "By giving up my all other responsibilities I am taking shelter of You. Then I will be punishable for my sinful act," so Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then where is my responsibility? I become free immediately, provided I surrender to Kṛṣṇa without any reservations. Then. Then it is. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They will say that suffering is a part of life, that suffering is a necessary part of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are trying to get out of suffering? Suffer, rascal. Why you are trying to get out of suffering. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Because they don't like it. But they say you have to accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, if you say... If it is a part of life, why don't you like it? Suffer. Go on suffering. You are accepting as part of life because you cannot get out of it. "The grapes are sour." That's all. After jumping, jumping, jumping, when it is not available, "Oh, the grapes are sour. It is no... There is no necessity." Jackal's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They will surrender to the misery, but they will not surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? When you speak of taking care of your responsibilities for Kṛṣṇa, doesn't that also have a material aspect to it? Just like a parent must bring up the child, must take care of the child, train it to read, and to write, and so on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means we are taking care of the children-why? Just to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious, not to become cats and dogs. This is our responsibility. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious, that "Here is a child. He may be saved to make him Kṛṣṇa conscious." Therefore we are taking so much care in the Dallas. We are not irresponsible. But our responsibility is there, that "Make him Kṛṣṇa conscious."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So when we say that we have finished all responsibility by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, that doesn't mean that we've abandoned execution of duty, does it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Who says that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, some people say that "You've taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and now you have given up all of your..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not duty? This is the main duty. This is the main duty. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have taken responsibility for Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are doing. Why we are traveling all over the world thrice in a year? We have taken the responsibility. Otherwise, who is, an old man, he'll take such responsibility? That is a greater responsibility. When you become a big officer of the government, it means you overburdened with responsibility, not this flickering resp... Here the material respons... means it has no use. You are simply wasting time. And here is real responsibility and real life. That I explained to that lady, that "Even if you take respons... what can you do? You cannot do anything." The example I gave, that "You have taken responsibility for your son's disease. He is suffering. You have brought good physician, you have brought good medicine, everything, but what can you do? In spite of your all responsibility, your son dies. Then where is the value of your responsibility?" Do you think simply by bringing a nice physician and nice medicine you can save your son? Then where is your responsibility? Actually you cannot do anything, so what is the use of saying that "I am responsible"? You cannot do anything. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one blind man says, "I'll take responsibility. You all blind men follow me," so what is the use of this responsibility? He will die and others will die. So what is the meaning of this responsibility? Even if you take as very responsible man, you cannot do anything. That is not possible. You cannot save. Who wants that "My son dies, my father dies, and I'll take them and..."? But one little disease will finish your responsibi... Every nation is taken, all the leaders, and as soon as there is war, thousands and thousands will be killed. What responsibility? As soon as one atom bomb is dropped, then is many thousand will be finished. Then what is your responsibility? You cannot give. You can make a statue: "These soldiers died. These soldiers died." That's all. But you could not save them from death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Then they would say that we also must die. Everyone must die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we die-to live forever. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> We die for that. This is the last death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Then they will say, "How do we know?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... You are rascal. How you will know? You come to my feet; then you will know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> To your feet or to your boot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, provided there is boot. Yes. Therefore there is a Vedic injunction, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "Because you are fool, rascal, you must approach a guru." That is the way. <span class="Italic">Sa gurum eva, eva,</span> "certainly," <span class="Italic">abhigacchet,</span> "must go." Otherwise there is no possibility. You remain as foolish forever and suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There is one German historian named Frederick Engels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is another foolish. (laughter) I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He wrote against Vedic culture by saying that even the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> of Vedic culture were not responsible because the culture failed. It ended at a certain period in history. It was simply exploitation of the workers under the guise of religion. That was his argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That was not the fault of the</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The argument of foolish man-who is caring? Vedic culture when finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five thousand years ago. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu, five hundred years, how He accepted if it is finished? He is more than Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are willing to take so many material risks, but they are not willing to try spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their fault. That is their foolishness. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> How would we define the word responsibility in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Responsibility is that you have got this human form of life. Realize God. This is your responsibility. Otherwise you are finished. Three words: "You have got this human form of life. Your only responsibility is to understand God. This is your responsibility." That is Vedic culture. For understanding God, many, many kings, many, many saints, they left everything and went to the forest to realize God. That is Vedic culture. Bhārata Mahārāja, under whose name India is called <span class="Italic">Bhāratavarṣa,</span> he was the emperor of this planet, and at the age of twenty-four years he left everything to realize God. This is Vedic culture. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His position was very, very nice, as a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha-</span>a nice beautiful wife, affectionate mother, good influence, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, learned scholar, everything first class. He left everything just to show us. He was God Himself, but to set the example, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rajya-lakṣmīm</span> [SB 11.5.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> He gave up a kingdom of fortune which is aspired by the demigods. Such a nice life, such a nice family, but He gave up. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīm dharmistha arya...</span> [SB 11.5.34]. Just to teach us the process of realizing God. This is Vedic system. [break] Somebody may not push. [break] ...water? No. Very deep?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Not so much here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you ask me... What is that, definition of respons...? So you understand what is the responsibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We have this human life. We must realize God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, three words. Make the rascals understand it. We speak the whole responsibility in three words. Is it complete or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or you have got any protest? This is the only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Let Śrīla Prabhupāda go through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They have not taken God realization as a responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Simply as a pastime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their ignorance. They do not know what is respons...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> They would say that so many may have taken God realization as responsibility, following some Christ... church or something like that, but they are also frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not frustrated. Eh? We are not frustrated. Are we frustrated? Then? How the rascal says, "frustrated"? If you take false thing, then you will be frustrated. If you take real path of God realization, there is no question of frustration. It is <span class="Italic">ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam,</span> increasing pleasure, no frustration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Then they say that no one has real information of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have no, rascal, because you are rascal. I have got. You just wash my feet, and I will inform you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Haribol.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not know how to swim; that does not mean I do not. Is it a very honest statement? Oh, nobody can swim because he does not know. But if anyone knows how to swim, then why do you say that no one has done? You do not know. You accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Everyone thinks in terms of their own relative position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Even an insignificant bird, because he knows swimming, he knows swimming, so he can challenge, and because you do not know swimming, you cannot say like that. Even insignificant bird, just see how nicely he is swimming. He knows the art. [break] ...one, cent percent of the modern people, they do not believe in God, and they do not know what is religion. That is the position. They think, "Religion is sentiment. Anyone can manufacture his own sentiment. There is no God." This is the position. So we are in fault. "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." The whole world is under this conception. Therefore we are at fault. We are preaching God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Generally they make it difficult for us to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They hinder us in so many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Because they have not realized that we have taken a responsibility. When a man has a responsibility usually he is given some certain facilities to carry out that responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone, cent percent godless, neither they have got intelligence to understand what is God. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Then we are giving them the intelligence as well as the answers? Because if they have no intelligence to understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our organization is that. Why we are opening so many centers? Just to give these rascals intelligence. Why Kṛṣṇa is recognizing so nicely a preacher? Because He knows that he has to face so many difficulties. He is not easygoing, armchair politician, no. He has to face so many difficulties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa recognizes by giving knowledge of Himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa immediately gives him all facilities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> There has never been a movement like this which has given factual knowledge of God. Therefore they think it's sentiment, religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to abide by their sentiment? Because they are rascals, we have to become rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (aside:) The top has come down? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the... Time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> 6:17.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if you take so-called responsibility, you will not be allowed to carry it out. The example I was giving: Napoleon, Hitler, and Gandhi. They took responsibility, but they were driven away. What can I do? So what is the meaning of your responsibility? You will not be allowed to execute your responsibility. What remedy you have done that you will not be allowed, kicked out? Then where is your responsibility? Even if you are very nice gentleman-you have taken responsibility-but nature will not allow you to execute the responsibility. What is your answer to that? Big, big Napoleon, big, big Hitler, big, big Gandhi came and gone. Where is the responsibility executed? The Napoleon was given horse urine. You know? By the Britishers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> To drink.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. At the last stage when he was asking for water he was given horse urine. He died like that. Hitler committed suicide. Gandhi was killed. So where is their responsibility? They falsely thinking, "Without me, everything will be lost." But they are kicked out; everything is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> It's the same with President De Gaulle. President De Gaulle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, Nixon is there, but when he was on the office, he was thinking, "Without me America will go to hell." But he has gone to hell; America is there. (laughter) Just see. Just see the position of the... You can see the Nixon. When he was in the office, oh, he was a big man. He was responsible man. Now he is kicked out. He is begging, and America is going on. Where is the need of this responsibility? For several months he was asked that "You give up your responsibility." The rascal will not give: "No, without me America will go to hell." Just see. This is responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> All of these big politicians, they seem to fall very ill afterwards. They seem to become very sick. Nixon is also sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only sick, they die very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Radhakrishnan was paralyzed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Brain paralyzed. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Give this to Yogeśvara. (Prabhupāda and devotees get into car and drive away)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Actually they are envious. We are doing the same things they are doing, but better, and getting the results. We are working. We are doing so many things like they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not lazy. [break] ...Nixon was elected. I saw propaganda, "America needs Nixon." You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People also thought, "Yes." He never said, "Nixon needs money." (laughter) This is cheating. He needs some money; he said, "America needs Nixon." And the rascals were befooled. [break] All these politicians do like that. What is their responsibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Now Nixon is in debt. He is now in debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Debt? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> For his legal fees. He owes 300,000 dollars. So one rabbi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he cannot give 300,000 dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, he has no money. He had to pay taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are paying 300,000. So we are better than him. [break] ...rabbi is a Jew?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. So this rabbi, he is a personal friend. He has taken the responsibility for raising the money. Actually the fees were 500,000. He has already raised 200,000. 300,000 to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And nobody is excusing the fee, the lawyers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No. But now he is writing his book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, another fallacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> For that book he will get two and a half million dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About his life history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. He is very sick now. Now he sleeps twelve hours a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That is good. [break] He is released from all political obligations or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> From the charges?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No. Actually he can be called to give testimony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Testimony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. There are certain pending investigations. So he is eligible for being called to give testimony for these investigations. But on the plea of his bad health, therefore he is not being called. He is afraid actually. Right now he does not go to any social gatherings, he does not make any public appearances. He is afraid that as soon as he makes public appearances, then he will be called to give testimony. So he is actually being forced to live a very lonely life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lonely life means drinking. What he will do? [break] ...this was made by Napoleon?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So the arch is still here. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People, they come to see the arch. Just like in Rome, so many broken buildings, thousands of men go to see them, and they get good income, tourist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> On New Year's we took our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party through that arch.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> For New Year's. And they all applauded us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is another arch this side? No. Where is the other boy? I do not see him. What was the name? Yesterday he was there. One of your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Viśvambhara?</div>
