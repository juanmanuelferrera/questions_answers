<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> It is the most satisfying thing I have been reading up to now. I have been searching through the Tibetan Books of the Dead, but it wasn't enough, and this is beyond that. It is really complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In your country people will like it? They would like these ideas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Oh, yes. Absolutely, absolutely. I have such a keen interest in going to see what the situation is because I... [break] ...for Venice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Venice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes. So it would be so fantastic to present them a platform of religion so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not religion. Of course it is religion. But the religion, as it is misunderstood in European countries that religion is a kind of faith, but it is not like that. It is science. It is fact. Religion, you have got some faith. That may not be right. It may be wrong. Just like the Christian religion, they have got faith in this way, that animal has no soul. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not a fact. Do you agree or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> I do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal also has soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do they disagree, that animal has no soul? What is the point? Why do they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Because they don't like to identify themselves with animals. Because if they admit that animals have a soul, then they have to identity, means they are afraid of identifying with animals. They feel they are superior to animals. We are superior to animals, indeed, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is by intelligence. We are superior to animals by superior intelligence, not by... Just like a human child. His father is superior than the child because the father has got superior intelligence, not that the child has no soul. The child talks so many nonsense things, but we take it, "After all, it is child." Nobody cares whether it is symmetrical or not, because his intelligence is not developed. So even the animals have no developed intelligence, that does not mean it has no soul. Yes. The evolution of different types of body means evolution of intelligence. Just like a flower, in the bud stage, the flower is there. But the fragrance or the beauty has not yet developed. So unless the things are there, how it can develop? Similarly, the soul is there in every living entity, but according to the development of the body, evolution of the body, the intelligence becomes manifest. Otherwise, what is the meaning of education? Education means to develop the intelligence. That is education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Are you thinking of formal education now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any education. You train a child to the standard of that education and he will develop his intelligence. A child who does not know what is what, the father says "This is... My dear child, it is watch." Once, twice, thrice, you call, "Watch, watch, watch," he learns, "This is watch." <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi, aside) So one has to awaken the intelligence. So that supreme intelligence is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one comes to the point of supreme intelligence, that is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like a rose flower, when it comes to the full blooming stage, it is very beautiful, fragrant, like that. So when a living entity comes to the understanding of his constitutional position, what he is actually, and acts like that, that is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then it is full development. That is called <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam. Buddhi</span> is there, intelligence is there, and when it is fully developed for understanding Kṛṣṇa, that is called <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam.</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is described, <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti. Buddhi-yogam</span> means the intelligence, but... Don't come near. The intelligence which gets the living entity back to home, back to Godhead. That is called <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam.</span> Any yoga system means connecting link with the Supreme. When we speak of <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam,</span> that is the ultimate yoga. That is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gata antar-ātmanā [Bg. </span>6.47]<span class="Italic">.</span> All different types of yoga practice, the most important and topmost yoga practice is to think of Kṛṣṇa always within oneself. That is being practiced, Hare Kṛṣṇa. The topmost yoga system. [break] You are experienced. Try to understand this philosophy and give it to your country. Your country is a most important country in Europe. Roman civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Greek civilization, Roman civilization, is the beginning of European civilization. So your position is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Well, yes. When I was a child I was brought up to go to the mass every morning, and I used to answer in Latin, you know, and serve the priest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes. Even twice a day until the age of fourteen, and then we went to catechism. And then I left, I left alone, you know, by my own will. [break] It would be fantastic to go back with a background of, with the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa and talk to them about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. [break] ...this boy, he is going to develop our Italian center, Rome. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> ...the personal and impersonal features of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Kṛṣṇa, being at the same time infinite expansion of energy and also being form, a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, person. Originally He is person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> In the heart, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Localized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the sun or the moon. There is the sun-god or the moon-god within the planet. That is the original. And then the sun globe, it is localized. And then the sunshine and the moonshine. Hare Kṛṣṇa (Hindi) (aside:) [break] ...what is impersonal and personal. What is that? Repeat it, what I have said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> This way, if I understand what is personal and impersonal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, what is that personal and impersonal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Is that Kṛṣṇa also has a... He's a person. He is not only all-pervading abstract energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is all-pervading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes, but He also is a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not also. He is person. This all pervasive influence or all pervasive feature is His expansion of energy. The same example: The sunshine is the expansion of energy of the sun globe, and the sun globe is the place for the sun-god. The sun-god is a person, and sun globe is the place where this sun-god lives, and sunshine is the expansion of the energy of the sun disc. Try to understand it very... Because this question is very complicated. People cannot understand. You try to understand this. God, Kṛṣṇa, is originally a person. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti bhagavān iti. Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> Just like if you want to see the sun-god, there is a person. His name is also mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Vivasvān. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is a person. Now you cannot see the person so easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Exactly. I wanted to ask you about Kṛṣṇa in the heart. Could you tell us something about His physiognomy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. His physiognomy is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda vigraha</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That we can understand. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda.</span> He is eternal, He is full of knowledge and He is blissful. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda.</span> Your body, my body, is just opposite. It is not eternal, it is temporary. And it is full of ignorance. Therefore we require knowledge. (aside:) Little away, yes. So this is full of ignorance, and there are so many miseries. So Kṛṣṇa hasn't got a body like this. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's body is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.</span> So we can distinguish what is Kṛṣṇa's body and what is our body. [break] ...understand. Try to understand, that what is the nature... That is called spiritual body. So we have got also similar body, but very small, very small. That is covered by this material body. And because in the spiritual body I am person, I have got form, therefore the material elements have taken a form. Just like when your coat is made, it is made according to your body. Because you have got hands, so the coat has got a hand. But the hand of the coat is not real. The real hand is within the coat. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Within. These foolish people, they do not understand. They take, "This is hand. This is hand." He does not know that this hand is artificial, outward. Real hand is within. This is their misconception. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Try to understand. These are very important question. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Because within the coat the real man is there, therefore the dress has assumed two hands, two legs, one collar, like that. But this is false, like dress. Real... Therefore every living entity has got form. He is not formless. This less intelligent class of men, because they cannot see the form... It is so small... It is so small that if you divide the top portion of your hair into ten thousand parts,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Your one hair into ten thousand parts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The top portion, tip of the hair, the point, you divide into ten thousand parts, and that one part is the form of the soul. It is such minute, small... Because they cannot see, they say it is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> No, it is not <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> It is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Can I ask you one question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> When we see Kṛṣṇa in us, in our hearts, the moment Kṛṣṇa comes, the moment that the link takes place with Kṛṣṇa in our hearts...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa is always within your heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes. But at the moment that our soul opens itself and succeeds in putting a link... [break] I mean, I'm sorry, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has this feature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> It is a matter of words. It is difficult to explain this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You cannot create God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> No, of course not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These Māyāvādī philosophers, they create God. Anthropomorphism. What is that anthropomorphism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> To imagine that God has a form. Man imagines God, not that God exists originally, but man imagines God based on his own form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anthropomorphism it is called. They create a form, but that is not the fact. God has His eternal form. That I explained. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. Vigraha</span> means form. And it is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda,</span> means eternal, full of knowledge and... Just like Kṛṣṇa is speaking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> People are accepting, because that is real knowledge. And nobody reads other books so carefully. And this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is read all over the world. All big, big scholars, big, big philosophers, theologists, they read. Because that is real knowledge. That is the proof. It is real knowledge. <span class="Italic">Cit. Sac-cid.</span> And one who is giving real knowledge, it is natural conclusion, he has got eternal body. We cannot give real knowledge because we forget. As we change our body, we forget. Just like at night we dream, but we forget the body, this body. In another body we go to some dreamland. So because we change body therefore we forget. And because Kṛṣṇa is giving knowledge perfect, past, present and future, therefore it means that He has got eternal body. This is the proof. One should understand everything with logic. Is it not? We forget because we have no eternal body. Last birth, what I was, what you were, we have forgotten, because changed body. Death means forgetting. So because Kṛṣṇa is giving perfect knowledge of past, future and present, therefore it is to be understood that He has got eternal body. And eternal body means there is no misery. Misery means <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9],</span> to take birth, to die... (aside:) (Hare Kṛṣṇa.) And to suffer from disease, to suffer from old age. These are the miseries. So because Kṛṣṇa hasn't got this temporary body, therefore He is not suffering from these things. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, you will see always, young man. You will never see Kṛṣṇa's picture as old man, because He is eternal body. This is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> In our heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, heart or not heart. Your heart or not heart, but Kṛṣṇa's position is like that. He has got eternal body. He is blissful, because there is no miseries. Temporary body means there is misery, so many miseries. At least these four miseries, birth, death, old age and disease. So eternal body has no such miseries. Therefore it is blissful. Therefore it is full of knowledge. As soon as you get your eternal body, which is already there within this temporary body, then you also become blissful and full of knowledge. That is oneness. One in quality. Kṛṣṇa has got this body, eternal, blissful, full of knowledge. So when you get this body, then you are becoming equal in quality, not in quantity. Your question is answered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got any doubt, you can still ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Maybe... May I emphasize... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got your photo. So... but the difference is that your photograph and you are different. Because the photograph is of the temporary body, therefore it is not absolute. But Kṛṣṇa, being everything, Kṛṣṇa's photograph is also Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes, okay, thank you. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Yes, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is everything. So His photograph is also Kṛṣṇa. It is not that foolish people, they worship a photograph. No. It is reality. It is reality. Yes. [break] Kṛṣṇa is everything. Can you explain? That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Who can explain? Explain, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi... [Bg. </span>7.8]. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo analo vāyuḥ [Bg. </span>7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because this material world means these elements, this earth, this water, then fire, then air, then sky-five elements. So what are these elements? These elements are Kṛṣṇa's energy. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo analo vāyuḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Material energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material energy, yes. And the living entities, they are also energy, spiritual energy. Two energies. Two energies means just like fire. Fire has got two energies, heat and light. Similarly, the whole creation is combination of Kṛṣṇa's energy. Therefore everything is Kṛṣṇa. Is it not? Yes. Just like you take milk. From milk you prepare so many milk preparations. You prepare yogurt, you prepare ghee, you prepare <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> you prepare <span class="Italic">burfi</span> and so many others. But therefore, actually, all of them are milk. This is... Under different combination only. In the milk, if you put some sour thing, it becomes yogurt. But it is milk. And that sour thing also, which is put into the milk, that is also Kṛṣṇa. [break] Why He is originally person, try to understand. And all these energies are imperson. Just like I am a person, you are a person. But when I... My temperature is imperson. Is it not? I have got temperature, if you put thermometer. That is imperson. So person is the origin, and the impersonal temperature is the energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> I see, yes, yes. And the difference between the impersonalist, I mean, and the personalist is that the impersonalist does not believe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, believe... You don't believe or not believe, it doesn't matter. We are explaining science. If somebody says, "No, there is no temperature," that is foolishness. There is temperature. How can you say there is no temperature? There is temperature. Even you go to the water, there is temperature. Everywhere. Because the elements are all there, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo analo vāyu...</span> The beginning is the <span class="Italic">ākāśa,</span> ether. The ether is in the air, the air is in the fire, the fire is in the water, and the earth is in the water. This is this way. And in the earth you will find everything. You will find air, ether, water, fire, everything. And the final state, it is ether only, originally. So suppose I am breathing. It is ethereal. But so many things are coming. If I am contaminated, by touching my breathing, you will be contaminated, and it will come out as disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> Can you repeat please?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like this breathing is ethereal, but if there is potency... There is potency. So by being contaminated by my breathing, you become contaminated, and it comes out again as disease. So the ethereal composition is the origin. Then gradually, it develops. Ether into air, air into fire, fire into water, water into earth. [break] ...consideration of the gross thing. How the gross thing coming into existence from subtle thing, they do not know it. That is less intelligent. They cannot think very, what is called, minutely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> And beyond ether?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the same example. The breathing is coming from a person. So breathing is impersonal, but it is coming from the person. Similarly, originally God is person. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> everything is explained, "From Me. I am the origin of everything." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is... This has to be..., how everything is coming from Him. And if we understand how it is coming, then we have to accept that it is coming from the person, not from the imperson. Imperson is secondary manifestation of the person. Just like the fire. Fire is the origin. It has got a form. But secondary manifestation of the fire is heat and light. Not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian man:</span> The second manifestation of fire is heat and light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is heat and light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Italian Man (1):</span> And fire is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fire is the origin. That is form. That is not formless. Heat may be formless. Light may be formless, but fire is not formless. <span class="Italic">Thik hai?</span> If you have got intelligence, then from the form-less, you can approach the form. Just like the sunshine, shining is formless. If you have got form, go to the sun planet. And if you go to the sun planet, you will see the sun-god. But they cannot go. They cannot appreciate that there is a person who is known as sun-god. But it is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham...</span> The name is also given, what is the name of that person. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> ...recently what we read from the papers. There is so many... So far, nobody tells us that there is a moon-god over there. Although they have gone to particular one place only or two, three places only, not the whole moon, but still, nobody comes from. They say nobody is there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these bodies are imperfect. They are not perfect. The moon may not be exposed to them, these rascals. Because a king is not exposed to the ordinary man... Unless one is fit to see him, king is not exposed. That does not mean there is no king. If some rascal says, "There is no president, there is no king," that is his rascaldom, not that there is no king, no president. He cannot see. He has not that qualification. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One who has no qualification, he says, because he could not see somebody, he sees, "There is no such existence." Is that a good conclusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> Good psychology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal. He is not fit to be seen by the great personality. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot see the sun-god. Does it mean there is no sun-god? What is the value of your eyes? It is imperfect. You are seeing the sun just like a disc, but it is fourteen hundred thousands of times bigger than this earth. Can you see it? Then what is the power of your seeing? Whatever you are seeing, that is defective. So don't be proud of seeing. What is your eyes? What is the value of your eyes? You cannot see even the eyelid. Can you see the eyelid? Although it is attached to your eyeball. So what is the power? Why you are so much proud of seeing? First of all, understand that "I am so defective, I cannot see perfectly, properly." And you want to see God with these defective eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (2):</span> Arjuna also says that he cannot see God. He saw the light only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was speaking with Kṛṣṇa. Still, he said that "I cannot see You." That is a fact. [break] <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you have got qualified eyes, you can see Kṛṣṇa always, twenty-four hours. So we have to qualify, purify. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinir...</span> You are seeing. You are trying to see God as American, as Indian, as this and that. With that eyes you cannot see. When you are neither American nor Indian nor <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> you are pure spirit, then you can see. They want to remain with this designation-body and want to see God. That is not possible. To enter fire you have to become fire. Otherwise, it will be not possible to enter fire. So without Brahman realization, you cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...is the same.

[break] ...God create another ocean in the sky. Then you are God. When there is some tooth pain, you go to the doctor, and you are God. Just see how much nonsense they are. As soon as there is tooth pain, "Oh, oh. Just now I am not God, I am patient." So these things are going on. I have seen so many gods. I have seen one that Dr. Misra. When he had a toothache, "Ohhh, oh." You see? [break] ...cheap philosophy, by misunderstanding the whole world has become atheists, all rascals. Atheist means rascal number one, <span class="Italic">mūḍhāḥ, āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> As soon as one becomes atheist, he is rascal number one. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> ...just in the beginning, when they are in the world, the atheists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atheists, they say that "We have not seen God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> But they need support of God in the beginning. Without that, they cannot go to that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is always. Therefore they are fools. They cannot become atheists. If somebody says that "I do not believe in God," this saying will be stopped immediately by God. He cannot do anything. And that is God. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> When God comes as <span class="Italic">mṛtyuḥ,</span> then all His talking is finished. "I don't believe in God, there is no God," finished. So control that death. Because death takes all your possession, your talking, your riches, your body, everything will be taken away. Now, why do you allow to, death, overtake you? Why do you allow? If you are God, check it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (2):</span> Yes, yes, don't allow your death to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then you are God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> This body is supposed to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why supposed? Why supposed? That is ignorance, "supposed." Because he cannot do anything, he suppose... Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> Of course, we say this body is not say absolute or permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Permanent, but who has made it this? You have not made. You make a permanent body. Then you are God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> That nobody can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he is not God. That is existence of God. You cannot do because there is higher power controlling you. God means controller. He is controlling you. You cannot do that. Therefore you are not God. There is superior controller, who does not allow to do this. You have to abide by the laws. This is common sense reasoning. If you are being controlled, how you become God? God means the supreme controller. Is it all right? So long you will be controlled, you are not God. But where is the position that you are no more controlled? That position is never.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> It is human nature; no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature? What is this nature? Nature is an agency of God by which He controls. That is nature, that "I have got a stick. I can beat you. But the stick is not beating, I am beating." This is knowledge. And the rascal will think, "The stick is beating." What stick has got power?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> Somebody is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Yeah, behind the stick there is my hand." That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣena prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram: [Bg. 9.10]</span> "Under My control the nature is working." But these rascals, they do not know. They think nature is working automatically. Even they accept, but they cannot control nature. Now, how he is God? You control nature. Suppose behind the nature there is no God. All right, you control the nature. Suppose behind this stick my hand is working. You cannot see my hand. But you control this stick, which is beating you, which is kicking you. Control that. So you cannot control anything and you have become God. <span class="Italic">So 'ham, tat tvam asi.</span> These slogans misused, simply misused.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> By our logical research we can come to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and find out Kṛṣṇa is the only person in the whole world who says that "This comes from Me."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> But the teachers give different interpretation of the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The same thing means he is a rascal teacher. He is not teacher. He is cheater. When a cheater takes the place of a teacher, he explains differently. And when a teacher is there, he will explain rightly. Where is the difficulty? I have several times said that "Where is the difficulty to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?"</span> There is not a single line which is very difficult to understand. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam:</span> [Bg. 4.1] "I first of all said this philosophy to Vivasvan, the sun-god." So where is the difficulty to understand this line? Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> No difficulty in understanding. Interpretation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they should interpret? Interpretation is required when there is no understanding. If the matter is clearly understood, why interpretation? This is rascaldom. Everyone understands this is called glass. And what is the use of interpretation? Here is a glass. Everyone can understand. Or spectacle. No, no. This is meaning this. Why? If the thing is clearly understood, there is no question of interpretation. You cannot give. Suppose if you go to the court, if the thing is clearly understood that "This man has committed this criminal activity, he should be punished," so where is the difficulty? No. If somebody... "No no. This 'He should be punished' means not now, after three hundred years he should be punished." Is that interpretation? He should be punished immediately. That's all.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you interpret if you cannot see with your own eyes? You are blind. Why should you interpret? A blind man is interpreting? What is this nonsense? The blind man is just, "Oh, the elephant is big pillar."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (1):</span> Same thing will say that elephant is only trunk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. This kind of interpretation, what is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> They don't have that complete view of the whole.</div>

Let us remain like a fool like that and follow Kṛṣṇa. That's all. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We don't say that "I have got eyes, I have got full knowledge." No, we don't say that. Kṛṣṇa says. That's all. This is our version. We request that "You take Kṛṣṇa. You will be benefited." And actually it is being done. We don't present a false person.
