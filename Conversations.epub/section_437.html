<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the moon planet, there is no rainfall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, according to scientists there is no (indistinct) of rainfall on the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's very hot and very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Have they made another mistake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is no water also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They say that the moon is covered by a very thick layer of dust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But according to our <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> moon is one of the heavenly planets. [break] ...is moon in any way? Because there is no water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say that if they want to set up some houses there, they have to, everything has to be brought there. There's nothing there to use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How the house will be brought there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they plan on in the future building stations and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The water has to be taken from the station?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Air, water, everything has to be taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And still they must go there. And we are proposing another planet, Vaikuṇṭha planet. They are not willing to go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They have found one use for all this space travel. They've decided to... They've experimented grounding lenses, grinding lenses in outer space since there's less dust. They can grind lenses that are more perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Spectacle glass. Good advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's another purpose. Instead of testing bombs on the earth, they are trying to test bombs on the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya<br class="calibre2"/>māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Piśācī,</span> ghostly haunted person, as he speaks so many nonsense, similarly, these persons who are captivated by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> they also speak all nonsense. Ghostly haunted persons. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) What is that? You want to return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> There's a park over there. It's very nice to go to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> The entrance is a little further down the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Over here Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Look up in the sky here and you can see all the different planets and stars. Can you also look up into the sky, the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> and see all the different Vaikuṇṭha planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. The space is three-fourths there. Here the space is one fourth. In one-fourth space there are unlimited number of universes, <span class="Italic">ananta-koṭi.</span> This material world is situated in a one-fourth space, and three-fourths space, in the spiritual world. Just imagine how big it is. There the Vaikuṇṭha planets, each planet is as big as the universe, so big. There are aeroplanes also. It is described in the Second Canto of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> When one looks up towards Goloka Vṛndāvana. Just as the... There's a description in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> of Goloka Vṛndāvana with the lotus petals, corolla of lotus petals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Lotus... These Vaikuṇṭhas are like lotus petals, and the Kṛṣṇaloka is the middle portion, whorl of the lotus. This way? (some talking in background, French) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So their body and your body has nothing to do individually. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...living entities. As soon as there is opportunity, they are coming up. [break] ...as have got experience within this planet there is water. And the watermelons, they grow very nicely in the desert. And you see, within the watermelon, there is water. So wherefrom this water is coming? Hm? Wherefrom the water is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that the world is made up of eight energies: earth, air, water, fire, ether...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says. I am talking you, you are scientist. Wherefrom the watermelon water comes, and they are grown in the desert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say the watermelon has an extensive root system which extracts the water from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means there is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how you can say there is no water in the moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they can take samples in the desert and find out if there is certain degree of moisture in the soil. They have taken the same samples on the moon and say that there is no moisture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why the moon planet is bereft of? Material, anything material, it is combination of earth, water, fire, air, ether. Anything material. It is a combination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, there are probably very minute quantities of moisture on the moon. But they say nothing significant, nothing suitable for agriculture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There are no plants growing on the moon. In the desert we find some plants, but they have not found any vegetation on the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they have not gone thoroughly. One portion of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they have scanners on these satellites which pick up vegetation or life. From hundreds miles away, it will show up on a screen. And they sent it all around the moon, and it hasn't shown any indication of any organic matter or life. They can send this satellite up around the earth planet and they can locate fields of corn, fields of wheat, from hundreds of miles away, just by the way it shows up on these different electronic devices. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take one of these... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The vegetables, made of different elements. [break] ...and they say they found indications of elements that were existing at the time of creation that went into the making of the living entities... (end)</div>
