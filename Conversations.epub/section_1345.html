<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Prabhupāda will let us know. (Bengali) One too hot. Just like the way it was today. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Shrikand.</span> That's very good for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">shrikand.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">shrikand.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a good preparation for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, very nutritious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali with Prabhupāda)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, where is Bharadvāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bharadvāja is here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can sing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Softly. [break] <span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span> says that he has so many nice patients he will not leave. So how he's treating now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have not inquired about that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. His point was that they depend upon his presence for treatment. That means that even if they were to die because he was not personally available to treat them, he did not think that it was very much important in comparison to treating Your Divine Grace. Because they are materialists, so whether they live or die does not affect anything so much. But because you are a great transcendentalist, your presence means that so many thousands of people can be saved. How are you feeling, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not so good. I am passing stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll bring that to his notice. Now that he's here, all of these things can be adjusted. Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he explains that because of the fact that you have not eaten for so many months, all of your inside has become dried up and shriveled, and therefore you cannot expect that you'll be healed very quickly. He says it will take time, but it can be done. As far as your passing stool, you are passing so little stool that it's not very significant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you passed stool once this afternoon and then in the early morning, previous morning, you passed stool. So actually today has not been a lot of stool at all, and it was very small amount.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he was explaining that because everything is so dried up and shriveled inside, now we have to make your body used to taking in foods again and giving off the natural secretions and other juices that are necessary. It takes time. He feels that it's certainly possible, and we certainly hope it is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Turn me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] ...passing is not a very big amount, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Practically it's hardly anything at all. But because it requires for you to be cleaned, therefore you're a little bit bothered by it. Otherwise, in proportion to what you're drinking, it's not unusual. Rather, it's a little healthy, because if you weren't passing it, then we'd have to make it come by giving douche or something. So the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> explained, though, that gradually he has to work on each thing. I'm hopeful, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even though you say you're hopeless. Of course, it's our duty to follow your lotus feet; so whatever your view is, it's our view. But you have to kindly permit us that in this one instance we can have a disagreeing view that although you are hopeless, we should remain hopeful, although it's always our duty to have the same view as you have. Are you desiring to have some <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Or would you like to rest for a while.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I want rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want to rest. So we'll keep it very quiet for a while. I'm just writing some letters, so should I continue to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm in the next room in case you want me. Bhavānanda Mahārāja and Śatadhanya Mahārāja are here. We'll keep everything quiet for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> ...everything was together. But when you add up our sales, whole zones put together, then they're as big as New York and the other areas now. They are doing nicely. They've also brought you some gifts, one sweater and some warm socks and a scarf for the winter here in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So keep it. I shall use it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> He also brought one wooden bowl for eating. They brought one wooden plate for eating also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Where did they put them at?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In the office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That's all right. Someone has got to go and get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> I can bring it. He also said Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, he is in Brazil, but he is returning in a little while.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like us to have <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we've brought some juice, grape juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can sit you up, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That will make it easier to drink. Bhavānanda Mahārāja and myself are here. We can hold you up for a minute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Drink for a minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Only for a minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Should we hold you up for a minute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if I eat here...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Laying down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> The only problem is then the tendency is to take less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's easier to drink when one sits up. We can hold you up. (harmonium and <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is warm now. Hm. [break] What Shastriji said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. I had a nice talk with Shastriji, very detailed talk. He explained that the main... He said we have brought you to him at the very last possible moment. He said had we come six months earlier, so much easier it would have been. He said this time that we have called him just now was just timely that he came back again. He said that the main problem is the kidney. He said the kidney is working, otherwise you could not pass urine. And the medicine which he has given over the past week has had an effect, because the urine is increased. He explains that the whole body, there's very little blood due to not having eaten for so many months, and there's great weakness because of this. He says the muscles are all more or less gone; therefore you have no strength, because the blood is not there. And because you're so weak, he can't give strong medicine, because it will be too strong for you. He has to give it very, very carefully and slowly, in small doses. He says the kidney, urine goes downwards, and blood goes upwards. So the urine is passing. Now he's going to give... He started today already giving medicine which will help to form blood. And automatically... He says that... I asked him, "How will we know if it is working? Will Prabhupāda feel stronger?" He said, "Not immediately. I can't give it very much dose." He said, "I'll be able to tell it from the pulse." I guess that's the <span class="Italic">kavirāja's</span> ability, that he can tell from the pulse. He said, "I'll be able to tell from the pulse that the medicine for creating more blood is being taken up by the body." Then we asked him... He said that it is better you don't sit up 'cause it puts strain on the heart. He said it's better you don't sit up for the next four days or so. Better that you lay down all the time. And that for feeding you, that we can feed you while you're laying down. He said it's not necessary that you take anything solid unless you want it. Liquids are good, he said, for now. Because the whole point is that he has to treat you very, very slowly. There's no question of rushing anything, because you're too weak. He said, if you want solids, that things should not be cooked in <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> There should be no <span class="Italic">dahi.</span> He gave some restrictions-not so many, but some. He said just like <span class="Italic">mālapuyā</span> would not be good because it's cooked with <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> I asked him frankly what he thought was your chances. He said that he felt your chances were quite good. He said the whole point is that... He said of course it depends on Kṛṣṇa. He said, "But the chances are very good. But it will be slow." I said, "But even if Prabhupāda recovers, what does that mean, 'recover'?" He said, "Recover means to be fit." I said, "What about like walking?" He said, "Fit means walking, talking, eating, everything." He said, "If this medicine works, then he should live for at least ten more years." He said that the treatment will take at least three or four months. It's a very slow treatment. He felt fairly confident. He feels there's a very good... He says that he treated one patient who had twenty ulcers, and every single physician said that the man had to die within a week to two weeks. And he made this man take 34 kilos of buttermilk per day, and the man survived. He got rid of all the ulcers and survived. He said he takes your case as very, very serious, though. It's most..., at the final point. I said, "Well, Prabhupāda says that he's dead. Now he says he even feels practically dead." The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> said, "He's not dead. I have seen worse cases even than this, and they could survive. But I have to work very, very carefully. And Prabhupāda should keep good spirits," he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I felt very... I thought that was good, that recovery doesn't mean simply laying in bed for the next few years, but recovery means actually being fit. He says it's gradual. He says, "Now, the medicine I've given for the kidneys over the past week, the kidney has not gotten worse. It's improved a little." He said, "So that..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't strain for collecting. Then spiritual progress will be hampered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Don't strain for collecting. Then spiritual progress will be hampered. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It seems that the temple could be completed within seven years without straining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Then we can have it completed by the five-hundredth-year anniversary of Lord Caitanya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> ...which is in eight years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And the architect at Māyāpura, he said that the temple that's inside the big temple, that could be opened up to the public within three years by having just some type of false ceiling, and then the upper stories, work can go on. That means within three years people could start visiting the temple and using it, which will also be a big inspiration to the public. And then the upstairs and complete outside would be completed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do like that. That is very good idea. And different name, you can purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Each of the..., like <span class="Italic">gośāla,</span> handloom, these can be separately formed into societies, which would be easier for bookkeeping and management anyway, and each of those societies can purchase the land on which their handloom or <span class="Italic">gośāla,</span> whatever is, they can purchase that land in that name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya bhūmi</span> Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Mr. Chowdury tried, but now he's been transferred from the development commissioner. Now he's the transport commissioner. So now all he can do is give us a free... He gives us, tax free, vehicles. But he can't give us the land anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tax free?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Our vehicles in Bengal, we don't pay any road tax. He's the transport commissioner, but he's no longer development commissioner. And if the government gives us some land on acquisition, we'll take. But I don't think they'll give a big amount, neither we should wait for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. That's also utopian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When they see we're doing something, automatically they want to also help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And that bridge is a good idea. Pontoon bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because so many tourists are coming. The local M.L.A., he told me now there's thousands and thousands people coming. This last weekend there was... At any time you could see hundreds of people walking on the road to take <span class="Italic">darśana</span> So now the local man, he wants to build some guesthouse on his own, the government, where they're going to serve meat and other things. That's why our temple, we want to... We're getting our guesthouse all straightened up. If we have a restaurant, then we'll be able to take all the tourist traffic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So why don't you have a restaurant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That was supposed to be done this year, but then Bombay took all the funds. Prabhupāda sanctioned it already last year. It was a good idea. But Māyāpura has become very popular. This is all due to your effort, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Simply due to your efforts Māyāpura and Navadvīpa is becoming so much more famous and popular. We want to make the Māyāpura temple so beautiful and make the city so nice that not only the Queen of England and the President of United States, but even the Russian and Chinese leaders, they'll all have to come to see this. They can't avoid. Will that please Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura? If all the leaders, all these presidents and kings would come and visit the temple at Māyāpura, that would please Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seems like your activities, Śrīla Prabhupāda, are so much pleasing to the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This is the secret you are showing, working towards satisfying the desires of the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tāṅdera caraṇa-sebi-bhakta-sane bās.</span> So you are all <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span> To live with you, to serve the lotus feet of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> that's good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We've already become famous as spiritual United Nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You've given the secret for success. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If possible, make some improvement in Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's birthplace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I was just thinking about that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least repair it nicely, without any claim of our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> From the Bhaktivedanta Charity Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust will be very popular, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Amongst the Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone will glorify your name. It will be a great pleasure to give them funds from this Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Sometime in the future we can, if they are ever agreeable, if we can take the <span class="Italic">sevā </span>of that birthplace, then we should do so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> In Malda district at Rāmakeli, where Lord Caitanya first met with Rūpa and Sanātana, there is a temple of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa that... Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmī used to worship those Deities. Bhaktisiddhānta Ṭhākura Prabhupāda has put a lotus feet of Mahāprabhu there. So we have gone there on two occasions for preaching, and they..., some local people came and said they would like us to take some..., to either take over management or somehow be connected with that because they felt that it required preaching there. They're very favorable at that place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purchase it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When you say Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, that means any of the <span class="Italic">līlā</span> places of Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not just Navadvīpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, in Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about in Jagannātha Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another. That is Orissa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is your great mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you are allowing us to do a little helping to you in your service to the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> We are completely fallen, without any spiritual credit, but still, you are allowing us to help you in a little way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Without your intervention we would have no hope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Jayapatākā's mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is Jayapatākā's mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> She's in California. Citsukhānanda Prabhu said that... (to Citsukhānanda:) You said you saw her in Los Angeles? She is coming to the temple? My mother? What is she doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> She's coming now. There's another lady, Mrs. Forkash, and she has been working with Mrs. Forkash, and she's been attending the programs and also organizing for good publicity for the movement all over America. And she's been attending major functions that we do. Like we had a major function with all the important people of Los Angeles-movie stars, directors, politicians-and so she also assisted, and she was preaching, speaking about Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She's becoming a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> Yes, very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> She's also connected with that Parents for Kṛṣṇa? There's one parent's group called Parents for Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> Parents for Kṛṣṇa, yes. She assists in that Parents for Kṛṣṇa group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is your magic touch, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Anyone who contacts you becomes a devotee. You're just like the associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Whoever saw them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She's already a good lady. Otherwise how she can have such nice son? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> I asked her if she had met you, Prabhupāda. I asked Jayapatākā's mother if she had met you, and she said, "Yes..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A fortunate lady. All your mothers, they are all fortu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I remember some parents used to come, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Los Angeles while you were sitting in the garden in the evening. Once in a while, some parents would come and appreciate you so much that you've trained their sons and daughters to become a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tenants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The parents used to come in Los Angeles in the evening while you were sitting in the garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which garden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> One day you'll be celebrated for saving the whole world, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every day, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I receive so many letters praising Your Divine Grace, how you have saved so many fallen souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Even this <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he said that he has seven patients in Calcutta who are about to die, but he said they're all materialists, so if they live or die it doesn't matter much. So he said, "If Prabhupāda stays on the planet, then so many hundreds, thousands, countless living entities will get devotional service, get liberation, get elevated." That's why he's dropped those patients to come here. You are the most important. You are the pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's amazing to think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that ten years ago you were living in Rādhā-Dāmodara temple and just conceiving all of this. Now Kṛṣṇa has arranged everything. You were sitting alone, having to draw your own water, doing your own typing. Everything you had to do yourself. And now, gradually, the whole world is coming to assist you in serving Kṛṣṇa. It is most wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But still we are not able to serve properly. You have to show us continuously. We are so unfortunate, we are not able to serve you properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Everyone is knowing of your glories, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I was coming in a truck from the airport in San Francisco, and one policeman pulled me over, and he ran an investigation and he came back and said, "I know this isn't right, but do you have any books by Prabhupāda?" So he pulled me over just to get one of your books. And later on I saw him, and he and his friend... He was a sergeant, and they were reading your book at a liquor store.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The policeman pulled him over. He was in a car, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He thought he was going to be arrested, but the policeman said, "I'm pulling you over to ask for one of Prabhupāda's books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He said that he used to go through the airports all the time and get your books, but he hadn't been through the airport in so long, he was feeling the separation. So he had to pull us over, because he saw we were devotees, so that he could ask for some of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> In Los Angeles, at the Spiritual Sky Incense company, there are so many <span class="Italic">karmī</span> workers also assisting in Spiritual Sky business. So actually they are just coming to work every day without any change of heart. But we started... The receptionist started giving <span class="Italic">Perfect Questions, Perfect Answers</span> to the people who work there. And this one man who's a theologian who works there in the bookkeeping department read your book and he said, "This man speaks perfectly. He has no fault. Everything he says is completely right, perfect." So now they're coming to the temple, now, because they've read your book. Otherwise they didn't want to associate. But now they read this book, <span class="Italic">Perfect Questions, Perfect Answers,</span> and they're coming to the temple. They take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They've become very submissive, all the workers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now that your books are being printed in Hindi, in Calcutta, one of our life members, Mr. Tulsan, he got your Hindi <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> and he's begun reading, and now he said his whole life is transformed. He said that never he found anywhere that the knowledge was presented so simply and so clearly. All the <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> he could never understand. So now he's become so enthusiastic he's purchasing four rooms in Māyāpura-two for himself, and he's making two relatives purchase. And every month he comes out with his family, with the whole family. "Instead of going to other recreation," he said, "we'll go to the temple." And he brings big basket of fruit, and he comes out, and they stay for the weekend and they all attend <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four rooms, which side? New?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> New building or the old one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He's going to purchase, I think, two rooms in the old building, and then two rooms in the new building he'll have his friends purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They like the new building also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think we'll have to build more buildings soon, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That long building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda was saying that Tīrtha Mahārāja's brother says that our gate alone is worth all the other temples, that front gate alone. (laughter) When I told Śrīla Prabhupāda that people say that our new building is like a..., worth a whole train, Prabhupāda said, "A double train."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> When one of the Communist papers was writing a critical report about us, then they said that "They even have a building that's longer than the Writer's Building. How they have done this, shamed our state building?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The gate is bigger than the Governor's gate and the building is longer than the Writer's Building. Kṛṣṇa is first. When we build that temple, it will... (laughter) Then everyone will simply be silent. That will end all comment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are already silent. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> Before I came to India, Prabhupāda, one Saturday night in Los Angeles about three weeks ago we had a big <span class="Italic">mahā-saṅkīrtana,</span> big chanting party, because President Carter was coming to Los Angeles. So we got there about thirty minutes before he was coming, and we went with about 125 devotees from New Dvārakā. We went chanting through the street right in front of his hotel room. So he came in from the back way, but it was known to us that he heard the chanting, and all the main people from the government saw this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. We were chanting very nicely, dancing in the street. And everyone was protesting something different, but we were just happy and joyful, and everyone could see that this is positive, this is best thing. Everyone is griping about something, but we are all happy. We have no complaints. So we think that President Carter heard this <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He's supposed to come to India this month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We were noticing now the headline in America in the <span class="Italic">Newsweek</span> or some magazine was that America is going right. Now people are protesting against abortion. They are demanding that leaders be moralistic. It is a whole trend now. And so we see that just because Your Divine Grace has begun book distribution and preaching in the West, in America, that now the people, they're becoming more... Qualities of goodness are automatically coming about just because of your preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> At one big fair, Prabhupāda, we were distributing your books, and after the fair was over so many people were coming up. So we surrounded the truck with stacks of books and were passing them out. And pretty soon after all the books were gone the people started rocking the truck. They were surrounding it, asking for one of your books. They were demanding that they have one of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has come.</div>
