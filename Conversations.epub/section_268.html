<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/> With David Wynne<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 9, 1973, London</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...recently I've heard that the people in the airport protested against Indira Gandhi, that "Give us rain." Yes. That is Vedic civilization ideal. Why there is rain then no rain? The king should be responsible. One <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> lost his son. He immediately went to the king and asked him that "The son has died before the death of the father; why this irregularity? You are responsible." You see? The ideal is that the king is representative of God, because we are all sons of God. We have come here in this material world for our proper guidance. The king is responsible, the spiritual master is responsible, the father is responsible, the elderly persons are responsible. Because you told me that we have to work for other. That other is Kṛṣṇa. If we utilize our intelligence for serving Kṛṣṇa under the guidance of the king or the spiritual master or the father, then the society is perfect. That is ideal civilization. What is your opinion about this? How do you think this ideal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I think it's... I... I... I wonder when it will come. Will it come on this level or what...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately, provided you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately. It is not a question of when. Just like here is light. It doesn't depend there is darkness. You can remain in the darkness and immediately come to the light, and from the light immediately go to the darkness. So, this darkness and light, they are existing, co-existing. It is my choice whether to remain in the darkness or in the light. It is my choice. As soon as you are in the darkness, there is no light. As soon as you are in light, there is no darkness. It is your choice. And this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is light. And anything else, that is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So we can accept either <span class="Italic">māyā</span> or Kṛṣṇa. If you take to <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then you've spoiled your energy and time. If you take to Kṛṣṇa, you utilize your energy and time. Everything is there, ready. You haven't got to create. Everything is there. Just like night is there and day is there. You can keep yourself always in day. Do you know how to do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Keep going round, I suppose. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Nowadays it is not difficult, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Airplane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I started from India at eleven o'clock, and I came here at half past eight, the sunlight was still there. So if you proceed still further, further towards Western side, the night will not be able to come. So you can travel always in daylight. (laughs) Don't allow. It is an example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Why do we choose the dark?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Why do we all choose the dark? Why are we all in the dark, most of us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dark means without Kṛṣṇa consciousness-darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He asked why do we usually choose the darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And most people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Due to bad association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> To...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bad association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, our Society is association. If we keep good association, then we don't touch the darkness. What is that association? There is a song, <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga cari goinu asate vilāsa teka name lagi loma karma bandha phāṅsa.(?) Sat-saṅga. Sat-saṅga</span> means association with the devotees. That is called <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span> So the, one poet, Vaiṣṇava poet, is regretting that "I did not keep association with the devotees, and I wanted to enjoy life with the nondevotees. Therefore I'm being entangled in the fruitive activities." <span class="Italic">Karma bandha phāṅsa.</span> Entanglement. Here in this material world we act, and the result is there. Again we enjoy the result and act, again another result. We act, another result, another result. Because as soon as you act, there will be some result, good or bad. So, good or bad, by good result we get good birth, good money, good bodily features, good education-these are the effects of good work. And the effects of bad work, low-grade family, abominable, ugly bodily features, no education, no money, poor-these are the two effects of material good and bad work. But those who are trying to be transcendental both to the good and bad work, devotees, they are perfect. Because in this material world either you do good work or bad work, you have to suffer the material condition. Just like you are, suppose you are Englishman, you are well situated. But you can not avoid the influence of the weather. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our problem. Either you become rich man or poor man, but you have to undergo. (aside:) Make the light. There is switch. (pause) So our position is that we are in this material world. George has sung that "I am in the material world." Yes, very sensible song. (laughs) He's good boy, realizing, he also... So this material life is not good. Material life is not good in this sense, because you have to change your body. Sometimes good birth, sometimes not good birth. Sometimes Englishman, sometimes cats, dogs. Because after death you'll get a body that will be chosen not by you but by the material nature. You'll create your body by your present activities, and nature will simply award you that body. So, so long we have got this material body, the four kinds of miserable conditions, repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, you have to suffer. Therefore, this human life should be utilized in such a way that we do not become subject to these four tribulations, birth, death, old age and disease. That is perfection. But people are not given that chance, the modern education, modern civilization. They've no knowledge; they do not know that there is life after death, although it is a simple fact. Just like in our present existence we have got past, present and future. Just like you are young man, you have your past. You are a child, or a boy, now that is past. Present, you are young man, and in future you are expecting to become old man. So as you have got past, present and future, similarly, I'm old man, I've got my past life, why not future? What is the reason to deny it? Past, present, future, that is the time calculation. I had my past, I've now present, and why is my future? They do not care for the future. They're so blind. There must be future. So what I'm doing for the future? Just like in this life we collect some money, keep in the bank balance so that in future, old age, I may not be in difficulty. Similarly, what a human being should do for his future life? That he does not know, although past, present, future is there. So this is foolishness. He doesn't care for the future. So one who is foolish, without any knowledge of the future, whatever he's doing is defeated-in ignorance, because it is ignorance. Just like a boy does not take education, does not think of future. That is not very good. We must be prepared for the future, his next life. Yes, where is that civilization? Where is that education, that people are thinking for future life? Is there any educational system at the present moment? So everything is being defeated. <span class="Italic">Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam. Abodha-jāta,</span> these rascal fools, born foolish. He does not inquire about the self-realization, so whatever he is doing, it is all defeat, he is spoiling his time, because he does not know. <span class="Italic">Ātma-tattvam,</span> the science of self-realization. So in ignorance, whatever you do there is defeat. And they're being defeated and they're thinking "I'm victorious." This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very scientific. We are trying to save the living entity from disastrous condition. This is the aim and mission of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not a religious sentiment, no. It is a very scientific. And we have got so many books already printed, and many books coming. Each and every one. You have seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I have seen the one that (indistinct) gave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> he has seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you read carefully, each and all carries volumes of meaning. <span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He's got the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that the Queen was reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> She was looking at...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. Queen Elizabeth was looking, and she gave...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, as far as possible you should help everyone how to be, how to become enlightened about his future. That is real humanitarian work-to save a human being from the future disastrous condition of life. Just like a father thinks of his son, that he may not be unhappy in his future life. So it is the duty of the king, it is the duty of the father, it is the duty of the spiritual master to see that his subordinate is not falling a victim of future disastrous life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Didn't the Queen make some remarks about that? She said something to you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes, she said, "How marvelous it would be to completely trust Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> She said, ah, "What a relief to be able to pass all responsibility to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that one has to learn, how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. The sentiment is very nice. It is just fitting from the royal... Because she's after all favored, she has taken birth in the royal family, so she is not ordinary woman. And her intelligence must be extraordinary. So she has remarked like that, what is that exact word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I think the exact word... She said "How marvelous to be able to give all responsibility to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa is ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes. And she said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the thing is from our side Kṛṣṇa expects something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is not a dead stone. Reciprocal. If you fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa takes full responsibility. If you keep some reservation, Kṛṣṇa also keep reservation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is it. When Kṛṣṇa understands that you have fully surrendered, He takes full responsibility. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span></div>
<div class="Verse"><span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya<br class="calibre2"/></span>mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo<br class="calibre2"/>mokṣayiṣyāmi...<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.66]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Kṛṣṇa is always ready to take responsibility, provided we give. If we think that "Let me do in my own way, and Kṛṣṇa be responsible for my fault..." (laughs) That is not... Reciprocal. Responsive cooperation. Kṛṣṇa is always ready to cooperate. So by the grace of Kṛṣṇa you have got some position. Try to understand this great science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spread it whenever it is possible, whenever it is possible. That will make your life sublime. Yes. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu, an expansion. "Whomever you meet, you just give him the advice Kṛṣṇa has given." Kṛṣṇa has given all an instruction, advice here in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So if you simply repeat, your life is perfect. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Let us say, you are surrendered to Kṛṣṇa you'll be happy. What is the difficulty? If I, you, fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa, and simply ask people that "You also surrender to Kṛṣṇa," what is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Sometimes people ask, "If I surrender to God, give everything to God, then how will the state go on, how will the work, the factories, how would all that go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, Kṛṣṇa is taking responsibility. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> He takes responsibility. Otherwise what is the use of surrender unto Kṛṣṇa? He takes responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (laughs) Just can't go wrong, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> Actually Kṛṣṇa is doing everything. We are thinking, "I'm doing it." We are doing nothing. Just like he has become a famous sculptor. Why you could not? Why, what is the reason? <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am seated in everyone's heart." When He works, Kṛṣṇa says, "Do like this; it will be perfect like this." So Kṛṣṇa is guiding. And everyone is being guided by Kṛṣṇa, even in this condition of life. And when he fully surrenders, how much guidance he will come his way? Even without surrender he's guided. Without His guidance he can not do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do it. Cannot do anything. <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is guiding everyone, even an ant. Kṛṣṇa is giving information, "Mr. Ant, there is a grain of sugar, you can go there." Immediately goes. Otherwise, how he gets the information? For him, one hundred miles away, a grain of sugar, and he goes there. He did not inform. Who informs him? Who informed him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> You feel this very much when one's trying to make sculpture, because it is impossible for a man; one can't do it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> ...one has to wait and be passive...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If Kṛṣṇa withdraws the intelligence, you cannot work. So Kṛṣṇa is guiding already, but He's guiding at the present moment according to your whims. "You wanted to do this? All right." Kṛṣṇa is giving intelligence: "Do it." But when he'll agree to act according to the whims of Kṛṣṇa, that is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> How do you agree to this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> How does one agree to this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have to learn it. In the conditioned state we act according to "my whims." In the liberated state we act according to Kṛṣṇa's whims. That's all. That is the difference. That is the difference. Just see, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Arjuna wanted to act according to his whims, "Oh, He is going now fight with my grandfather, with my teacher." These are the problems. Kṛṣṇa... "No, I cannot fight." And then at last he agreed to act according to the whims of Kṛṣṇa: "Yes, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava. Naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span>" Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Naṣṭo mohaḥ.</span> Whatever we are speaking, there is reference in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We don't speak anything according to our whims. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śrutikīrti:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā<br class="calibre2"/>tvat-prasādān mayācyuta<br class="calibre2"/>sthito 'smi gata-sandehaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kariṣye vacanaṁ tava<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span>Bg. 18.73]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Arjuna said: My dear Kṛṣṇa, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your mercy, and I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There it is. "I am prepared now to act according to Your whims." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When he was trying to act according to his whim, the necessity of instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was there. And when he heard <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he's changed. "Now this is..., all doubts are gone. At last I will act according to your..." This is... Very important verse. Changing. Changing the whole picture. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Same Arjuna, same fighting, same battlefield, everything same, but still everything changed. The consciousness is changed. Externally nothing changed; internally changed. This change is equal for perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So one doesn't have to give up his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Arjuna was a soldier, he was a fighter. The battlefield was there, the war was there, everything was there. He did not... He took to Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not mean he gave up the field and went away. He remained there, but simply the consciousness was changed. He was not willing to fight on his own account. He changed his opinion, "Yes, now I shall fight. By Your grace, my all doubts are now gone." This is required, this is perfection. And there's the picture how Kṛṣṇa is guiding Arjuna. When the ranks are formed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees and David Wynne:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Just here. Just here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> This picture is in George's album.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah, yeah. When I was young my mother died. I was very unhappy, and I read the..., a bit where Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna that "That which is real always exists, and that which isn't real never existed at all," and then I stopped being unhappy. Because this book is..., it tells you everything. (end)</div>
