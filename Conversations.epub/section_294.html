<div class="Normal-Level">(everything is being translated from French by Yogeśvara and <span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...Mr. Belfiore and his wife Mrs. Belfiore. Mr. Belfiore is the inspector general for the French area, Paris area, for the Rosicrucian movement, the Rosicrucian order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that Rosicrucian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It is a very big religious movement all around the world. (Yogeśvara speaks in French with Mr. Belfiore and then translates for Śrīla Prabhupāda throughout) He says our movement is very well known in the United States. Have you never come across our society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the aim of this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The evolution of man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Evolution of man. So man is going to evolve more? What is that ultimate evolution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> To a reintegration of man with the cosmos or cosmic consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cosmic consciousness. We also believe individual consciousness and cosmic consciousness. We are now studying this subject matter in our class. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-kṣetra-jña.</span> So <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña,</span> the knower... The individual soul is also knower, conscious, and the Supersoul, God, is also conscious. So we also admit, universal consciousness, that is God's consciousness. [break]... consciousness is limited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...is studying the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is the evolution, when our consciousness is in agreement with the supreme consciousness. [break] That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that the Rosicrucian order is a mystical and philosophical order that allows its students...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is Rosin? He is a philosopher?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that the term Rosicrucian means, it's an image of a cross with a rose in the center. It means that the disciple is aspiring towards the perfection of his consciousness and that this also means the perfection of consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the ideal of that perfection of consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says it is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Love, that's nice. Very good. So the supreme consciousness and our individual consciousness, when they are in exchange of love, that is perfection. Is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...that this ultimate consciousness is one of union with the Absolute, that it is one of light, of <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> of total love. This is the highest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So love, love. When we speak of love, there must be two persons. (Yogeśvara translates) So what is their philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The love of which they are speaking is a love that binds everything together, that bathes everything in light and love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no action? No action?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No, he says there is action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are those activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Giving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Giving and taking also. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...there is giving. There is also taking. But it's not... The person who has achieved this ultimate perfection, whenever he takes, he immediately gives it to someone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. The transaction between two lovers, one gives, another takes. Sometimes one gives, another takes, another gives, and one takes. This is exchange. Similarly, feeding. I give something to my beloved to eat something. He also gives me something. I eat also. Similarly, I disclose my confidence unto my beloved. My beloved also discloses her or his confidence. These are loving exchanges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that he understands that we are talking of love meaning two people, but does that mean that... Why can't we think of love in terms of an exchange between man and everything, between man and the cosmos?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Cosmos represents, as he says, consciousness. That is the person, consciousness. Just like if I love a tree, I love the leaves and twigs also. If I pour water on the root of the tree, it goes to the leaves, twigs, branches, automatically. So if we love the supreme consciousness, Supreme Person, who has got universal consciousness, then automatically my service goes to everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is also what their philosophy is, he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot love everyone and anyone or everything without finding out the original source of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The Rosicrucian order is a school that teaches its students to progress step by step towards that ultimate source of all sources.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that step? What is that step?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says it's a gradual progress, that their students come, they receive initiation and then they are guided. They are given certain principles, certain practices, and then gradually, at their own rate, by their own powers, they ultimately arrive at perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that ideal of perfection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That it is <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa,</span> it is the kingdom of Lord Jesus Christ. He says it is the ultimate point for which all men are ultimately striving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that? <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa</span> means zero. Everyone is trying for the zero?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa</span> means something different for them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] He says it is an entering into something that is alive and real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa,</span> this word is Sanskrit word. <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa</span> means finish. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> For them the word <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa</span> means an end but an end to this material existence and an entrance into the silence of the Absolute, onto a level that is real, whereas this one is false. This one is rejected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why silence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says the term "entering into silence" is a mystic term that means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot explain. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...it is undescribable because it's something that's arrived at inside through meditation. You can't really describe it in words?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? You are describing so many thing in words and the ultimate goal you cannot describe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that many great masters like you from the East tend to smile at their explanations, but he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They tend to smile when this question is asked, "Who am I?" So what can I say compared to these masters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means his knowledge is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> His knowledge is not perfect, and like us, he is simply trying for perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So unless you have got your goal perfectly known, how you can make progress? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...their organization is the guru, and their whole organization knows the ultimate goal which they can attain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is part of that organization. He does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> He says that evolution of man which is the goal of this order is something that is mystical. It is not scientific, that it is so easily...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is pale. It is not distinct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he is surprised that we raise such objections. He thought that we were also searching for something mystical. He says he's heard our chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who, who? Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He said he thought we were also searching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we have got definite goal, Kṛṣṇa... We have got definite goal, Kṛṣṇa... [break] ...Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has got His form, He has got His place, He has got His name, He has got His pastimes, and we want to enter in that kingdom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that he thought that in our movement we were following Ramakrishna who had discovered everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Ramakrishna we kick out. We don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he's not familiar personally with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramakrishna is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that this is not a new order, this Rosicrucian order. It goes back at least as far as Ancient Egypt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you do not know what is the aim of your this progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says all he can is repeat to you his answer previously, which is that (it) is to reach the perfection of consciousness at which point man is in communion, in unity with the beyond. He calls it the <span class="Italic">cela</span> (French), "the inexplicable."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he cannot express what is that beyond. But he cannot describe what is God. That is imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that communion with God is something that is subjective; it's something you experience, not that you describe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that according to every individual's place of birth, his age, his upbringing, he will experience this communion with God differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. God is God. If the experience will have to be taken from God, then it will be equally most possibility for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says what they are looking for in the Rosicrucian order is the ultimate realization when all these other relative communions with God will disappear and there will be one common realization, experience of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. But if you cannot describe what is that ultimate goal, then how others can be attracted? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...but in their society they have many different religions, many different groups, and they don't ask anyone to leave being Christian or Jew or Muslim or Hindu or anything like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are not asking in that way. We are asking, "What is that ultimate goal?" [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...ultimately, by following a process that the Rosicrucian order gives its students, one reaches the goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Suppose if I am going to London. So unless I am interested to go to London, what is the use of knowing how to go to London?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Their students feel the need for this ultimate perfection and that's why they come to the movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he does not know what is ultimate perfection, this is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...realization of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Just like if I say that "If you do like this, you can make one million dollars." But you know what is the value of one millions dollars; then you endeavor. But if we don't know what is that one million dollars, why should we endeavor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No, he said, all of their students, they know the value of realizing God in their heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do they know? How do they know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There are already people who are aspiring after a richer, more spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that spiritual life? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...high spiritual values, the things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are simply words. What is the spiritual life. I want to know. [break] ...is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says when God. He is just using a lot of names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is simply speaking. He does not know what is the aim, what is the goal, what is spiritual life... [break] ...no tangible knowledge of everything, what I ask. As I asked you what is spiritual life, he cannot describe. [break] ...distinguish between spiritual life and material life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break]... as we can have spiritual realization and still live in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is the spiritual life? What is the distinction between spiritual life and material life? What is the goal? He cannot define Spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break]...want to know how does a person who is realized the perfection live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...tolerant. Above all, he is tolerant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tolerant. Spiritual life. That is also spiritual life. That's all. So in their way of spiritual life, what are the process? There must be some process, definite process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...that comes when you become initiated in the movement. They give you the process for arriving at this tolerance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But suppose I want to enter. So you must give me some formula that "You have to do this like this." Otherwise how can I enter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says there are many different techniques, but ultimately they are really all the same because they lead to the same conclusion. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...those techniques? Let him say some of the techniques.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says the first thing is that we have to awaken our internal consciousness which is ninety percent asleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I don't care to talk about them here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how can I accept it? I cannot enter into some vague thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> All the systems have to do with meditation, concentration, things that will reawaken your consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the object of meditation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...different objects, many different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But tell one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The body for example. [break] He says that there is "the eternal meditation number three."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the number one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that this one is one that's basic. It is given to all their students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Number three, and no number one. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...wants to say that you will meditate on the number three and this was that you would wake up the consciousness in your body starting from the tips of your toes and working up like this. And it may seem easy to you, but all the great masters of the Orient have taught this and no one can succeed without doing this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means their knowledge is not perfect. It is all bogus. [break] ...if you meditate on the body what do you gain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> To wake up your psychic consciousness which is sleeping inside this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you tell me, what is that process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Well, "meditation number three" is to... [break] He says he would like to talk to you a little bit about a book he is reading which describes how the Russians have just discovered the soul. They have photographed the soul, he says,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French guest devotee:</span> No, no, the aura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...how they have, the Russians have found the soul and they have described all the different phenomena of para-psychology and extra sensory perception, and he said it's an incredible book, and the Russians have made great discoveries. He hasn't finished the book yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Russians. I am asking him about his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that the Rosicrucians they know what is the duty of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The destiny of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga: :</span>...the soul is a state, of crystik consciousness, <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa,</span> call it what you will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That cannot be described.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...with an understanding that is a million times beyond our understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is beyond understanding, how can I accept it? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...understanding, and it is translated onto the objective level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I do not understand whom to love, how can I learn?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> It is in the heart of everyone. Simply it is a question of repressing the false ego for, eliminating the old man, the false ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I'm not quite sure. He says that he doesn't understand why you are objecting. He says love is a part of everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because if you ask me to love, I want to know what is, whom I shall love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> A mystic, he loves everything, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any example?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> An example is the master of their movement. He was supposed to come, but he was on vacation. But the grand master of their movement, he says, is one example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, suppose to love everyone, that means you love the animals also. Their community allows, animal killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> When you come into the movement, there are no regulations required of you. But little by little, it comes to that point. Their experience is that they give their students in the movement... For a short period of time, they are required to give up intoxication and meat and things like that. But it's not permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then they can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why in the beginning stop? Why in the beginning they are requested to give it up? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Rosicrucian order doesn't force anything, doesn't make you do anything. [break] ...people that join this organization, only seven succeed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it cannot be preached among the mass of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Some people, when they just can't make it anymore, they just (indistinct) flip out. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says all movements experience the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That out of one hundred people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One hundred people..., but the ideal must be there. One may follow or not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Their order doesn't reject anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think... Whether their order approves animal killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There are no restrictions. The order doesn't require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let us stop here. No more questions. Waste time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He doesn't like the idea of killing animals, and he has advised that to friends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is the ideal of the order? That I am asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Love between men, understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What the animals have done? No brotherhood is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he loves the animals. He has many animals living with him. He is surrounded by animals, he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. [break]... a person who is habituated to kill animals, so will he be admitted in the order?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> He doesn't think that someone who kills animals would like to enter, but if a butcher wants to enter, that's okay, and gradually they'll elevate him. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...on principle the order does not allow animal killing, is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They would rather not see anyone killed. Ideally, on an ideal level, their movement would not want to see animals killed, anyone killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I want to know what are the principles, rules and regulation of the order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Their principles are love, beauty, harmony, peace. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> He says there are no rules, but as you progress, one initiation after another initiation, if you start out as a butcher, then gradually in your own self, you will wish to give it up. But there are no rules. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...one initiation after one initiation, there is no progressive rules?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...that are steps, but the order itself doesn't require that you give up meat-eating at any point. He says he thinks that the people themselves would probably give it up in the higher stages. He says that their order has a very smart way of doing things, that if they were to try and tell people, "Don't do this, don't do this, don't do that," right away, nobody would join them. So they don't say that. [break] They fall away gradually by themselves. [break] ...quotes a passage from St. Paul who said if you go and visit someone who is a meat-eater, don't trouble him. Accept meat with him. The real mystic is someone who has controlled his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he cannot explain, how to control the body. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...it happens right away, it will happen in awhile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, I cannot accept this. [break] ...if there is definite program. [break] The thing is that if I want to enter your association, you must give me some prescription which if I follow, I'll make progress. So that is another thing. But you have no prescription. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara: :</span>...submit to his grandmaster your request for a specific prescription to be given to you. He'll send in your application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He hasn't got. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...make one special just for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But not for general people. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...is that Yogeśvara explained the four principles to this man, so the man said, "Yes, very good. Sometime we can get to that too, but it is something that on our own we accept personally. Just like you yourself, Your Divine Grace, you have come to this by accepting it yourself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, "These are nice principles that you are following and we are sure that you have come to these conclusions on your own, just like maybe one day we will come to those conclusions on our own also." They are something that is self-initiated, these regulative principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So for the time being there is no such rules and regulations? In their order. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...makes certain suggestions, but it doesn't oblige anyone to follow their suggestions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that suggestion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The movement suggests that people live a life as perhaps yours is, of purity, and pure thoughts and moral living and even following certain principles of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these things are there, but they don't say. Suppose a man is killing animals. They don't prohibit him. Then that is immoral life, but if they don't prohibit him, then how he can become moral? [break] ...killing of animals and morality will go together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's an order that likes very much the ideals of beauty and harmony and morality, but they can't see imposing on anyone these things. I guess their idea is that you can't impose beauty and morality on anyone. You can't insist that anyone stop killing. You can't tell anyone forcibly not to do this or not to do that, that these are things that you have to realize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But is there such rules and regulation or injunction from the society that "You do not kill." Just like Bible there is, "You shall not kill." So they have no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says Jesus ate meat and furthermore there is a sect in the Orient that wears gauze over their mouth so as not to kill microbes while they breathe. But we are killing those microbes. We have killed these flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are to satisfy everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Don't you think we are killing other living beings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...study everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) They haven't got their own anything. Simply they are studying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Realization is what counts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that he cannot explain, what is the realization. If you cannot describe, then what is the realization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he is only forty-nine years old. He can't describe it for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> He knows the Rosicrucian order is good because everything he has attained in his life, he owes to the order. So he knows it is good by what he has attained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But I think for mass of people, unless they have got some ideal, how they can join? That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> [break] ...devotees think, think, "Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. [break] ...realize what he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If he had not realized something, he would never have come tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Then therefore he can describe what he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says when Moses saw the burning bush and he asked the fire, "Who are you?" The fire said, "I am what I am." "Who I am?" that's a question that you are going to have to answer by your own meditations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is his meditation? What he has learned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The thing to realize, which he has realized a little bit, is peace. And when you join up, you get a letter back, and at the bottom of the letter it says "With our best wishes for your peace and happiness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that's all right. Everyone wants that. But what is the process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...by praying, courage, by faith. A serious movement, a serious order would never guarantee instantaneous illumination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that also we say. But we must have the program. Just like he say that "Who am I?" So at least one must know who he is. If this vague reply is "I am what I am..." If I ask you, "you come," so "Who are you, sir?" then if he says, "I am what I am," is that the proper answer? (laughter) This is nonsense answer. If I ask you, "Who are you?" If he says, "I am what I am," is that the proper answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He would tell you his name, Mr. Belfiore. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> ...that forms his identity is Maurice Belfiore, but the interior, that reality, is different. [break] If we all join up here now in silence and we enter into ourselves and create one person, then we will know who we are from that silence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how it is possible to become silent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...many, many births and deaths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's all right. That's all right. Now talk [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...privilege for him to be here amongst us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Thank you very much and he is going to tell the grandmaster about you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in San Jose, California, their grand emperor of the movement has his, their headquarters. And he said one day perhaps there would be the opportunity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got our temple. (end)</div>
