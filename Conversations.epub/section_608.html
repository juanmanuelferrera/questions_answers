<div class="Normal-Level">(In car:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So bullet expected also? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> All great leaders, they live in constant fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syāt.</span> Everyone, animal up to the king of heaven-always fearful. <span class="Italic">Ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca.</span> So fearfulness is one of the qualification of conditioned soul. Yesterday you were putting forward the logic, "Machine." Machine, we also accept. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is mentioned, this body is machine, <span class="Italic">yantra. Yantra</span> means machine. So at the same time, you said, "Growing." Do you grow machine Ford car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Do they grow? No, they... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how the analogy is perfect? Machine it is. That is accepted. Kṛṣṇa says. That is undoubtedly, it is machine. It is nothing but machine. So machine, at the same time, he says, "It grows." How it can be comparable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The body is compared to a machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not... It is machine, not compared. It is machine. Actually it is machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But then it cannot grow because a machine does not grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> So it is changing every second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like this is a car, machine, but if I want a bigger car, that means another car, not this car is growing. Suppose sometimes you get baby car. That is not sufficient. I want big car. So you cannot say that increase the baby car and it becomes a sedan car. That means you require another big car. A child, a child cannot have sex in that body. The same child, when he wants to enjoy sex, he must have another body. So these rascals, they cannot understand how different machines has been supplied by nature. It is supplying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, I think it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you want another machine, immediately it is... <span class="Italic">Svābhāvikī bala-kriyā ca parāsya śaktir vividhaiva.</span> His potencies, his merit, is acting. Not his merit, means the nature's merit, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">,</span> it is working so swiftly. You cannot see. The same example as I give always, that the movies spool, each is a different picture, but when it is put into the projector, you cannot understand. But actually on the background there are different pictures. So if ordinary cinematograph, cinema picture, we can make like that, how much nicely and subtle machine is there, it is being done-that you do not know. But each body, each second, you are being supplied a different body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like each of the different frames.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> On the film each frame is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Each picture. But what appears to be a complete...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in one picture you will find hand is here, another picture hand is here, another hand is here, but when they are taken together, it means the hand moves. The example is there. Each picture is a different picture. As soon as you stop it, the hand is here. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> So each second the body is a little different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Each second the body is different. But what this rascal will do? How they will know? They have no brain. All dull-headed materialistic, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> They cannot understand this. But this is the process going on. I want, for certain thing, I want a different body. Immediately nature supplies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Even within this body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why within? Another body you cannot see. Not within-without. Another body supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Sometimes when people are put into a dangerous situation, they acquire extraordinary strength, just like that, that they never had before. So it's like they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You must expect according to your quality. Just like if Kṛṣṇa wants, He can make something else. But you are not independent. You are dependent on nature, and your position is very insignificant. But Kṛṣṇa can, as soon as He wishes-immediately done. <span class="Italic">Parasya śaktir vividhaiva.</span> Just like in Bible it is said, "God said, 'Let there be creation.' There was creation immediately." But you cannot do that. But if you... Whatever you are desiring, nature is supplying you. Kṛṣṇa is also being supplied by nature, that is spiritual nature. And you are also being supplied by the material nature. So both nature is working. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra... [Bg. </span>3.27]. Each stage is a different form. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The scientists say that every seven years the body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not seven years. A medical man says every moment the blood corpuscles are changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Are different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. New blood cells are coming into being. So you cannot say machine growing. That is fallacious. A machine, new machine. (Everyone gets out of car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> New machine, <span class="Italic">jaya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as I want a smaller car, not smaller car, I want bigger car, smaller car also. That is change. Whatever you deserve. You desire; at the same time, you deserve. First deserve, then desire. Just like these rascals, "I desire to become God." That kind of desire will never be fulfilled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> It's according to the qualification also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Your position is very minute. So you can desire up to that limit, not that you can desire "I become complete, universal." That is the defect of the Māyāvāda. "Because I am equal... <span class="Italic">So 'ham.</span> Because I am qualitatively one, therefore I am one in every respect." A drop of ocean water, if he desires, "I become ocean," that is not possible. But a drop of ocean water contains the same ingredients as the big Pacific Ocean. So in your quantitative proportion, if you desire, that is your perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Understanding one's position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That's sensible. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Like in the Tenth Chapter it's talking about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, not come very near. Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's talking about that Arjuna saw the universal form, all these universes and all that. So does that mean like you were talking that one can't become a universal being, but he can see the whole universe. Can you explain how that is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that? You can see the universe; that does not mean that you can become universe. You can see the sky; that does not mean you become as big as sky. [break] ...small, minute shining sparks, minute combination. So they are also shining, but that does not mean they can become as good, as big, as the sun. [break] ...the defect of the Māyāvāda philosophy. They think of themselves too much. Therefore they remain here, always in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...abuddhayaḥ,</span> means the intelligence is not purified. They are called <span class="Italic">aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ</span> or <span class="Italic">viśuddha [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">,</span> "without purification of knowledge." [break] <span class="Italic">...kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādṛta-yuṣmād-aṅghrayaḥ.</span> They fall down. [break] ...this symbol?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Some fountain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are some children, symbolic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They're looking at the water. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...written, "Danger." Now they are going to the safety. What is danger, there is that safety. Now, what is danger and what is safety?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That means it is relative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything is relative. Therefore it is called relative world. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's according to the body. Because the duck has a particular body, the water for him is safety, and because we have this particular body, it is dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...true that when you become more purified that you will see everything differently with your eyes and hear everything differently with your ears and all this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We won't see things the way we perceive them now, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are suffering from cataract, how you can see distinctly? You have to get your eyes operated. Then you can see. So our <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> process is simply purifying, purifying, more, more, more. When you are completely purified, you see God face to face, eye to eye, talk with Him, play with Him, just like cowherds boys, they are playing, the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are dancing. You get that position. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> ...You said in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> speaking about Dhruva Mahārāja, that his senses became enlivened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Senses are there. It is purified. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> process is completely, complete process to purify you. Other process are not. <span class="Italic">Karma, jñāna,</span> yoga cannot purify you cent percent, but <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> process can purify you cent percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what's the difference between a Brahmavādī and a Māyāvādī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you already questioned. We answered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I did?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...vādī means those who are aspiring to merge into the impersonal Brahman effulgence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And Māyāvādīs, they do not attain that impersonal realization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāvādīs remain fools forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They never leave this material platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know. They have no knowledge. <span class="Italic">Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">,</span> always impure. Otherwise how they are thinking, <span class="Italic">so 'ham:</span> "I am same. I am God. I am moving the sun, I am..." Such rascals, they remain always in ignorance. [break] ...no sense that "If I am the same, then why I have fallen down in this <span class="Italic">māyā?"</span> They say, "It is my <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> I have become dog. So it is my <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> I have become hog. It is my <span class="Italic">līlā.</span>" (laughs) This is their philosophy. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Māyāvāda. They are fools, <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> They are described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Māyāvādī means <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā:</span> "Their knowledge has been taken away by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" Fools. Either you call them fool or call them lowest of the mankind or the most sinful, whatever way you can call, they are like that. All good qualifications. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has warned, <span class="Italic">māyāvādī-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa:</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169] "If you hear from Māyāvādī, then your spiritual life is finished." It's so dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The Brahmavādīs have some possibility of advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What is that thing that enables them to advance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you will know later on. First of all try to understand this. Don't try to understand everything in a moment. That is foolishness. [break] That argument is clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That if you call it a machine, how the machine can grow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The machine is changing at every second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say two things: "Growing" and "machine." So that is incomparable. Machine cannot grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...many machines. You get another machine, another one, and another and another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have changed so many machines. So death means another machine. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> When the spirit soul leaves the body, the body continues to change, it deteriorates?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Spirit soul is changing machine. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So when this machine is finished, and another machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The old machine continues to change after the spirit soul leaves, it deteriorates? The old machine deterior..., it breaks down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. You give up one machine and you take another machine. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...one goes into a subtle machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That example is given, <span class="Italic">vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya</span> [Bg. 2.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like your dress, when it is useless, you throw it away and take another dress. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya gṛhṇāti naraḥ aparāṇi.</span> You accept another set of dress. Clearly explained. [break] ...also very scientific. Just like according to your last life's desires, you have got this dress, this body. So it is going on, going on, going on. Now you are creating another set of desires in this life. So you require a different dress. Then you begin another satisfaction of your desires. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Karmāṇa daiva-netreṇa: [SB </span>3.31.1] by your <span class="Italic">karma,</span> you are creating a situation. Just like the criminal, he has created a situation; he cannot live anymore outside the jail. "Come on, here." He will go in automatically. So they do not know how nature is working. It is clearly said, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Nature is working, and that nature is working," <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10],</span> "under My superintendence." Everything is there. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram. Jagat,</span> it is changing, always changing. How it is changing? Under the direction of God. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Only Kṛṣṇa is doing everything then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa is not like you that when you are given some business, you become embarrassed. That is the difference between Kṛṣṇa and you. He never becomes embarrassed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it true that our advancement in devotional services... Is it influenced a lot by our past <span class="Italic">karma,</span> how many sinful activities we have committed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not under <span class="Italic">karma. Bhakti</span> is under your good will. If you accept to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, you can do that without being checked by anything else. Simply you have to will, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa. You are asking me. So long I did not do. From this day I do." That will depend upon you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Not that if I was more sinful, I would make less advancement than somebody who is more pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you may be, simply surrender and everything is finished. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣ...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. Even if you are sinful, Kṛṣṇa will give you release, "All right. You have surrendered. That's all right." That is wanted. If you reserve something and cheat Kṛṣṇa, "Now I am surrendering," Kṛṣṇa is very intelligent. "You have still reservation. No." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...it's easier to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa</span> one can see, one can understand his position. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Does he experience the miseries of the gross body when he's in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> in the mode of goodness? Does he experience hunger and thirst, those things like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gross body means no hunger?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When a person's in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> he's not so much feeling the pain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not disturbed by the <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.</span> That is <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa. Naṣṭa-prayeṣv abhadreṣu [SB 1.2.18].</span> He can be disturbed by <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,</span> but when he is in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> he is not so much disturbed. And if he increase and go to the pure <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, suddha-sattva,</span> then he is no more disturbed. At that time he can understand what is God.

This thing will be finished when you are strongly situated in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> Then you go advance more and more. [break] ...hear about Kṛṣṇa, to chant about Kṛṣṇa, means cleansing, cleansing the dirty things of <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa.</span> [break] ...world is going on on <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa.</span> Very minute quantity of population are by <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Perhaps only in India will you find people in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, some. That is also deteriorating.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You were saying that when one is in the mode of goodness, that he is on the mental platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Does that mean that he's not... He's experiencing the subtle body inside of the gross body, or what does that mean exactly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mental platform is mixed <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa,</span> not pure. But if you keep always Kṛṣṇa in your mind, then you are purified. The mind has no other opportunity to keep anything else. Kṛṣṇa is sitting there, then guarantee. [break] ...they keep always seeing Viṣṇu form within the heart. Therefore they keep in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> Similarly, if you keep Kṛṣṇa, then you are in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> And when that concentration on Kṛṣṇa is not disturbed, then it is <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva.</span> That is spiritual platform.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is purified. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is the purifying process. I have already said. Not that the eyes are suffering from cataract disease, "Pluck out." That is Māyāvādī philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> What does that mean, then, when the yogis withdraw their senses from the objects like it says like the tortoise withdraws his limbs within the shell? What does that refer to then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that? I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He asks, in the yoga system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yoga system means always see Supersoul; that is real yoga system. Perfection. <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">. Yoginaḥ,</span> being meditating and seeing the Supersoul, this is yoga. Not that he does not see. He is seeing Supersoul. He is seeing nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He doesn't see the Supersoul with the gross senses, though, does he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pure senses. He does not... Impure senses and pure senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> How can you tell when your senses are getting purified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will understand Kṛṣṇa more and more. So long your senses are not purified, you will not understand clearly what is Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...understanding Kṛṣṇa means detestful to the material world, attached to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavaḥ viraktir anyatra syāt.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Is it true that eventually by this process we'll become purified so we can become like <span class="Italic">śruti-dharas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you will see when you become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then we will actually attain that condition, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Try to become purified. Don't imagine and guess, "What will be the condition when I am purified?" This is all nonsense. Try to become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then you perceive it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You tell the story of the potter. He has many pots. (Prabhupāda laughs) And he tries to imagine what it will be like when he becomes very wealthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense, waste time. [break] ...you are eating you will understand yourself, "Yes, I am eating, I am getting strength, I am getting satisfaction." But simply theory..., "What will happen after eating? What will happen?" You eat and you see what is happening. What is the use of asking this question? You eat and you will understand. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...Harrison, he wrote in his preface that "The proof of the pudding is in the eating."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So he recommended everyone to take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...daily, <span class="Italic">guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā</span> **<span class="Italic">,</span> what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> <span class="Italic">Cittete koriyā aikya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ār nā koriho mane āśā</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So guru, your guru has said that "You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, observe these rules." Do that, don't speculate, and you will understand everything. [break] ...daily</div>
<div class="Verse">guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya,<br class="calibre2"/>ār nā koriho mane āśā **</div>
<div class="After-Verse">No speculation, do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Can you explain exactly what speculation means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Speculation means thinking, "What will happen? Maybe like this, maybe like this." That is speculation. [break] ...speculate, "Kṛṣṇa may be like this. Kṛṣṇa may be like this." That is speculation. When Kṛṣṇa appears before you, you see, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is like this." That is wanted. And if you speculate, "Kṛṣṇa may be like this," it is all nonsense. Come to the stage when Kṛṣṇa will appear before you, and you will see what is Kṛṣṇa. Be qualified to that position. Māyāvādīs, they are speculating simply, "God may be like this." Why "God may be like this?" God is factual, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...plane crash took place in John Kennedy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So such a big... simply by touching the electric wire that becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, they were, I think, steel towers, two hundred feet high, so they were pretty sturdy, and it hit four of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> There was some bad weather.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And then it toppled over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in bad weather, towers, but simply by touching, such a big machine became in fire. (laughs) Unsafe everywhere. <span class="Italic">Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadam [SB </span>10.14.58]<span class="Italic">.</span> Every step, there is danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One of our devotees... I was speaking to him. He was formerly in the air force, an electrician. And he was saying how there are so many wires in an airplane, and actually, when he was electrician, they would put the wires together very hastily in order to get the job done. And he said one of those wires could go wrong and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Finish everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He said the tendency is when you have a job is that you try to find some shortcut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So everyone is looking for that some shortcut, how to do it quicker, faster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...working sincerely? Nobody. In the material world they cannot work sincerely. [break] ...experienced when any enterprise goes under government supervision, it immediately spoiled. Nobody work sincerely. When it is a private concern, one is sincere because it is <span class="Italic">his</span> business. If it goes wrong, he will suffer. But when it is government concern, they become irresponsible. That is the experience. Immediately, "Oh, my service is secure. I cannot be kicked out suddenly. So I may do or not do." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> In Russia they will shoot you if you do not do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, but there is the tendency, "Do not do." Therefore there is shooting. (laughter) How can you check it? (end)</div>
