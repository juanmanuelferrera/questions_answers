<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he said "Hare Kṛṣṇa"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee (1):</span> Yes. "Hare Kṛṣṇa." He said "Hare Kṛṣṇa." And he told me that "You come later on, and we will sit and talk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go and sit and talk. What is his grievance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> His wife is very devoted. She has a small Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. She is... (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> He is a very dirty man. His wife sometimes likes to give even a little flower, and she is afraid he will beat her if she gives anything to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...sign? Rāmacandra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Garuḍa and Hanumān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Rāmacandra, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Garuḍa, and Hanumān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Unnecessarily there are so many parties, and they fight one another. This is democracy. Today is <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the moon it can be made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> [break] ...then the sun, it must be bigger than the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This moon planet must be a bigger planet than the sun if it's further away, because it appears bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It does not look bigger than the sun. May be bigger. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...<span class="Italic">Kalākendra.</span> So many <span class="Italic">kalākendras. Kalā</span> means cheating, <span class="Italic">kalā.</span> In Bengal, when it is called <span class="Italic">kalā, kalā deki dichi</span> means cheating... (Hindi) I think in other countries also somewhere, they do so, that "I cannot do anything." Eh? In your country do they not like showing this thumb?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> what does that mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India it is. Means "You are useless. You could not do anything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Good morning, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. There are so many <span class="Italic">kalākendras</span> but no <span class="Italic">kendra</span> for understanding <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> Huh? <span class="Italic">Apasyatam ātma-tattvam [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">apasyatam.</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">ātma-tattvam,</span> these rascals. <span class="Italic">Gṛheṣu gṛhamedhīnam. Apasyatam ātma-tattvam [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> These rascals, they do not know <span class="Italic">ātma-tattva,</span> the science of self-realization. <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-maninaḥ.</span> They have been simply external. They are giving importance to the music, but the person who is playing the music, he has no information. He is thinking this tongue is vibrating music, such a rascal. If the tongue is vibrating music, then why-he is dead-why the tongue does not play music anymore? And the ear is there. Why he does not hear any more music? If this body is all, then the body is there, the tongue is there, the ear is there-why there is no response of the music? <span class="Italic">Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> And these rascals, they do not know who is the person who is singing and who is hearing. Therefore they have been called as <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Who is singing, who is hearing, he does not know. <span class="Italic">Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛhamedhīnam [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You were saying in Mauritius that they are imperfect and they are taking advice from the imperfect. Therefore very difficult for them to understand, because they don't take advice from the perfect person, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...<span class="Italic">apaśyatām.</span> They cannot see. They see only that the tongue is vibrating, the ear is hearing. And the dead man, the same ear is there, the tongue is there. Why there is no music? What they will answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> They say it's a chemical interaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that chemical? Eh? Why talk nonsense? Chemical reaction? Bring that chemical and let him hear again. What is the answer? Why do they say nonsense which he does not know? Chemical reaction, if it is chemical reaction, bring chemical and inject it. What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That chemical is very complicated. They haven't found...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you do not know. First of all admit you are talking nonsense. The chemical you do not know. Still you are talking nonsense. Therefore you are rascal. Why do you talk nonsense if you do not know? What is the answer? If you do not know, why do you talk just like wise man? Then you are a nonsense. <span class="Italic">Aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś... [</span>Bg. 2.11]. You are talking like a very learned scientist, but you are a rascal, fool. Challenge them like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> They think that today they do not know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They think."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> ...but tomorrow, they think, will know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another rascal point. Therefore I say, "Kick them on their face tomorrow." He's offering postdated check. (laughter) Eh? Even if you are coming of a very millionaire's family, but if you give me a check postdated, shall I accept it? A sane man? No. Bring cash; then talk. (laughter) So these rascals, they have no cash. They have got only paper, postdated check. And who will accept it unless one is another fool, rascal, another rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> They are bluffing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Bluffing business goes on when there are many rascals. You can bluff the rascals, not the intelligent man. Who is cheated? One who is a rascal, he is cheated. Not the intelligent man is cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They should have their salaries paid by postdated check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they will not accept that. That they will not accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "In the future we will pay you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> When you find the chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Now you starve. In future I shall pay." "How shall I eat?" "Now you starve. In future you'll get payment." You do not know what is the chemical, how it is acting, and depending on your future knowledge, and still, you are talking like a very great scientist. This rascaldom should be stopped by kicking on their face. Huh? So? Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, do you agree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. [break] ...if they know the chemicals, why they open deaf and dumb school? Let the chemical be injected and they will be cured from dumbness and deafness. And where is that chemical? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I mean, after all, isn't it just a matter of time, because we've already invented new skin now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again rascaldom. Again rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but just think of what we've already done. We've made new skin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you have done? What you have done? A man... A man is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I tell you, we've made new skin. If somebody gets burned we can put new skin on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A man, when he is blind, what you can do? You can simply make some experiment. Then you say, "We tried. We could not do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Ah, but now we're putting in new eyeballs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That cannot see. (laughter) That is another... So how they are bluffing, just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In Russia they've made dogs with two heads. They've put another head on a dog in Russia, and now the dog has two heads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Such advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Such advancement, a two-headed dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eventually they're going to try to have men with two heads. They first experiment with animals and then try it on men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Rāvaṇa had ten heads, and he was killed in spite of ten heads. Still, he could not save himself from the hands of Rāma, although he had ten heads. He thought that "I have now ten heads. Who can be more intelligent than me?" And still, Rāmacandra proved, "Yes, I am better intelligent than you." [break] ...Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...even though we're here. <span class="Italic">Kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that, here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said there's a <span class="Italic">kendra</span> everywhere, <span class="Italic">kalā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kalā</span> means this. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Ei kalā.</span> [break] Prabhakara was working here. He was employed here. He was staying on that room, so I also stayed with him two days. [break] ...count of his unsteadiness he has lost so many good jobs. I do</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">not know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Some man was telling me that... One M.P. was telling me that there are many criminal cases against him also now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How did you find that out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> He told me. I don't know why. This Dr. Lokescandra? He told me that "Ācārya Prabhakara has many criminal cases against him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Which way we have to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There was a poster on the wall, said they are opening a big exhibition of Russian books in Punjab, and the chief minister, he is going to open that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Big exhibition of Russian books. They are teaching the Russian (indistinct) all over India. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you exhibit our books? Let them come to competition. What books we have got, compare with our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What they say is that this philosophy is very old. They say that this philosophy is very old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we are giving old wine in new bottle. If it is old, why the up-to-date Western boys are taking? It may be old for you rascals, but those who are intelligent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They think that they are frustrated. They have nothing more to do except this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they take this? Why not your philosophy? Why they take this philosophy? Why not the Russian philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So they are going to take. That's the reason they are putting the Russian books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, lots of people take the Russian philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are exhibiting here in India, but why in Europe, America, they are not taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But there are many Marxists in America. Like on the subway...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many Marxists, there are many capitalists. That is another thing. But why the Russians could not make everyone Marxist in spite of so much propaganda? What is the basic principle of Russian philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> What is the basic principle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Follow the teachings of Marx.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What is that teaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everything belongs to the state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The worker is supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everyone should work for the state, and the state will distribute fairly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> The basis of the philosophy is that matter is supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> And all matter is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Matter is supreme. Then why the matter does not move independently?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> That they have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then another rascal. If matter is supreme, why don't you combine matter and let it move. So what is that supreme which is moving this matter? If they do not know, then again a rascal, in spite of so much philosophy and so much communism. Why, when Stalin and Lenin died, they simply remained matter? Why it was not moving? Where is that matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That they are working on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again the same rascal. Again another rascal. They are working; therefore we must be satisfied. Postdated check. How you say all these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, their philosophy is just a social philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, it is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They say, "From everybody according to their means and to everybody according to their needs." As you work...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why there are so many enemies? Why the Americans do not like them, Chinese do not like them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Now they write in the mod... I see in the modern textbook in the Delhi schools. They make counterproposal. They said, "Because the Indian philosophy is not so perfect, India has become economically backwards on account of following the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What economical backwards?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say India is very poor country.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Indians economical backwards because they have given up their own culture. When India was actually standing on the old culture, they were never defeated. Even the Mohammedans, they ruled over India for eight hundred years, but they could not defeat the Indian culture. But the British government are clever. They spoiled the Indian culture. Therefore they are poverty-stricken. Otherwise if India would have continued in his own culture... The Gandhi started the boycott movement. So Indian culture automatically boycotted anything foreign. We know in our childhood nothing foreign-made could be used in some ceremony. Even this cloth, it must be country-made, that, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Khadi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Khadi,</span> yes. No mill-made cloth can be used. That was Indian culture. They would not touch even foreign medicine. Dr. Bose, Kartick Chandra Bose, he told me that "You do not know how much we had to flatter to accept this British medicine." They would not touch quinine, anything foreign-made. This was Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, the basic flaw with Indian culture is that some people are very rich and some people are very poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Then why in your country there are hippies lying on the street? Why? Why they have accepted poverty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's a temporary thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India is poor and rich, and why they are voluntarily poor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That was because they were all intoxicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you cannot say that there is no poor. There is voluntarily poor. You cannot say there is no poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, in our Russian system we are trying to abolish that poor by making, take money from the rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again that, "We are trying to abolish," the postdated check again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> In Russia, everyone is poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But at least they're equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, when you become poor, then naturally it is equal. There is no rich man. Naturally you become equal. If everyone is fool, then everyone is equal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But everybody in Russia is so strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that strong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They can lift all kinds of weight and fight very strongly. Very strong people. So they're not starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they are stronger than the lions and the elephant? Are they stronger than these animals? Are they? Are the Russians stronger than the elephant and the lion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But they're stronger than the Europeans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the lion is better than them. The elephant is better than them. Why do you call them, "They are animals"? They are better situated. One lion can kill hundreds of Russians. Then lion is better than the Russian? You have to accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I mean, but they're not poor because they're so, you know, they're well fed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There everyone is poor, begging. You are talking theoretically. I went to Moscow. The taxi driver was wanting something excess. They are so poor, begging, "Give me something more." They are so poor. Most of the people, they are walking on the street. There is no taxi. Nobody can pay for taxi. This is their situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but why should somebody be rich and I be poor? What gives him the right to have money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere. That is called, that... He is born in a rich family; I am born in a poor family. So why this is happening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, that's unfair. I mean, I should take his money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not unfair. This is nature's arrangement, <span class="Italic">uccavacca.</span> Why one has become animal? Why one has become man? The same living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again rascaldom, "chance." Who is making this chance? Can I make you by chance a dog? That is not possible. There is no such chance. It is by <span class="Italic">karma-phala. Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ.</span> The chance is that you are rascal, fool; you do not know what chance will make me what. Just like you infect some disease; you suffer from that disease. So this happens to the rascal. One who is intelligent, he does not infect. He is always cautious. Therefore this chance of infection is not there. Actually you cannot say "chance." It is your ignorance. You create chance. Because you do not know what will happen after something, on account of ignorance it is chance. But if you are fully aware, there is no question of chance. An intelligent student, he does not think, "By chance I may be passed." He reads properly. He appears in the examination, give the proper answer. It is not chance. And if he thinks, "All right, by chance I will be passing the..." Is it very intelligent? These rascals are talking like that. There is no question of chance. On account of ignorance they commit something infectious, and they suffer. And because they cannot explain, they say it is chance. It is not chance. It is due to some cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually Marx was very expert at giving economic causes. For example, he said that they would start off with this capitalistic system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what Marx has explained that a man is born in a rich family, from the birth he is millionaire, and another man is trying whole life, but he could not secure more than his provision? That's all. Why this is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's due to the capitalistic system. Because he is born in a certain kind of a system, then this hereditary birth and wealth comes. But that capitalistic system, if it's more in a socialistic or communistic system, then there is no possibility of that happening. So therefore this inequality doesn't exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are trying for the last fifty years. Why the capitalism is not yet gone? Fifty years at least. They started their movement in 1917. Huh? So how many years? More than fifty. Sixty years. Sixty years. What they have done, progress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, actually, Russia was the wrong place for communism to go. According to Marx, Russia was the last place that should be communistic, because it was agricultural. But the first place should have been like England,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they did not do that? Another rascaldom. Why you are taking chance in Russia, the foolish country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So that when if a country like England or America would become communistic, that would be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why would become? It is not the dictation of rascal Marx. Why they would? Why he is expecting like a fool like that? Why they would accept that philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, they will have to accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when they... That is another thing. Again, "they will have," future. Again rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because just like New York has gone become bankrupt, so all the cities will go bankrupt, and then people will not have employment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Bankrupt does not mean their philosophy is lost. Bankrupt may be due to some other reason. That does not mean the capitalistic philosophy is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, actually the communistic philosophy is strictly economic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not actually. Don't say "actually." Sometimes you say "accidentally" and sometimes "actually." Such a rascal. (laughter) "By some chance" and sometimes "actually."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Marx's point was that the different systems, they would deteriorate one into the other, and eventually all these countries would have to... They would just evolve into that communistic way of life. That was his, his idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, then when there will be no capital, naturally they will be communistic. That's all. Nothing to eat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So it's just some... It's not a philosophy but it's a position that one has to accept out of desperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> that they will be embarrassed with so many problems. That is not a communistic idea. That is the future of <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga.</span> That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam. Āchinna-dāra-draviṇā gacchanti giri-kānanam.</span> They will be harassed by famine, taxation, and starvation. Naturally they will be disappointed. <span class="Italic">Āchinna.</span> That is already told.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Marx, he studied history from a given point and then he just calculated the consequences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that point is not new point. It is already stated five thousand years ago. So what credit he has got? If I say, "Now you are thirty-four years. At the end of hundred years you will die," is that discovery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No. But that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But for this he's got so much credit because he said this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he gets credit from the rascals and fools. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually, his philosophy is not something that can be put into action, but he's simply predicting what will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we can say also from our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> That is not a very new thing. Those who are rascal, fools, for them it is new thing, and those who are student of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> it is not new point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I think Plato also predicted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We noticed this year at the book fair that they gave so many stands to the Communist publishers. There were at least ten or fifteen stands. And formerly they were not even allowed. They were not allowed. There was not a single one. Three years ago there was not a single stand which had Communist literature in the book fair, and this year there must have been fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a worldwide trend towards communism today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a worldwide trend towards communism. In Europe, communism is becoming very strong. Italy has almost become communistic. Communist party has captured...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> Portugal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Portugal, there's a struggle going on. Even in France the Communist party is very, very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Disappointment. Disappointment. People are becoming more and more poverty-stricken. This is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They are forced to accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The European economic problem is failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually this oil crisis has been of great help to the Communists, because because of this oil crisis the world economy has fallen, and as people become frustrated, more and more people are turning towards communism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what the Communist has done for the world benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's a nice philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India there are many Communists, but the price of foodstuff increasing daily. What they can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, they say "If we were in power, this would not happen."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you become in power? You are strong. And what they have done, those who are already in the power? There is no food. One has to give line for two hours to get foodstuff. I have seen in Moscow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They don't have any food. They have to buy from the United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> Importing from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, importing India, America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> They don't have any bananas, mangoes, nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this rascaldom is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> People are so foolish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people here... In the Moscow I have seen, they have no choice. You have to take whatever government supplies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There is no food in the market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to eat something-everyone has got desire-you cannot get. You cannot get. There is no fruit; there is no flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> When I was there, all we could find was some potatoes, some beets, and some cabbage. That's all. Nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Very poor country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But also in Russia you can't grow many things. It's very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But you can import.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore naturally they are condemned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So when you put the communistic system somewhere where you can grow these things, it will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You take that system and put it in a place where you can grow all these things. Then it will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you bring communism, you will not be able to grow. You are condemned immediately. Nature will restrict supply. Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Left, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> China is doing very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not Russia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, China has more facility to grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of Russian philosophy if he has no facility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, actually it's not Russian philosophy. Chinese philosophy. I just read a report from French reporters that went into China. They say China is growing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is not accident. There must be some cause. Why do you say accident? Can you say "Accidentally Chinese are better situated"? Why don't you accidentally you become better situated? Then there must be controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Mao Tse Tung.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Mao Tse Tung.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever it may be, if one is better situated and another is not, there must be some management above that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They say their great nationalistic spirit is holding together the country. They have a great nationalistic spirit. They are very loyal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That spirit is there amongst the dogs. (laughter) That is not very great qualification. The dog has also: "Oh, <span class="Italic">yow</span>! Why you have come here? <span class="Italic">Gow! Gow! Gow!</span>" That is dog spirit. This dog is going peacefully. As soon as he will see another dog, immediately fight begin. Who is this (sic:) Coppernics?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Copernicus. He was a scientist. Ancient... well, long time ago. He was the one that first said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He made a model of the universe, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that scientific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He made a model of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> With the sun in the center. It was a revolutionary idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He used to sit on top of his roof and think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And fell down? (laughter) What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another (Hindi) <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again. All <span class="Italic">kalākendra,</span> this <span class="Italic">kendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's so many next to our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Next to our temple there's so many <span class="Italic">kalākendras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> <span class="Italic">Kalā</span> has another meaning of "art."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...people engage in academic <span class="Italic">kalākendra,</span> and the price of rice is rising. No rice. Rice <span class="Italic">kalā.</span> "My dear <span class="Italic">kalākendra,</span> can you supply me rice?" "No." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> In Bombay, even if any businessman brings more than five kgs of rice, they will seize him. They search the baggage many times in the trains at the station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see. This is the <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There was a political cartoon that people were shouting for food to Indira Gandhi, and the minister was saying, "The people want food." And she said, "But tomorrow we're going to have television."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Television. <span class="Italic">Kalākendra.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">kalākendra</span>? This big house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Rabindra...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rabindranath. Oh, he is the foremost <span class="Italic">kalā,</span> Rabindranath Tagore. He has shown biggest <span class="Italic">kalā</span> to the people of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Aurobindo <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo <span class="Italic">kalā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Very big. He spent a lot of money for that Victoria House.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But nobody is coming there, here or there. They have big, big Rabindra <span class="Italic">kalā</span> and nobody is trying to taste it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When they have programs, a lot of people come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... You make any dog dance; they will come. That is not... In the name of Rabindranath Tagore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That may even be Rabindranath Tagore dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> When the dog is dancing, it may even be Rabindranath Tagore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rabindranath became very popular on account of his introducing Māghmela, where young boys and girls could easily meet. Yes. (aside:) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> It's "Women in the World."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughter) What is that "Women in the World"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Sixteen-ounce brain, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had a world conference of women in Mexico recently, where every country sent a delegation of women.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, nowadays we're doing that also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Stones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kalā</span> means craftsmanship. Why it is not here, lacking? No money. The <span class="Italic">kalā</span> cannot be shown without money. I never saw New Delhi in such nasty condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> It's deteriorating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very much deteriorating. It means finished. The <span class="Italic">kalā</span> is finished now. You see? Now, "Natural History." So many dead stone they have brought, and so costly building, and showing "natural history." This is going on, simply cheating and bluffing at the cost of poor man's blood. Against this principle the communist movement is good. There are so many buildings, but there is not a single building where spiritual culture is discussed, although it is the real basis of life. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...and not getting sufficient milk, their growth is checked. This is <span class="Italic">kalākendra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have powdered milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is simply cheating, powdered milk. It is white water, that's all. Powdered milk means white water. It has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In Moscow too, Anand Shanti, he was telling. When we were there we wanted to buy milk, and they had milk in bottles, but he told me, he said, "This is not milk." He said "First they dehydrate it, make it to powder. Then they again add water and put it in the bottle, because in this way they can keep it a long time." So we couldn't find any real milk even in Moscow, the biggest city in the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think Moscow they have milk and butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> At least when I was there we couldn't find any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then finished. All cows finished, cutting throat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Butter they have, but it's not very good quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Adulterate. I thought at least they have got little milk and butter, but that is also finished. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> ...the milkman tries to bring the cow to the <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> they arrest the milkman. They take his cow away from him.

Either you may bring this <span class="Italic">ism</span> or that <span class="Italic">ism,</span> this civilization will collapse. People will become mad, being harassed in so many ways.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Or he starts a war.</div>
