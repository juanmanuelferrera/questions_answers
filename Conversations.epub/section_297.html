<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...Sanskrit at the University of, at the Sorbonne University here in Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No, in fact, in the University of Marseilles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Marseilles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> In the southern part of France. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can show our books, how Sanskrit we have written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says we can show you our books. These are some of the publications of our society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Set all the books. Let him read the Sanskrit portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's the translation of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Each word. Just see how we have translated. You are Sanskrit scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> This is the first volume. Are you preparing more of them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are preparing sixty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, that's wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's a good thing. You know that the first translation of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> in any European language was in French in the beginning of the Nineteenth Century by a French scholar called Brenelouf. Yes, it was wonderful translation. But just a plain translation, without commentary. I am sure that your book is more valuable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can see my mode of translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see. You open anywhere. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, and you have also a commentary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Commentary, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> ...of your own, which is most formidable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not my own,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but through the disciplic succession. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> In that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> From Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Śrī Kṛṣṇa. You can open the Fourth, Fourth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> published by MacMillan Company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You open the Fourth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Do you think that your mission is successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is to be judged by you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh! That's interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is the verse here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yeah, Yes this is the verse. People told me that you have some two or three thousand disciples in the Western world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Two or three thousand disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> More than that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> And what about France? Is it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know. They know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> They know, yes, better than you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They bring the disciples. I simply initiate. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Have you been many times in France or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the third time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> The third time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Formerly I was going there... What is that place name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Fontenay aux Rose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Fontenay aux Rose. I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In a sewer. So I had got very poor idea of Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Really? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in the sewer, I could not see such nice things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Here, it's a wonderful location.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Here it is wonderful. Now I can make an idea, what is Paris. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Surely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was under impression in Paris there is no nice park. Now this time I see, yes, Paris excels the whole world, having such a nice park. Yes. I saw Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. That is also very nice. But this park is nicer than Golden Gate Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> You think so. The Bois de Bologne? is much better than the Golden Gate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Well it depends. I like the Golden Gate too because there is the sea not far. Here, in Paris, you have no ocean, nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Only a small river. That is not the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And on the whole, Paris city is very nice. Very nice. Opulent city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> And they told me also that this morning you had some brahminical initiation to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> <span class="Italic">...Gāyatrī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> How many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's good. That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Seven <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and ten first initiates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the whole, fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Fifteen, seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventeen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> How many levels of initiation do you have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Two. The first...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First initiation, experimental...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Then, as he practices, becomes more purified, then second initiation. <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī. Gāyatrī-mantra.</span> But the first initiation, according to Jīva Gosvāmī, that is sufficient. Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> that is sufficient. But still, to purify them more, the second initiation, <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī,</span> is given. So we are creating <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> in the western countries. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes. I know. Don't you think it's against the <span class="Italic">dharma-śāstra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No. Tell me why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is nothing, such thing as <span class="Italic">janma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh. Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And another place, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> there is statement of Nārada, advising Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira that <span class="Italic">yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam.</span> There are symptoms, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> system, <span class="Italic">śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ kṣāntir ārjavam</span> [Bg. 18.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam, abhivyañjakaṁ varṇa. Yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta tat tenaiva vinirdiśet</span> [SB 7.11.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the injunction of Nārada, "The symptoms, brahminical symptoms, if it is found in the person who is born in a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> family, he should be accepted as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And if the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> symptoms are visible in a person born in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, he should be accepted as <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span>" And in the <span class="Italic">Jābāla Upaniṣad,</span> the Satyakāma Jābāla... So Satyakāma was born of a maidservant, but he wanted to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So he went to Gautama Muni: "Sir, make your disciple." In those days, Vaidic brahminical culture, without becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he cannot be initiated. Initiation means to make one <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So, according to our Gosvāmī process, Sanātana Gosvāmī, he has given us the book, <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.</span> In that book he has written,</div>
<div class="Verse">yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti<br class="calibre2"/>kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena<br class="calibre2"/>dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Nṛṇām: "Of all human beings, by initiation, he becomes a <span class="Italic">dvija.</span>" So we follow that principle. And besides that, Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered that <span class="Italic">bhārata-bhūmite...</span> You understand little Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No, Bengali, no, I don't. But it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is almost Sanskrit. "Anyone who has taken birth as human being in the land of Bhāratavarṣa," <span class="Italic">janma sārthaka kari,</span> "making his life successful," <span class="Italic">kara para-upakāra. Para-upakāra. Para-upakāra</span> means everyone is in slumber and considering himself that he is body, like cats and dogs. Therefore, they should be raised to the spiritual consciousness that "You are not cats and dogs. You are Brahman." Just realize <span class="Italic">"ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span>" This is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> So we are doing that. We are awakening everyone. <span class="Italic">Uttiṣṭhataḥ jāgrataḥ prāpta-varaṁ nibodhata:</span> "You have got now human being form of life. Now get up and make your life successful by spiritual realization." This is our message. <span class="Italic">Sarve sukhino bhavantu.</span> By spiritual realization everyone will become happy. Without spiritual realization, nobody can become happy. This is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Indian caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they are against me, against me. They come to fight with me that I am spoiling Hindu religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> (laughs) Well, you are a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I am now <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This is a statement of account from the Central Bank of India. It just arrived from London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (pause, opens letter) Any other letter? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's all. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So just see how we have translated. You are Sanskrit scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> You know the <span class="Italic">Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, I have made a translation of it into French. It's under print now at the present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad?</span> That is Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yeah, that the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> That's the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You mentioned that to Professor Stahl in your correspondences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You mentioned that in the <span class="Italic">Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad</span> the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is specifically recommended to counteract the contamination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it is translated by you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In French?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> In French, yes. I'll send you a copy when, when it's out of the press. It is not a fact at present. Well, I thank you very much for being kind enough...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If you have questions, you shouldn't feel shy. You can ask whatever you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No, why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He has already questioned once, that I am making <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa-</span>whether it is according to <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's the usual question. That's not the first time this question has been asked to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is... We do not do anything which is not in <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> So this <span class="Italic">Jābāla Upaniṣad,</span> this Satyakāma Jābāla, he went to Gautama Muni for initiation. So Gautama Muni asked him, "Who is your father?" He replied that he did not know. "So ask your mother." The mother was asked also. She said, "No, I do not know." He came to Gautama Muni and said that, "My father's name is neither known to my mother nor to me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, yes. I know this story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he accepted that "You are a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>" because he is talking truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> The truth, <span class="Italic">satyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> The sign. It's a well-known story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, by birth, a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is not made. By character.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, I agree with that. And what about girls? Do you initiate girls? Or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Do you initiate girls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So many girls. <span class="Italic">Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya.</span> Give him, Paṇḍita Mahāśaya. </div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br class="calibre2"/>ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.32]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Just like Gārgī and... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Gārgī. <span class="Italic">Etad viditvā yaḥ prayāti sa brāhmaṇaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's rather remarkable if one takes into account the fact that most of us come from backgrounds which had nothing whatsoever to do with the standards of brahminical culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's right. Yes, that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We were, we were steeped in all kinds of bad habits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, according to Vedic injunction, the Westerners are <span class="Italic">mlecchas, yavanas.</span> You know better than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni.</span> And therefore, Kṛṣṇa says... What does He say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br class="calibre2"/>ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.32]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, although they be of lower birth, women, <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> merchants, as well as <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> or workers, can approach the supreme destination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In another place, in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> I think Second, Second Canto... Find out this verse: <span class="Italic">kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> We publish these with nice indices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, yes, yes. It is so strange to have an index. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Index, there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> <span class="Italic">Śloka-sūcī.</span> Yes, there is index. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Uh. "Kirāta.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Andhra. A province in Southern India mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhīṣma-parva</span> of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> It is still extant under the same name. Pulinda. It is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata, Ādi</span> 174.38, that is the inhabitants of the province of the name, Pulinda. This country was conquered by Bhīmasena and Sahadeva. The Greeks are known as Pulindas, and it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vana-parva</span> of the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> that the non-Vedic race of this part of the world would rule over the world. This Pulinda province was also one of the provinces of Bhārata, and the inhabitants were classified amongst the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> kings. But later on, due to their giving up the brahminical culture, they were mentioned as <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> just as those who are not followers of the Islamic culture are called <span class="Italic">kafirs,</span> and those who are not followers of the Christian culture are called heathens. Ābhīra. This name also appears in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> both in the <span class="Italic">Sabhā-parva</span> and the <span class="Italic">Bhīṣma-parva.</span> It is mentioned that this province was situated on the River Sarasvatī in Sind. The modern Sind province formerly extended on the other side of the Arabian Sea. All the inhabitants of that province were known as the Ābhīras. They were under the domination of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and, according to the statements of Mārkaṇḍeya, the <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> of this part of the world would also rule over Bhārata. Later on, this proved to be true, as it was proved in the case of the Pulindas. On behalf of the Pulindas, Alexander the Great conquered India, and on behalf of the Ābhīras, Muhammad Ghori conquered India. These Ābhīras were also formerly <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> within the brahminical culture, but they gave up the connection. But the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> who were afraid of Paraśurāma and had hidden themselves in the Caucasian hilly regions later on became known as the Ābhīras, and the place they inhabited was known as Ābhīradeśa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Oh, but for those who cannot read the English, there's necessity in French.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Quite. Oh, yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Many?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Ten or twelve times in French?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says there are ten or twelve different French translations of the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In English also there are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, English, more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> English, more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So now we wish to present the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> <span class="Italic">As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without interpretation. And, according to the trades manager of MacMillan Company, our book is topmost selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Than all other editions. Their report is. They, they print at a time fifty thousand copies. So three or four times they have already printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Since last August, within one year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Wow. That's a great success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are out of stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Out of stock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> So they will print it again, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will print it. They will supply in August or July, they said. They'll supply. So it has come out very successful. Just imagine, 200,000 copies distributed within one year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> In one year. That's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in America, our people go to <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> Many gentlemen comes down, gets down from the car, inquires, "You have got Bhaktivedanta's <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is?"</span> They purchase like that. Yes. At least, they have become inquisitive on account of the word <span class="Italic">"As It Is."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">"As It Is."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">As It Is,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Because of the fact that our title is <span class="Italic">"Bhagavad-gītā As It Is."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> "<span class="Italic">As It Is."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "<span class="Italic">As It Is.</span>" Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have read different interpretations. Now they want to read as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's fine. That is fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What, what is your opinion about interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Well, it's much better to have a commentary separated, not an interpretation given mixed with the translation. It is not to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not good. No. Yes. We cite them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> It has to be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you have got your own opinion, you can write your own book. But you cannot interpret on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, that's right. You are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the authority of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is gone. But everyone is doing like that, even Dr. Radhakrishnan and others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes. I already know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Even Gandhi has done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Gandhi also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi. He has also interpreted. He has interpreted, "This body... Kurukṣetra means this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But he didn't write it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, it is not widely read, but this has become a fashion, to give his own interpretation. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yeah, that's right, the fashion. That's the word. That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa was not a so, I mean to say, ignorant, that He left something to be interpreted later on by another rascal. No. That was not Kṛṣṇa's intention. What Kṛṣṇa says, that is final. So we accept in that way. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we appeal to the people that "You think of Kṛṣṇa. You become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa." All these disciples, they have been taught like that. "You offer obeisances to Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī.</span> "You worship Kṛṣṇa." That's it. And by doing that, they are advancing. Advancing. And before me, for hundreds of years or more than that, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was known to the European and American countries. As you say, there are so many trans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But not a single soul became a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. There is no history. Yes. So far we know, that by reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is meant for making a person devotee of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> But before my coming here, so many swamis came, and they preached on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> so many scholars came, but not a single soul became a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, because other... So, for instance, you have the Ramakrishna Mission...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What the Ramakrishna mission has done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramakrishna mission has done this, that they have learned to drink wine and eat meat, that's all, from the Western countries. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes. This is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is their contribution. And they have spoiled the Hindu culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh. Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Because Vivekananda said, "Oh, what is the harm there, in eating? You can eat whatever you like. It doesn't matter in religion." It was the first. And he himself was eating anything. So all the Ramakrishna mission <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> still, they are eating meat, egg and everything, especially in America. Yes. Fish is no consideration. That is daily affair. And the turkey,... Yes. Instead of preaching here, they have taken the Western method. And Vivekananda's preaching is like Western missionaries-open hospitals, school...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> You are right, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He had no spiritual knowledge. So therefore it has not been successful. They are preaching in the Western countries... As far I know, in America they have got ten or twelve branches. I am working for the last six years only. I have got already fifty branches. And each branch, there are devotees like them, not less than twenty-five, up to two hundred, three hundred, all dedicated souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> And what about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't take account of these because they are not standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not standard. We are following <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> standard, and they have got their own manufactured way. So we don't recognize them. Our process is <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Paramparā.</span> What Kṛṣṇa said, the disciplic succession will say the same thing. But they are speaking differently. So therefore we don't take them as bona fide. They are not bona fide. And from external point of view, we have got so many literatures, so many branches, so many devotees, within six years. But they haven't got such thing. Even Ramakrishna Mission. They are working for the last eighty years. And I have worked only for six years. And my result is eighty times more than them. They also acknowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>

Our manuscript is ready for sixty volumes but we are gradually publishing. Already we have got about twenty volumes, different kinds of literatures. Yes. Show all the books. You have seen our books? No.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> These are nice paintings as well, you'll find in here. Yes, all done by the devotees. Some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> This <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> is a summary study of the Tenth Canto, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> the intimate pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, two volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The other book is <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion.</span> It is translation from <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> of Rūpa Gosvāmī.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> It's about that, or is it a translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is summary study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Summary study, yeah. Well, the books are well-printed and very well... I like books like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is summary study of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We also have now the complete <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> being printed by our own presses in New York City, with the original Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got the manuscript printed? Not yet. No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Such wonderful books...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone likes. Yes. Even Christian priests they also like. No, any sane man will like because... Somebody sends me money: "Sir, you are doing so nice work, spreading God consciousness. Here is my little contribution."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. From your, these Western countries. Just week before, I got hundred dollars from one gentleman. Simply appreciated that I am spreading God consciousness. So actually we have no program of proselytizing or making Hindu from Christian, Christian... We have no such program. We simply want to see that everyone is God conscious. Never mind through which venue, he becomes a God conscious. It doesn't matter. That is the verdict of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">You read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> "Translation: The Supreme occupation, <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is self-satisfaction. <span class="Italic">Yayātmā suprasīdati. Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> So the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is open for everyone. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yeah, but people following you, could, could they stay in normal life, I mean have a business, etc...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why Not? There are so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> You, for instance, do you do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a householder. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> You are still working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I design books and magazines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Where? I mean, in connection with this society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I do work for the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But is it possible to work outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. We have many professors. They're being outside. But one thing is that after being interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they cannot remain outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That's it, the point, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they don't find any suitable place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes. But this gentleman told me that he is married, for instance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is married. So we have got so many married couples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Your wife is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> In the same society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> And in the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She also translates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> My wife translates, and I design the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> So do you think it is possible, for instance, to have the husband being involved in this movement and not his wife?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, wife also involved. Everyone is involved. The child is also involved. You'll find in our class a small child dancing to the tune. Yes. We have opened one school for children in Dallas. All the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha-bhaktas,</span> those who have got children, we send there. Have you got pictures of Dallas? So there we have got very nice building, and, about, for the present, about near about hundred students. They're simply taught Sanskrit and English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing else. Later on, little geometry, geography, mathematics. They're not meant for outside work. They're meant for as soon as they learn Sanskrit and English, they'll read these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I see. But to get the initiation, you have to be how many years old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ten to twelve years. That is the Vedic system. Twelve years old. He can be initiated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, yes. It is the same as the <span class="Italic">upanayana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Upa</span> means "near," <span class="Italic">nayanam,</span> "to bring." <span class="Italic">Upanayana-saṁskāra.</span> And the sacred thread means that he has been accepted by the spiritual master by bringing him near to spiritual consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> So at the time of initiation, you not only give the <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī-mantra,</span> but also the sacred thread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just we have given <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī-mantra...</span> You have got that paper? Yes. Show him. Give him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> More, I cannot take. It's not possible. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...Kṛṣṇa, in His childhood. You have seen the picture, Lugdu Gopāla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Lugdu Gopāla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are therefore going to Kṛṣṇa-to taste lugdu with him. Lugdu,<span class="Italic"> </span><i class="calibre3">kachorī</i>... From that <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book...</span> You can find out that picture.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Kṛṣṇa again expanded Himself into so many cows, calves, friends. Then Brahmā thought that he is defeated.</div>
