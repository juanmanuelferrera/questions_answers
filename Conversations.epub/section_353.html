<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not our life, to become an impostor. It must be real person. By training, <span class="Italic">yaḥ śāstra-vidhiṁ siddhiḥ,</span> by training under the teaching of a bona fide spiritual master, the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> and then you'll automatically, the more you become a sincere, I mean to say, servitor of the spiritual master, the more you become qualified to become a teacher in the future. Otherwise where is your qualification? You may cheat others that you are teacher, but you are not actually teacher. You have no lesson, no education. A cheating is another thing. But practically to become a teacher... Just like in a school, teacher... A teacher is appointed. When the certificate is there that he has passed M.A. examination, and he has undergone the training, B.T., Bachelor training, then he's appointed: "Yes, you can be a teacher." And then a bogus man, he can be... He cannot be accepted as teacher. So that is going on. A bogus man, they're becoming teachers. Therefore the world condition is so degraded. A cheater is taking the place of teacher. Therefore the whole world is degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee:</span> If we have a desire to keep these promises, but we have a hard time to do it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you fail to keep your promise, then you're fallen. You have to rectify yourself. Immediately you're fallen. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na sa siddhim</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> That means you'll never get perfection. You'll fall down. You can cheat others that "I am in dress of a devotee, so I am..." What is your character? What is your actual value? That has to be judged. That is call bona fide teacher. All right, chant. (brief <span class="Italic">japa</span> chanting) Any questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, one more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is the exterior clothing important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is the exterior identification important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, important. Just like officially the policeman must dress, but a policeman sometimes in ordinary cloth also, that's his duty. But that is special case. But external, external dress is also required. By... In the dress of a police if he is a thief, that is very dangerous. That is very dangerous. Just like this dress of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> saffron cloth, one will respect that "Here is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" But if he is a thief in a dress of a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> that is dangerous. That is dangerous. One must dress... (end)</div>
