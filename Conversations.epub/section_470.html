<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Thank you very much. I am so too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recently we have published one booklet. It is written by one scientist, my student, <span class="Italic">The Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Thank you very much. It is translated in German too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. This is just... I received a sample.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Ah, yes, yes. Who is author, Svarūpa Dāmodara dāsa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is my disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Ah, yes. From India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is in Cali... His description is there in the last page, his photograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Oh, yes, I see. Vaiṣṇava, Manipur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He (indistinct) his MS from Buffalo University and his Ph.D, chemistry from California University. And he graduated himself from Gauhati University. Very learned scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, yes, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are coming from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Near Passau, say, I think five hundred kilometers from here, with train, yes. I am coming yesterday in the evening to Frankfurt. In the morning I came to here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You can stay here. We have got place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, tomorrow, till tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He has a room upstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, yes, thank you very much. I am Benedictine monk in a monastery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are Roman Catholic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, Roman Catholic. But I follow the eastern rite of the Greek Orthodox church. In our monastery you get the two rites, the Roman Catholic and also the customs of life... It's like the Greek Orthodox monks. We also have the rosary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes. And continue also, "Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me." Also I repeat, "Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me. Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. You know Greek language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you know the word Christo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christo means Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, Christ, Kriza (?), Kristos, who is Christ by oil. Anointed. Christos, Christ, means anointed. It's the same word. It's the same form. Christo and Kristos in Greek is the same word, anointed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I see. So this Christo is the broken version of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Ah, yes, I see. Very good, very interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because in India still, when calling for Kṛṣṇa, one says Kṛṣṭa. And Kṛṣṭa means the attractor, the Sanskrit meaning, attractor, one who draws, draws everyone nearer. That is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa. And that all-attractive drawer is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, I think so too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore God's name is Kṛṣṭa. So when Christ said that "My father, the Lord, hallowed be Thy name," that name is Kṛṣṭa or Kṛṣṇa. How do you think of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, I think that Christ, (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> He says that Jesus as the son of God has revealed the name of God, yes, and his opinion is that we call name of God... The name of God is Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The name of God is Christ. That Christ is another form of pronouncing Kṛṣṭa. And Kṛṣṭa is another form of pronouncing Kṛṣṇa. Therefore God's name is Kṛṣṇa. So Christ said to glorify the name of God, but somebody says in Christian that there is no name of God. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> We have name of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> We talk God, "Father," or "our Father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, "Father..." Just like your son may call you, "Father," but you have got a name also, "Mr. such and such." My son, your son, everyone's son calls his father, "father." But the father has a name also. Similarly, God is the general name, but still, He has got a particular name. And that name is Kṛṣṇa. And that is accepted by Jesus. Jesus the Christ or Jesus the son of Christ or Kṛṣṇa. And he identified himself as the son of God. Therefore the name of God is... Either you call Kṛṣṭa or Kṛṣṇa or Christo, it doesn't matter. The name of God is Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṭa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, when we can't speak of a name of God, of a proper name... (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> He says that when we speak of a real name of God, that is Christos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Christos means Kṛṣṇa. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Because a name is of God. We know the name of God only by revelation, by revelation of the son of God because the son of God is also God. He has the three personality: God, father, son and holy ghost. And the son has revealed the name of father, and His name is, who has revealed is Christos, Christ. And also you can as a name or all you take Christ, Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it doesn't matter, Kṛṣṇa or Christ. The name is there. And we are recommending according to Vedic scripture that in this age one should simply chant the holy name of God. We are chanting that,</div>
<div class="Verse">Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare<br class="calibre2"/>Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, they are the name of God. And Harā is the energy of God. So we are chanting Kṛṣṇa, or God, along with His energy. He has got two energies, spiritual energy and material energy. So at the present moment we are under the jurisdiction of material energy. So we are praying to Kṛṣṇa, "Kindly transfer me from the service of material energy to the service of spiritual energy." This is our whole philosophy. Hare Kṛṣṇa movement means, "O the energy of God and O God, Kṛṣṇa, please engage me in your service." Because our constitutional position is to give service. Some way or other, we have been put in the service of the material energy. So this service can be transferred to the spiritual energy. Then our life is successful. That is our philosophy, <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga, bhakti-yoga. Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Here we are giving service as Hindu, as Muslim, as Christian, as Jain, as this or that. These are designation. Designation. When we become free of the designation and then serve God, that is called <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> or devotion. Just like we have manufactured Christian religion, Hindu religion, Muslim religion, this religion, that religion. But when the religion will be without designation-I am neither Hindu nor Muslim nor Christian, but I am servitor of God-that is pure religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Pure religion, yes, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So pure religion means <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mukti,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> And <span class="Italic">mukti</span> too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means <span class="Italic">mukti</span> is included. Without <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> Therefore when one is on the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> he has already attained <span class="Italic">mukti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out. <span class="Italic">Māṁ ca avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate. Māṁ ca avyabhicāreṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation in English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him... German translation will help you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes. French, in Hindi also and English I speak, but... (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You read the purport. (Devotee reads in German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Brahman is not Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahman. Yes, He is Parabrahman. Parabrahman. Brahman is realized in three angles of vision: impersonal Brahman and localized Brahman, Paramātmā in the heart, and personal Brahman. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Brahman because ultimately God is person. Yes. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.</span> The exact Sanskrit word is <span class="Italic">vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam</span> [SB 1.2.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> The Absolute Truth is described by the person who knows the Absolute Truth in three ways: <span class="Italic">brahmeti,</span> the impersonal Brahman, <span class="Italic">paramātmeti,</span> the localized Paramātmā, and Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate feature of God, full with all six opulences, the richest, the strongest, the most famous, the most wise, the most renounced and most beautiful. These are the six features of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> That's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And His being Absolute, His name is not different from Him. The name and the form and the quality of God, they are all Absolute. Therefore chanting His name means associating with God. So when one associates with God, gradually He becomes godly. And when he is fully purified, then he becomes associate of God. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> (translating for <span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel</span>) But we can understand the name of God only in a negative way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. God has unlimited potencies, and therefore He has got unlimited names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, but we are limited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are limited, but God is not limited. Unlimited. And because He is unlimited, therefore He has got unlimited names, not one or two but unlimited names. There is a Sanskrit book, <span class="Italic">Aṣṭottara-sahasra.</span> There are 1,008 names of God. So 1,008 is also limited, but because we are limited, the God's names are given to us as far as we can understand. Otherwise He has got unlimited potencies, unlimited names. And each and every name is God because He is absolute. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Allow you a question? You know that we Christians are also preaching the love of God, and we seek to fulfill the love of God and to serve God with all our heart and soul. And what different from your movement who will the same? And why do you send your disciples in these Christian countries to preach the love of God when the gospel of Jesus Christ is also preaching the love of God, God love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you don't mind, I can say that the Christians are not obeying the orders of God. Do you agree or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is love? If you disobey the orders of God, then where is your love? Therefore we have come here to teach them to love God. If you love me, you cannot disobey me. And if you disobey me, that love is not real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Will that means that Christianity has to change their customs or the Christianity, Roman Catholic or Protestant, must return to the source?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside) You can sit on the chair if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, I like to sit, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only Christianity, everywhere, the people now do not love God, but they love dog. Yes. Therefore this movement is required, awakening of God consciousness. Not the Christians, they are only to be accused, but Hindus, Muslim, everyone. They are simply stamp, but no obedience to God. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Can you say exactly the point where Christians are not obedient. Do you see any points here by your visit to the Christian countries and you like to say for us? It is a help for us to say exactly the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The first point is that your commandment is "Thou shalt not kill," and you are maintaining regularly slaughterhouse. The first commandment is disobeyed. Do you agree or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Um...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or in my front the animals are being kept for being killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I personally agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I personally agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, actually, if Christians are lover, they must stop immediately this animal killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> And you think it's a principle point, the top point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you miss one point, if you commit mistake in calculation in one point, the more you make calculation, add and subtract, it is all mistake. (German) Just like in the bank they daily make a trial balance, and if there is one mistake anywhere, the trial balance does not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is called <span class="Italic">ardha-kukkuṭī-nyāya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi-līlā </i>5.176]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you... I will explain. <span class="Italic">Ardha-kukkuṭī-nyāya</span> means there is a logic of accepting half of the chicken. The chicken or what is called, cock, that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, the rooster, hens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hens, rooster, rooster. No, the female is called hen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hen. The hen is giving egg and, by the backside, by the rectum, and eating by the mouth. So one man is considering that "This mouthpiece is expensive because I have to give to eat. Better cut it." So if the mouth is cut, then there will be no egg because it's a dead body. So this is not good logic, (laughing) that the expensive portion may be cut and the profitable portion may be kept. This kind of interpretation will not be helpful. If you accept the whole, this side and that side, then business will go on. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> In the Christian tradition... (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The first commandment is "Thou shall not kill." But they are killing. The first point is disobedient. Then where is love of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> (German) It is in the relation of man. "Don't kill," it says, the Christianity understands...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they understand like that? That means that Lord Christ was not sufficiently educated to use the right word, "murder"? Does it mean so? There are two words, killing and murder. Murder is especially meant for the human being. So do you think that Christ was not learned enough to use the word murder instead of "killing"? "Killing" means any kind of killing, especially animal killing. Otherwise you should have frankly openly used the word, "Thou shall not murder." Even if it is meant like that, so does it mean that he was preaching amongst the murderers? They are very first-class men? They are all murderers? Therefore the injunction. This kind of interpretation does not appeal to us. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> He said, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that this commandment, "Thou shall not kill," is found in the Old Testament, and when Jesus was talking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know many testament, but I see in the Ten Commandments these words are there. If you want to support it by many testaments, that is, of course, your business, but we take the direct meaning, "Thou shall not kill"-the Christians should not kill. Interpretation you can give in your own way to support your business, but we see openly. If we can understand openly, there is no need of interpretation. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> No, I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should we interpret? Interpretation is required when the things are not clear. Here it is clear, "Thou shall not kill," plainly advised. Why should we interpret? (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> (translating for Pater Emmanuel:) To eat plants, is it not killing? To eat vegetables, is it not killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then vegetable killing and animal killing is the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> It's not the same. Not the same. But human killing and animal killing is also the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are not killing. Our Vaiṣṇava philosophy, we do not kill even vegetable because our Kṛṣṇa says... Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> Should I read this in Sanskrit, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati, tad aham aśnāmi bhakty-upahṛtam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> (reads translation in German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we offer Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants: "Give me this foodstuff," so we offer the foodstuff to Kṛṣṇa, and we take it. Therefore, if for killing this <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpam</span> there is sin, that is Kṛṣṇa's sin, not my sin. (German) But Kṛṣṇa, God, <span class="Italic">apāpa-viddham,</span> sinful reaction cannot take place to Him. <span class="Italic">Apāpa-viddham. Pāpa</span> means sinful. Just like the sun is powerful. It can absorb urine, but you cannot drink urine. (German) So the injunction is <span class="Italic">tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.33.29]. One who is very powerful... Just like a king. He orders, "Kill this man. Murder." He commits murder regularly, chopped up. But he is not under the law, being hanged, because he is very powerful. But an ordinary man, if he commits murder, he will be hanged. When there is fight the commander in chief says, "You kill them," and the soldier kills and he gets gold medal. But the same soldier, when he kills a single person at home, he is hanged. Therefore this injunction, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> "This vegetables give Me. I shall eat, and you take the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" So we are not sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> And Kṛṣṇa cannot give the same permission for the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the animal kingdom in the nature's way... Just like the grass is the food of the cow, and the cow is the food for man, but not for civilized man, religious man. The crude man. (German) [break] The perfect human being is described: <span class="Italic">śamo damas titikṣā ārjavam.</span> Find out. [break] ...killing of animals and child, Christ's name. Then it will be perfect. I have not come to teach you, but to request you that your Christian religion prohibit this and encourages chanting of name of the Lord. So you kindly do it, that's all. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. We are also chanting Christ or Kṛṣṇa, the same thing. So let us join to together and chant. If you have got objection to chant Kṛṣṇa, you chant Christ or Christo. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ.</span> He says that God has got many multi names. Any one of them you chant because each and every name has the same potency as God the person, because His name and He, there is no difference. And if we become designationless, if we give up these titles, "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Christian," and simply chant God's name, then we become on the spiritual platform immediately, without any discrimination that "Here is Hindu, here is Muslim, here is Christian, here is white, here is black," that. We are preaching that human form of life is meant for God realization or to learn how to love God. That is real business of human being. So either do it as a Christian or as a Muslim or as a Hindu, it doesn't matter. But do this business. (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are practically doing that. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa-this is our business. We always keep the chanting beads just like you are keeping. Yes. Chant, that's all. Everyone should do. Where is the harm? If everyone takes this chanting... You are Christian; you have taken. Why not other Christians? They also can take. Chant. There is no loss. By chanting, there is no loss, but there is good gain, so why should we miss this opportunity of chanting? The cats and dogs, they cannot chant. But we have got human tongue, we can chant. There is no loss, but there is great gain. Now, these young boys, they are always chanting. It is only practice. It is training. These young boys and girls, they could go and act so many things frivolously, but now they have given up everything. They don't eat meat, egg, fish, no intoxication up to drinking tea or smoking, no gambling, no illicit sex and chanting. (pause) If you can cooperate, then we go to the church and chant, "Christ, Christ, Christo, Christo, Christo, or Christo, Christo." Is there any objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we should be allowed. Instead of keeping the churches locked up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> On my part, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we are talking with you. You are a representative of Christian kind. So instead of keeping the churches locked up, why not give it us? We shall chant twenty-four hours. Actually this is fact. Many places we have purchased churches. And before our purchasing, the church was practically locked up. Nobody was going. And because nobody was going, therefore it was available for purchase. In London I have seen. Hundreds and thousands of churches are locked up, or they are being used for different purpose. There are many hundreds and thousands churches, but they are not going on. So this experience... In Los Angeles we purchased one church. So it was sold because people were not coming. Now you go to the same church, and the same men, they are coming by thousands. And one Christian preach in Boston, he issued one leaflet that "These boys are our boys. Before accepting this movement, they were never coming to the church. They never inquired about God. And now they are mad after God. How it has happened?" Yesterday the inquiry was "Why the Americans and the Germans are taking to this path?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "How come it has expanded so quickly?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> What was your answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer. What the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati (?):</span> Prabhupāda didn't understand, accepting him in German.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no. The answer I gave, you do not remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Because they are intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Any intelligent man will understand what is religion, what is God, in five minutes. It doesn't require even five hours. In five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Yes, I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we do not want to understand. That is the difficulty. Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> He believes that to understand God is not a question of intelligence but it is a question of humility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "The humble and meek shall go to the kingdom of God." Is it not? It is Bible statement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "The humble and meek shall inherit the earth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So nowadays the rascal philosophy has spread that everyone is God, and therefore nobody is humble and meek. If everyone thinks that he is God, then why he should be humble and meek? So they are being educated how to become humble and meek. In the temple, to God, or to the spiritual master, the God's representative, they offer always respect by offering obeisances. That is humble and meek. They are doing very easily progress, you see, only on account of this humbleness and meekness. Even on the road, if they see me, they immediately fall down flat. Never mind there is dust. This very qualification is pushing them towards spiritual realization. In the Vedic scripture it is said,</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya deve parā bhaktir<br class="calibre2"/>yathā deve tathā gurau<br class="calibre2"/>tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prakāśante mahātmanaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Yasya...</span> "Anyone who has got unflinching faith in God and His representative, the spiritual master, to him only, the purport of the scriptures become revealed." (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> He is asking if he should not show this humility, attitude of humility, to all others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> Exercise upon others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But just like special respect and ordinary respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> But I think it is a very necessary, this mutual respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. This is instructed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that you should offer respect even to a person who has no respect. <span class="Italic">Amāninā mānadena.</span> You should not expect any respect for yourself, but you should give respect to others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I agree with all my heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think those who are Christian priests, they should cooperate with this movement, chant the name of Christ or Christo and stop animal killing. This is according to Bible. This is not according to my philosophy, but their Christian philosophy. Simply let them do it and see how the situation becomes nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pater Emmanuel:</span> I am very thankful to you for this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (everyone goes out-end of this discussion) [Break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German devotee:</span> (devotee translates for German man) Where is it written in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that sexual intercourse is only allowed in married life? Is there any statement in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Find out, <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi. Dharmāviruddha. Dharma, d-h-a-r, dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.</span></div>
