<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Maybe they should go in the procession though. That would look impressive, wouldn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All our cars behind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We could have had our twenty-five vans and eight buses.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ādi-keśava Mahārāja, did you hear that? The three buses should go in the procession.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All cars, also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The cars. (laughs) Some of the cars don't look appropriate. Some of the cars are used cars, they do not look very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Good cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The nice-looking cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good cars. This car and the other van.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, this car will be there. So that's nice. Three buses, Ādi-keśava, will you take care of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> And the nice-looking vans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did the other two buses arrive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> I know only of the two that are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...were just amazed at the dancing of Lord Caitanya. How Lord Jagannātha would stop His car just to see. It says that Lord Jagannātha is maintaining the whole universe, so who can carry Him? Only by His sweet will for His own pastimes can He be moved. And the cart that moves Him is as tall as Mount Sumeru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Potamkin..., and what was that in Washington, Potomyer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Potomac.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And you wrote that just like the cart of Jagannātha is compared to Mount Sumeru, similarly, in London they were comparing it to that statue of Lord Nelson.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lord Nelson's column.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Lord Nelson's column.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has become against.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is political.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe because of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only politics. So mean-minded, they have no idea even beyond politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Where are the <span class="Italic">rathas</span> now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They're starting to pull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Dhṛṣṭadyumna Mahārāja...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's one of them.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, the tops are down though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For the wires. They have to be down to move them. Sixty men are already engaged in pulling the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> carts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Since five this morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sixty men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where are you going, Ādi-keśava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Well, they're pulling the cart up. Can't really go right down next to them. It's a very steep incline.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ādi-keśava, can you just go and let us see the carts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, just drive right up to it, they should wait.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can wait for a minute. It's not budging, so there's no loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, they announced that this cart was not moving, and they needed fifteen more men. They announced that in the temple room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Go down there, Ādi-keśava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More fifteen men required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very big. Others have been moved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, all three are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They weigh fourteen thousand pounds each.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do you like them, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, they are nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Strong? Strong enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now it's going to move because you're here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, they have mirrors on the wheels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Now they are moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Uh-oḥ, it's caught in the wire up there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's..., in Philadelphia it was constantly catching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are mirrors all over the wheels, Rāmeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where are the <span class="Italic">cāmaras</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They have the <span class="Italic">cāmaras.</span> They'll be put on afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is this the small one or the medium size?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> This is the big one. (devotees shouting "Prabhupāda! Balarāma!")</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> By chanting your name they are getting so much strength.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They are chanting "Prabhupāda, Balarāma."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the best combination. There's Jayānanda leading the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, the wheels are very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really. Jayānanda has made good for all the other wheels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> This is the cart you will ride, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is Lady Subhadrā's cart from Chicago. We borrowed it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> It's our cart now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Could have been painted, the wheels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thick coat of lacquer or varnish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the wheels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, right on the wood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the only place that was varnished in Philadelphia? The rest is painted, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I believe so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Simply by your presence, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the carts will move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Those look like good ropes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> He said they are made out of some nylon, very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Lord Jagannātha was carried by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wheels are all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow, they are painted nicely. It's going to be a very attractive ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So all the cars should go also, behind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have some..., I think we have a lot of good vans here, Rāmeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We can arrange for it at <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That's the time when everyone should be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Very nicely made, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you for your blessings, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Look at those spires! Prabhupāda, do you see that spire? There's a spire at the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Right at the top, right under the canopy on that cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's going to be placed on top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And that must be a flag on top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Golden colored?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Like gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Huge spire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very heavy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The spire? No, it's made of foam, that, styrofoam. It couldn't weigh more than five, ten pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But it looks very,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It looks very heavy though. That's a good idea, because it won't weigh the canopies down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's a very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Carve it out of styrofoam. It's a big festival. The first year three chariots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Whew! They're going to simply be astonished when the public sees this. The newspapers, they will just be..., they've never seen anything like it. They cannot imagine it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How big are those wheels, Rāmeśvara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, they must be at least eight feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Seven and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Seven and a half feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's the park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nicely made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda! <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayānanda looks exhausted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's worked so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Staying up all nights, working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> For five days he hasn't gone to sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Five days and nights he's worked continuously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...this city, this will be a small parade with some hand-pulled floats. Another trick of the Hare Kṛṣṇas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bali Mahārāja was asked for three feet of land. "Very good. You speak so nicely, such intelligent, but You are boy, You do not know how to ask. I can give You a big island." "No, I must be satisfied as I require. I don't want more. Only three feet, that's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That story is in the Eighth Canto, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. I'm going now with that story. [break] "Rascal, if you give like that, where you will stay? He'll take everything!" <span class="Italic">Smārta brāhmaṇa.</span> Simply considering "How I shall live?" (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Materialist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did Bali Mahārāja reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He rejected guru. "You are not guru."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śukrācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But that guru told him to worship Viṣṇu officially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he was by nature Viṣṇu, Vaiṣṇava, like the grandfather, Prahlāda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But he was a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Born as a demon, in a demon family, not a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demon family. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-dveṣī(</span>?). Still, they are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> Just like the Europeans and Americans, they were <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> now they have become demons. Actually they are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> I have studied. And the Jews are <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Jews are <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why they call them the American Marwaris<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. They know how to do business and earn money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A lot of your disciples are Jewish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore they know how to make money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They take up your idea of book distribution and they make all the money from it. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything can be utilized for Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vacaḥ.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sky is very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, good morning. When the sky is clear the Englishmen call "good morning." This is the origin of "good morning." Because unfortunately, in their country the sky is never clear. If by chance some day it is clear, they say "Oh, it is a good morning." That is the origin of that. One Englishman told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now they always greet each other by saying "Good morning, sir."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it has become now a phrase, but originally the word originated when the morning was good, because that is a great fortune for them. (laughter) Yes, in London I was three months; always gloomy, damp, cloudy. Therefore I, television said, they asked, "What is your idea of hell?" and "This is hell, London. London is hell." He stopped. He did not ask anything more. This is hell. Simply by big, big buildings, you are keeping as heaven, but it is the hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The British propagated in India though that everything was like milk and honey...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...in Britain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They propagated the Thames River as very big river. And when I first saw it, it is canal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Canal. And the Ganges they said was nasty. Thames was a river and the Ganges was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jamesford, Lord James. That Jamesford is a village only. Some big man, little, take the title lord and go and become governor there. And when some Indian comes they say that Lord Jamesford was traveling in third-class compartment in railway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These buildings are not actually made of this stone. They are made of brick, covered by stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are very nicely made. It is not possible now to construct such nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kīrtanānanda is constructing like this, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Museum of Natural History. Actually, it is made of stone. The museums are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government building, they can stand at the cost of taxpayer. [break] West Central Park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Central Park West, it's called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That portion there, Śrīla Prabhupāda, through the trees there is a green dome-I don't know if it can be seen now-that is the Planetarium of the Museum of Natural History. All atheistic arguments are presented there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All their arguments that life comes from matter, that the universe has no life, or at least that there are just all chemical reactions are the cause of creation of stars; that there are many suns. All these arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have in that museum many scales, and you can go on the scales and weigh yourself as you would weigh on different planets. I remember when I was a child I used to go on one scale after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They speculate that if you were on the moon planet, say you weigh one hundred fifty pounds on earth, if you were on the moon planet you would weigh much less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twenty-five pounds, one-sixth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And you would be able to be so light that you could jump very high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Almost floating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they have understood these things? From here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> From here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First thing is that it is full of life. Full of very, very intelligent demigods. They have never gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If a devotee were to go to the moon, would he see all of these very intelligent demigods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyone would see them. (laughs) But nobody's gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, he would see the cities also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if someone actually went there, they would see all this life. It's not that you have to have a special vision to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have to qualify yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To get there. But once getting there, I mean it's plainly visible to the eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda gave the example that Arjuna, he was qualified, so that he went to Indraloka planet one time, and he saw with his eyes the cities, the palace of Indra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he was tempted. Arjuna was tempted when he went to Indraloka. But he closed his eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, descriptions are there of Indraloka. The pavements with pearls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is described, in the eighth chapter you'll find, er, Eighth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the Seventh Canto they described the palace of Indra, because Hiraṇyakaśipu had lived there. How he was living there, and the walls of his palace are studded with jewels. There's a nice description. What to speak of an ocean of milk, there's so many things they cannot imagine. [break] (walking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The buses, you know the windows, some of the windows are broken a little bit-you saw them. Do you think they will look good in the parade? It's all right if the windows are not all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is going to see? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Great American paintings. What they consider to be great American paintings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's an art exhibition. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In London they have got such a nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You think one day, Prabhupāda, maybe these big buildings will be our temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No, our executive office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rāmeśvara will have his office here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Look how interested they are in China. They have a collection of Chinese paintings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not our paintings? [break] ...were constructed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think around the turn of the century, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Most of the big buildings like this here were constructed at that time. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...prohibited?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In the park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is written there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because they don't want the park full of drunks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The children, they don't want them soliciting children or the children to drink anything. It's to protect the children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They know it is bad, but they say that everyone has to make his own choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They know it is bad, but they like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Will these parents like that the children may have liberty to follow a dark path? Will the father like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why the government doesn't...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're making too much revenue to stop selling it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not good government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The parents are bad also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They put an age limit on it. They say you can only buy liquor when you have reached a certain age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They want the children to be good, but the parents are bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They want the children to be good, but the parents are all bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think you have to be eighteen years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you become bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Before you become bad. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good philosophy. Eighteen years, you become bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> All their culture of goodness is wasted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Also there are these nightclubs, you have to be a certain age before you can go in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Afro-American Art." What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I think it means art by American black persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Afro-American means people with dark-skinned bodies, they have painted these paintings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One of the big problems that you read about a lot now is how parents are confused about how to educate their children, because there are so many different standards, and they don't know how their children will turn out anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is our standard-to make him devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These are Chinese art paintings. They are having a special exhibit of Chinese art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Afro-American, why not Indo-American?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There is an Indian exhibition at a different museum right now. This museum also has Indian exhibitions sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> One of the biggest art professors in this country saw our books recently, and he said he's very interested in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that he thinks it's a new kind of art that your devotees are painting. That's also a school of art, and more and more it will be recognized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Right now they have one big exhibit of photographs that the British took when they first came to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's at the Asia House Gallery nearby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> We have professors who buy the complete standing order series of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>-it's because they like the artwork. And then they read the philosophy and like that too. But the art attracts them many times first. They very much like the purports of your writings, that it gives a living expression of the peoples of India other than just historical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They purchase books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Yes. They like it because it's not dry, like many of the other books-the art and the very glorious philosophical presentation. Your works are more enlivening and more easy for the students to understand, especially undergraduate students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They appreciate that your books have got life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think we could have some of these up along in front of our building, advertising things within our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These glass display cases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These glass display cases, if we have these outside the front of our building, people will come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's how they attract people. [break] They are always trying to think how to paint the bodies to look transcendental or spiritual. So this art historian has said this is a new style of art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's telling me that when he sells the books... (end)</div>
