<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. What he will do, more payment? (?) Then he will kill. This sex life in this material world is so strong, even in the heavenly planets. Big, big <span class="Italic">ṛṣis.</span> Sex life with animals also there is... Sex life is so strong. Man cohabiting with animal. It makes blind. Vyāsadeva made one of her (his) students pregnant, what to speak of ourselves. Vyāsadeva was born, Satyavatī. She was low class. Although she was born by a king, but her mother was a low-class fisherwoman. And the fisherman raised her as daughter. And Parāśara Muni became attracted. And Vyāsadeva was born. Sex affairs, just see, in the highest circle. Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the <span class="Italic">devatās,</span> he became so much mad for his brother's wife who was pregnant, and forcibly they had sex. Just see. These are examples. Brahmā became attracted with his daughter. Lord Śiva became attracted with the beauty of Mohinī-mūrti, even in the presence of his wife. So this sex life can be controlled only by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise there is no... The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> has discussed all this because in this material world there is no escape unless we become Kṛṣṇa conscious, from the sex impulse. It is not possible. <span class="Italic">Yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa...</span> When one is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he'll reject all this nonsense: "What is this?" <span class="Italic">Bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu.</span> He'll spite (spit): "Eh! Get out. Is that enjoyment?" It is possible for a Kṛṣṇa conscious... No other can do it. And that is the bondage. He'll have to work hard for maintaining sex issues. And so long you are bound up by the <span class="Italic">karmas,</span> you have to accept another body and then continue. Who knows this how we are bound up and conditioned? If you talk in the modern society they will laugh: "What nonsense this man is... 'By sex life one becomes conditioned.' " They cannot understand. Hare Kṛṣṇa... (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) This should be strictly outlawed, no more <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> And those <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> who have fallen, you get them married, live like a... No more this showbottle, cheating. It is very ludicrous. Even there is a promise that "We shall not fall down again," that is also not believable. What is the use? Better go and speak philosophy in your <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> dress, not this dress, but you have nice coat, pants, gentleman. Who says no? I never said. Rather I shall be glad to see that up-to-date gentlemen with <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> are speaking. That is very prestigious everywhere. Why this false dress? What is the wrong to become <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span>? I was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha, pākā</span> caliber <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> My Guru Mahārāja was <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> This is ever... Just see his character. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> but when He took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa:</span> "Oh, I am now..." For sober person. That is wanted. That is ideal. He married twice. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura married twice. Caitanya Mahāprabhu married twice. What is the wrong there? One has to become pure devotee, that's all. Other things, of course, are circumstantially favorable, either a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> or <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsa. Kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya, yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei 'guru' haya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> You must know the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That makes you guru, not this dress. So what you are thinking of American program? Do it seriously. Balavanta is very expert. And all of you are expert. And do it seriously and systematically, not change the position, this side and this, change. That's not good. That makes fickle. Strength of mind wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Prabhupāda, I was thinking of taking books, going from town to town, and finding interested people and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will be interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. And stay for some time in one place, find some local people, train them up cooking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, that is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...<span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> speaking, reading the books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...and let them set up a small center in their house or purchase one storefront.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one is convinced about this favorably, that is success. It doesn't matter what dress. Let him teach his family, and the neighborhood. Let them do their own business. It doesn't matter. That is... Let them understand Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa science. That is wanted. Do that program. Make that program. He is coming, Rāmeśvara. Take to it very seriously. [break] I can cycle even now. In our childhood... I had car, but my nephew was driving. I never drove. In 1925, I purchased one Buick car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Buick? It's a good car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time in India it was eight thousand rupees only, very strong car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> From America it came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, American cars were selling during British days, Ford, Buick, Chevrolet. These cars were selling. Dodge. In 1925 I purchased one Buick car, eight thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Small cars were everywhere 1700 rupees in 1936-37.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Ford car was very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Thirty-two hundred rupees. V8 Ford cars were sold in Bombay market for thirty-two hundred rupees, three thousand two hundred. Now you send a car for repairs, the bill will be six thousand, seven thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done? Things have gone high, I was calculating the other day, twenty times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Thirty times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> More than that. Thirty times, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty times, yes. My father's income was from 250 to 300, and we were living very comfortably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> A month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was more than sufficient, those days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that three hundred rupees means... What you calculated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, at 250 rupees it came to seven and a half thousand rupees now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. Even low as 250 it comes to seven thousand rupees. So who has got seven thousand rupee income now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In my house we spend monthly more than six thousand rupees. I studied for my graduation in the college at fifty rupees a term fee for six months. I'm paying for those small kids going to the family schools seven hundred rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our family was taking two kilos and a half milk daily. Two <span class="Italic">annas</span> per kilo. Ghee was selling, first-class ghee, in Calcutta... Just in front of our house there was a grocer shop. We were purchasing in that tin, but if some required, I would go immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Fourteen rupees I think it was. Fourteen rupees is twenty kilos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Less than that. Ten <span class="Italic">seers.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is twenty kilos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Cow ghee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, buffalo's... Cow ghee we were taking with rice. But it was not available in quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Many was so very cheap then. After I graduated myself when I was university scholar, I was given seventy-five rupee scholarship per month and a free bungalow with servants and all these things. It was all right for me till I passed my M.D., seventy-five rupees only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This cow's milk in Bengal, it is compulsory-before beginning your meal, little cow milk, er, ghee mixed with rice and smashed potato. It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then we do serve..., after that we take out a part of it for the cow back, and a little for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ālu bharte bharta.</span> (?) In Bengal it is called <span class="Italic">ālu bharte bharta.</span> If you don't have anything, just have smashed potato, little ghee and rice. That's it. It is sufficient, very nutritious. And at last, little milk. Very nutritious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now there is shortage of all the important material the world over. The way we are exploiting the earth, perhaps we'll be short, falling short of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore our Trivikrama Mahārāja is reminding me... When I was lecturing in Berkeley University, one Indian student asked me, "Swamijī, what this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement will benefit? We require technology." So I replied that "You have come to beg technology; I have come to give them, not to beg from them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> To teach. "I've come to give."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I understand. The modern materialistic, I mean, advancement of society with this modern technology will, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even from that point of view, I was taking aeroplane. Aeroplane was flying. So we admit this is contribution of the Western technology. But it is not safe. But what I am giving, it is safe. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato...</span> So our, this contribution of India's culture and this contribution, far different. That is not safe. At any moment you'll be finished. But here-<span class="Italic">svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt. Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> This Manipur state is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> And these people say that three thousand years before, there was no civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Now they're changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In Manipur where Arjuna made...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Babhruvāhana. And Babhruvāhana was the king's daughter's son, so he remained as the adopted son of the king. <span class="Italic">Putrikā-suta.</span> He had no son so he took the daughter's son. So this is India's... The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they're not (indistinct), and some <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are ruling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are ruling the world over, not only in India. Because Nixon was less than a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> they way he carried out himself, the highest authority of the most advanced state materialistically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are going to take care of it, these <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he made a very bad show. The place where a man like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Washington and people like Jefferson. He has polluted that seat. They must change that seat. Change the White House wholesale. The greatest curr on this most, I mean, enlightened people. Americans are very enlightened because their forefathers were enlightened and they came there as pilgrims. Those, what do they call them? Puritans, you see. They are most different from Aussies. The Australians who are criminals of England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If Nixon is a Jew?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. He's a Christian. No Jew can be, serve as the president of that country. Not only Jew but not only Catholic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Well, some Catholics. Kennedy was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Only Kennedy was the first Catholic to be. Otherwise till Kennedy came, there was no Catholic ever elected. [break] Methodist. Even in material world, he was a fool the way he carried out... (laughing) But sir, one thing: about the freedom of America. I have my hat off that that man could be knocked off by ordinary paper reporter. That would not happen in any other country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I asked to take the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That would not happen in any other country but America, freedom par excellence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is possibility of Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees will take the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That can be possible because of freedom, essential freedom of that country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we are being checked that "They may not grow." One politician has said that "If they grow like this, in ten years they'll take the government."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Someone has said that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. He said. Some politician has said that "The Hare Kṛṣṇa people are growing so rapid, like epidemic." He has said. "And if they grow like this within ten years they may take our government." He has remarked it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Good for them. The amount of money that has been wasted by America, that much money could have raised the standard of living the whole...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money is no consideration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Apart from that, sir, after all, it is a disease, poverty. If the people are out of poverty, then they will think about... First they'll think about God in the stomach. Then anywhere else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Out of poverty, then they'll think about wine and women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that is in America, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have nothing to eat. You have seen the people living worse than the pigs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> We have seen in Japan. Now they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Here also, all these politicians, they are after woman, meat and money. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One... Who was speaking, that in...? Some gentleman, he was Feroz(?) Gandhi's friend. He went to America, and he was eating beef like anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Feroz? He was, Gandhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not... No, another Indian leader. He's a Marwari <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Parsee would never eat beef, sir, huh? I heard they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They are eating everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They don't eat beef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know. They are eating. They eat everything. I have seen one Parsee here in Bombay. He is chanting and getting one chicken cut throat by the man. And he's cutting. He gave in a paper and he took it away. And he's chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> (Dr. Patel laughs loudly) Not Hare Kṛṣṇa, but... They have got all their chants. They have got their chanting. And I have seen their kitchen. It is more dirty than the toilet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Filthiest thing. Most dirty kitchens are the Muslims, very horrible thing. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...day one Hindi gentleman came. He presented a picture, India's map, and all the whole India is full of <span class="Italic">avatāras:</span> Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, this, that. This is India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They might be <span class="Italic">vibhūtis.</span> You can call them, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, same thing. What <span class="Italic">vibhūtis</span> they have got? <span class="Italic">Vibhūti</span> of cheating, that's all. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are <span class="Italic">vibhūti</span> anyhow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got some <span class="Italic">vibhūti,</span> how to cheat. This <span class="Italic">vibhūti</span> they have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> He was serious? He was serious about the map?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He came to me to support this movement. What is this nonsense map, all cheaters pictured here? All Bhagavān, so many thousands of Bhagavāns. <span class="Italic">Vibhūti</span> of cheating, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yad yad vibhūtimat sattvam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">vibhūti</span> you have got also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Whatever it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Even an ant has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that means if you... A bigger ant. There are in South America are some ants, you know, big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is... That... That gift is given by God to everyone. That does not mean one is Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the cheating of cheats."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The greatest number, sir, is being carried out here in Bombay some fifty miles away by this Muktananda Swami. His statue is being worship as, in place of God by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sai Baba is also. Sai Baba is also doing, Satya Sai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say that they are worshiping the guru as God. And why not as their guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rajaneesh. Rajneesh</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Rajneesh calls himself Bhagavān, that man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He also says, "Bhagavān."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's doing a sort of mass hypnotism to my mind. Psychologically I try to analyze him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without analyzing, we take him as rogue. (laughter) That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You... I, being a scientist, try to analyze. This is my nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Analysis is our nature, he said.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> What is that process, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The process: if one is not <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakta,</span> he's a rogue.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> About this guru, they have taken it in a very wrong way. <span class="Italic">Ādya-guru</span> is Kṛṣṇa. That way you must go and worship that way.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have. And I found that only <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the real way. And to correct myself I read out all the Vaiṣṇava literature. I know this Sanskrit. And then I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside) That's nice.(?) But first give me little cow's milk-cup-and put little flat rice, not too much, and little fruit. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So, sir, you are going by train to Kumbhamela.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I like train.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I would have accompanied you if you had gone by plane. I would lose lot of time going and coming. While coming back, you will come out to ten days, five days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Train, first-class is very comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But you see, after all, it takes upon the health, twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Rather, doctor, your doc..., civil ser..., man, he said that, "Avoid plane." For me he had said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes, because the atmosphere changes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It will be very, very cold. It will be very, very... You have to live in a tent... After all, tent is not really... Especially in March, January, cold is extreme. It is as cold as New York but more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got many invitations from friends. I can live in the home, house. That depends on my... Either in the tent or a mile, two miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When you go out after leaving some friend's house, it will be very difficult to come out because of the cold. It will be as big as Bombay practically, this Kumbhamela, at least twenty-five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> or thirty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> It will be as big as cold. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, space is also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I'll tell one of the friends to get me some water on that day. I'll take bath here. (laughs) I had gone to Allahabad once only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have not had the chance to go there. Delhi also. I've never gone to the Delhi also. Therefore it was calling me. I have seen Delhi in 1939. After that, I have never gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My family life was in Allahabad, 1923 to 1936 continually. I used to come to Bombay from Allahabad for business. And I was staying in that hotel, Empire Hindu Hotel. Yes, very nice. At that time it was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the hotel where Lokamane(?) Tilak died. He was staying there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is modern standard, very nice hotel, still good hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Maharastrian <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> keep very good hotel, still good hotel. They are not as greedy as the Gujaratis. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are following principle. Now the Gujarati are also... And Maharastra, as good. This material civilization, meat-eating, has spread like anything. Here we see, signboard: "Beefshop." We have seen.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I thought he killed bulls.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bulls I included in cows. In place they will kill the buffaloes. The buffaloes are tamed. I don't know how in the world, sir, nowhere these buffaloes are tamed as it is in India. That means what height of these things Indian people must have reached to tame the wild animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, buffaloes are killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. What I mean to say, how buffaloes were tamed and milked and all these things, nowhere in the world other than India you'll see buffaloes, anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In China they have got? They have also? They have got, Arabian... In Africa, oh, you see a buffalo and bison... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buffalo and bison different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they are of the same degree or more wild. These are tame. This, sir, is a (Hindi). We call it (Hindi), the Sanskrit word, more or less. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The coconut trees makes the place paradise, palm trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I've got the place, sir. When you came to my house my wife immediately planted twenty-two coconuts all round. Now we get coconut, they'd be more than two thousand rupees per year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are getting eight thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, you are very good. Mine is hardly half an acre.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The other day Girirāja told me we have got eight thousand.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But these coconuts, there would be more coconuts if they are looked after, all these, putting fertilizer on and watering them. All these houses behind here, they should be very planned out. This is all filthy. Behind it is very filthy. All these tenants will be segregated on one side, this side. And those living, they will be taking possession and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, instead of taking one building, we are in possession of the all the buildings. Then that is my policy, that we must remain on the head of every building. Therefore I constructed. They cannot say absolutely it is tenant, no. Mixed. We are therefore occupying the head of every building, fixed building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There are some grand courts again (?) behind...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is one story. Otherwise we are on the head. They cannot monopolize the whole building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have a room in that building, anyway, in that one-story building we're storing our books in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have taken now, that portion. We have paid for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This place, that is the worth of that, this amount, was originally bought by Mr. Nyer, for this place, for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two rupees, three rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That one which you bought. This, this, behind, where you call. Nine annas. Nine annas a square yard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nine annas. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So my place, I bought in 1958 for fifteen rupees. Today it would take me four hundred, five hundred rupees a square yard, only within these two, three years, twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mr. Nair told me that "I have purchased not more than twenty rupees per square yard. So I shall charge you seventy rupees. It is my profit."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Seventy rupees also you were wise as compared to the modern, present prices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at that time it was selling 150. And now it is more than four hundred. Our land is, only one <span class="Italic">crore,</span> apart from these buildings. Therefore everyone is envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Most envious men are... That fellow was himself burned by pouring kerosene on. He was a most envious fellow. He even once told me, "Why do you go there?"</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Marriages are brought in famine (?) and they are never broken down again.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, but here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Marriage is, therefore, what is called primitive. Primitive. Modern marriage is primitive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think also that is correct. In your time, sir, you never used to see the girl from the year before the marriage. In our times, we never used to see the girl before the marriage. I never saw my wife. She was in Mahatma Gandhi's <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> and I was on this side. I never saw. And we lived very happily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in my marriage, it was already settled. So one day I was going in cycle. So my father-in-law forcibly took me. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So those marriage, sir, sometimes they never forget.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. My wife was eleven years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> My wife was sixteen years when I married her. I was nineteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Eleven years!</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That was nothing! They would marry at the age of five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My mother-in-law was married at seven years. And my father-in-law was eleven years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A friend of mine was telling together in the high school, and he married when he was a boy of eleven years a girl of nine. And he was sleeping when he was...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think Nehru married at the age of eighteen years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was up-to-date, English-returned. He was Gandhi's student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These boys make love and marry. And we marry and make love. (laughs) This is the background of Indian womanhood, this religion. That keeps up the sacredness of the Hindu marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everywhere there is religion, in Europe, America. Church. Church. Marriage was taken in church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Catholic marriages are indissolvable. They can't remarry. Now they have done it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That one thing is that this sort of publicity and this, this dress, is very nice. Girls who have no husband, they should dress like this, not attractive dress. A dress sometimes attracts the opposite sex. And women are... By nature they dress very nicely. (laughs) That is everywhere-to attract. The nature is that they are dependent, woman by nature. Do you admit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the Western countries, they have been taught to become independent. That is artificial. That is all artificial. So, woman by nature... <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> says, <span class="Italic">na striyaṁ svatantram arhati:</span> "Women should not be given independence." They must be protected by the father, by husband, and by elderly sons. They are not independent. No independence. Even Kuntī, the mother of such big, big sons, she was not independent. The sons were sent to the exile; mother also went. Sītā... The father-in-law never said that "You also go with your husband." No. He requested Rāmacandra that "Your stepmother wants that You should be exiled. So please accept it. Accept this." And Rāmacandra said that "You are not exiled." But Sītā said, "I may not be exiled, but I am dependent on You. If You go to the forest I must..." You see? Just see, dependent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Most of the women, or at least many of the women in our society, have neither father, husband or sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very precarious condition. So we want to give them, all of them, "Come and live." But when you come here, if you get husband we have no objection. But don't canvass. That is not good. And that is making our <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> fall down. Of course, it is difficult, that young men, young women living, intermingling. But it is... Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to reform everything. Even there there is such desire it should be checked. And that can be checked if one is strictly Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise not possible. So these things should be... Because the Kali-yuga, the more it advances, people will be suffering in so many ways. And the only solace is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, only solution. If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he (she) doesn't require husband. He (she) does not require. He... She knows that "Kṛṣṇa is my protector. Why shall I artificially seek after father or...?" And what protection, for a few days either the father or the son or the husband may give? Real protection is Kṛṣṇa. This is temporary, but because we have got this material body we require some. In this way... And this kind of hypocrisy-they have taken <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and mixing with woman. This is not to be allowed. If you want woman you get yourself married, live respectfully. We have no objection. But this hypocrisy should be stopped. There have been so many fallen down. First of all there will be no <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> anymore. I have got very bad experience. And at least, we are not going to create new <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> And those who have fallen down, let them marry, live like respectable gentlemen. I have no objection. After all, young man, fallen down-that's all right. It is by nature's way. But marry that girl. That I am insisting from the very beginning, that no friendly liaison. If you want, get one nice... They are, all of them qualified. Get one wife and live like a gentleman. Similarly woman. Live with one husband fastidiously, with children. What is the wrong there? We have so many <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotees. You have got children. Pradyumna has got child. Gopāla has... Live with husband, wife. There is no restriction for husband and wife. But what is this nonsense that you take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and make relation with...? This should be completely stopped. And in our, this campus, actually those who are eager to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they should live, nobody else. We give free food, free apartment, cloth and everything. "Come here. Live. As far as possible we shall provide." But this is specially meant for <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhajana</span>. Attend <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> early rise in the morning, attend the functions, take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>... In this way everything will be reorganized, not loose things. Then what is the use of...? We have got such a... And so far the tenants are concerned, if it is possible, give them money; let them go. One, two, some have gone, and others... This whole campus should be for devotees. We don't want tenant. And it should be developed for that purpose, for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Either here or outside India or anywhere, this principle should be followed. And this hodgepodge association, society, is not the... Let it be very pure. <span class="Italic">Ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca tārā</span>. That one moon is sufficient. There is no need of millions of stars. Hm? What do you think? One moon gives light. So, in this way, if we can make one person really Kṛṣṇa conscious, then our mission is successful. What is the use of millions of stars twinkling? What is called? Twinkling? You should discuss all these things, but you... These two brothers should be, P. Bannerji and M. Bannerji... The address is there.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda;:</span> Yes. Just like this finger is the part and parcel of my body. So this finger, I say, "Finger come here. Itch here," so it is doing that. And if it is... If it cannot do, then it is diseased. If there is some painless, painfulness or some sore, then immediately I cannot do it. So that means I am part and parcel of God. If I cannot serve God, then I am diseased. That is material condition. So material condition... Suppose this finger is diseased. So you poke up, applying some ointment and going to the doctor. This is one business. And when it is cured, when it is actually engaged in service, that is healthy state. So this social work without serving God is just like applying ointment to the diseased part of the... It has no value, practical value. If it... It has got value, provided it is cured, to serve the whole body. So if the finger is not so cured to serve the whole body, then it remains diseased. You go on applying ointment; it has no use. Similarly, to serve humanity means if you can raise him to the consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then, then, then it is right. And if you keep him in ignorance-you go on all kinds of human service-it is all useless. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>notpādayed yadi ratiṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śrama eva hi kevalam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> If by serving humanity, you cannot raise him to the standard of understanding he's part and parcel of God and his main business to serve Kṛṣṇa, then it is useless. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span>. So our service to the humanity should be... He is in forgetfulness. He does not know what is his position. If you can raise him to the position that he is part and parcel of God... Unless he comes to the position of serving God, his material condition will continue. <span class="Italic">Mām aprāpya nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.</span> So, <span class="Italic">dharmasyāsya janma, parantapa. Aśraddadhānāḥ</span>... Like that. Then that service is useless. If he continues, <span class="Italic">punar api janma, punar,</span> then his service to the humanity useless. Therefore our service to the humanity should be aimed how to awaken his original consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is real service. (pause-someone says something-Hindi) It is... There is no benefit. Simply labor of love. That's all. And just like to make one Hindu from Christian. So what benefit you'll get? He is under wrong impression that "I am Christian," and he's brought into another wrong impression-"I am Hindu." But he's neither Hindu nor Christian. He's servant of God. So to turn the Christian, to bring him to become a Hindu, it is useless labor. What benefit? A dog is also thinking, "I am dog." And if somebody is thinking, "I am Hindu," so where is the difference? <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]. If one thinks, "This body, I am"-either Hindu or Muslim or dog or cat, if one is thinking in that way, that "I am this body,"-<span class="Italic">sa eva go-kharaḥ: [SB </span>10.84.13] he's animal. So from one animal to another animal-from cat to dog or from dog to cat-where is the benefit? The position is the same. As a cat he will that "<span class="Italic">Meow,</span>" and as a dog, he'll "<span class="Italic">Gowl.</span>" That's all, that much difference. But he remains animal. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is benefit of such humanitarian work? And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says <span class="Italic">mām upetya kaunteya punar janma na vidyate</span>. No more either cat or dog. <span class="Italic">Mām eva. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Punar janma</span> means if I am cat, I become a dog, or if I am a dog, I become cat. That is <span class="Italic">punar janma.</span> So that will continue his birth and death. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is that benefit? Suppose I am now human being and next life I become either dog or a demigod. So the <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9]</span> is there, either you become a demigod or a dog. But your position is <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to come to that position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> That is the philosophical and spiritual position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real position. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you are under the law of birth and death, then it is useless, the same thing, either you become cat or dog or god or anything. <span class="Italic">Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna [Bg. </span>8.16]. So even if you take your birth in the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, still, the birth, death, old age is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokam</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Martya-lokaṁ viśanti.</span> So disease continues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> It is a circle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> And that man himself accepts all these things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> ...through his <span class="Italic">karma</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that they are <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are working to go to the heavenly planet. And what he'll do? What he will benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Ārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha</span>. In <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> people there are one..., it is very difficult to find a <span class="Italic">jñānī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">jñānī</span>... One can become <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> in a moment, provided he wants. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]. So <span class="Italic">jñānavān māṁ prapadyate</span>. So if one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, he's <span class="Italic">jñānavān</span>. Otherwise he's a rascal. So if you don't teach how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then he remains a rascal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> It is our duty to teach, to educate the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is education, that "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." Otherwise he's not education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> To guide them how to surrender the Almighty. That is our duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not know what is Almighty. And Almighty is canvassing, and people are refusing. Almighty says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]. So here is Almighty, but who is teaching that "Here is Almighty. Surrender to Him"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> That is <span class="Italic">asuri sampatti</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> Due to <span class="Italic">asuri sampatti,</span> people refuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Refusal or not, (?) people do not teach also, that "Here is Kṛṣṇa, the Almighty, the Supreme. You surrender here." And the Almighty is canvassing, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.</span> But they'll not do that. And neither their so-called leaders will teach them to do that. So this is going on. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "You become a guru." <span class="Italic">Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa</span> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> "You become a guru and deliver them." So "I am a fool. I have no education. How can I become a guru?" So answer is "No, no. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span>" If you simply advise people what Kṛṣṇa has said, then you become guru. But if you manufacture your ideas, then you are not a guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> He has to teach what is the message of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the message, "Surrender unto Me." The message... God is canvassing, that "Surrender unto Me." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "Give up all this nonsense engagement. Surrender unto Me." But they are not doing that. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ na māṁ prapadyante.</span> They're forgetting the real business, and they are engaged in some superfluous nonsense business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> Succumb to some passions and all this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> That is by ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we are preaching the Kṛṣṇa's words only, and we have become successful all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> Yes, all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they go, the so-called yogis, swamis go. They, it enters into this ear, goes out this ear. That's all. No effect. "<span class="Italic">Bag bhak.</span>"(?) (Hindi) ...effective. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> (Hindi) "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> It's a wonderful thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "And you just surrender unto Him." And anyone who is doing, he's getting the perfect wisdom.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are selling these books, daily five to six <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> daily. What is the message? "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." That's all. In one week, how many books you have sold?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where we are selling? Where Christians are there.
