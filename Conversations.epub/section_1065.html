<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...devotion, activities. Who can take more care than the father and the mother? So you combine together, make a batch of good character, ideal character in the whole world. There is no ideal character. Everyone is drunkard and meat-eater or woman-hunter. What is the civilization? Hog civilization. [break] ...civilization. Work hard, get some money, and spend it for intoxication, illicit sex. This is civilization. Is it not? They have no idea how to make civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I was hearing that before I left England there was some trouble in Scotland over the rules about the bars and drinking. And now they want to make a rule, a law, that the children can be allowed into the bars under their parents... They make it a big social...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They allow the children sit down. They take soda water and the father-mother drinking. I have seen it. They are learning from the father and mother from the begin...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> My father used to... Every Sunday they used to go to the pub, and then for Sunday afternoon, as a special treat, they would all get..., we'd be given a glass of beer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Father-mother take... Because they think it is civilization. Elderly boys, the father mother tell, "What is the wrong, illicit sex? Take woman, take car. Enjoy life." I have seen it. They know, "This is life. Why...?" Therefore they say, "Brainwash. This Swamiji is controlling their minds and brainwashing." That is their charge. Wash, <span class="Italic">ne.</span> The brain should be operated, surgical to take out all rubbish things from the... It is called membrane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Cerebrum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cereb?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Cerebral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cere... Not... It is all <span class="Italic">gobar.</span> Take out. (pause) <span class="Italic">Ne,</span> make <span class="Italic">khicuḍi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Puṣpānna</span> rice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Little, little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Always keep it simple, <span class="Italic">puris,</span> one, and one other thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, one kind. Either <span class="Italic">puri</span> or <span class="Italic">puṣpānna</span> or <span class="Italic">khicuḍi,</span> like that. You cannot make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tonight I made <span class="Italic">sabji</span> and <span class="Italic">puri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is easiest, <span class="Italic">puri</span> and <span class="Italic">sabji.</span> Similarly, <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> and <span class="Italic">sabji, puṣpānna</span> and chutney, like that. Temple means feeding them with <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> In Bombay the Sunday feast going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> We don't have so much facility to feed them because there's only the temple floor so there's always a big crowd and we have to do two shifts. So sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When it will be complete, more facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Oh, yes, then it will be... Everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> see drama, read books, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> And if you like, you can live with us. So where is the difficulty? <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">. Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> (pause) That American politician has predicted that "This Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, within ten years, they will capture our government." (laughs) So do it actually. Then it will be very nice. It is not... Simply take the people in your favor; the government is yours. That they are afraid of. The young boys, they are taking Hare Kṛṣṇa movement seriously, so the government can be changed in their favor. After all, it is democracy. So you can do it. You become president. You become senator. In America it is possible. And if America accepts... What about this new president? Or... Formerly I heard about him that he is religious man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> His mother is... She was working in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> So she's very favorable towards India. She was some type of social worker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His mother? Oh. Then at least he has got some good thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> He said... There's a movie star in Bombay, and he is, he's a friend of this Carter. So Jagat Puruṣa is going to approach him. He's a very good friend of..., because his mother, she was working in India and she knew this family. So they have a lot of friends in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least let them understand the philosophy. Balavanta may see and explain the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Balavanta knows him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Did Balavanta meet him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I think so. Balavanta... There was one man, a black man who was running for mayor at the same time that Balavanta was, for Atlanta. And that black man dropped out of the race and supported Balavanta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a black man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. Then, later on, that man he was appointed Lieutenant Governor under Carter. So Carter and this man are close, and through this man Carter knows about Balavanta and the movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have written one letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Balavanta is very intelligent boy. He can do that. Bring that spring water, little. You can type this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> On your letterhead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, one of the students is just about fifteen, and he's been initiated now for a year and I'd like to recommend him for second initiation. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...good hope for preaching in China. I have received letter from Trivikrama Mahārāja. What she is doing, Carter's mother, here? He's in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Not anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> She must have been a missionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Part of the Peace Corps or something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, that's it. She worked in the Peace Corps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Peace port?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Peace Corps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's an American organization. It sends out people all over the world to help the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like a social worker's organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Like when they have earthquakes and hurricanes in countries, the Peace Corps will go there and they will do all the nursing and doctoring and helping people get homes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So unless there is earthquake, they will not work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, that's not the Peace Corps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They send Peace Corps... Tejas was in Peace Corps. Tejas was in the Peace Corps. He was sent to India. In Telegu Nagara he was helping with agriculture. He would go to some village, underdeveloped. He would teach them how to plant nicely, fertilize, different things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He knows about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, he knows all about agriculture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Why don't we send him to Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He worked there for about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him go to Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He knows all about agriculture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And he speaks the language too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It was Kennedy's idea, the Peace Corps. Kennedy started. They started it because many young men did not want to go in the Army, but Army was forcible. So they said, "If you go in the Peace Corps, then you don't have to go in the war corps; you don't have to go in Army." So many people took that: "Oh, we'll go in the Peace Corps. We'll go as an alternative."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> It has lost its popularity now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> It is not very popular now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> In fact, in India they have ordered to leave practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> They say they had some connection with the CIA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Yes, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a politician. That you cannot blame. Politics require all these things. A politician cannot be a saintly person. That is not possible. For politics he has to do so many things. That is necessary. Just like Arjuna wanted to be a nonviolent. Immediately it was condemned by Kṛṣṇa, "What is this nonsense? You are a military man. Nonviolent." And similarly, politicians, they require all this. Businessman must deal in black market. It is inevitable. Otherwise he cannot improve. Because the world is bad, you, if you become honest, then you cannot make pros..., cannot become prosperous. <span class="Italic">Sate sārtham samācaret.(?) Brāhmaṇa's</span> dealing must be very straight and honest. They are not meant for politics or business. They are for transcendental knowledge. Kṛṣṇa conscious person should be all-inclusive. He must be a politician, he must be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he must be a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> he must be a <span class="Italic">śūdra-</span>everything. All-inclusive. Because he is transcendental. In otherwise he is neither a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> neither a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> neither a... Yes. <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ vipro na ca nara-patir na yatir vā.</span> Neither of these. In other side he is everything. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. As Kṛṣṇa is sometimes cowherd boy, politician, sometimes dancing with, artist-He is everything, not one-sided. So all food is finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All vegetable also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> All vegetable, all <span class="Italic">puris</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. [break] ...Hindi book or English book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You sold English book or Hindi book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hindi magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Magazine only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, everyone took magazines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I think there were some other books also. I didn't check that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something he must take, he will read, understand our philosophy. [break] ...Carter is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Yes, I got a letter from Dharmādhyakṣa in Surat two months ago. He was invited to the White House after our... He had an exhibition at Vancouver, that habitat. So it was a world conference of solution to life, living. So he was invited. He met some of the officials there. He was invited to Washington, but he had to wait for Carter to become the President because then it would be fifty percent more favorable because they had a relationship. There these people... Then he said there's a great chance they will help us in India. So he is going to go there and speak with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> No, Washington, D.C. That's in America. They invited one of our devotees there to discuss this Māyāpura and all this social type of... Dharmādhyakṣa. He's writing for that Back to Godhead magazine. He worked with Gurudāsa together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His article, one is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, "Simple Living High Thinking." You saw that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he met him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Not Carter. He met the government officials who were representing the United States Government at that exhibition, and they were very favorable. They were one of the most favorable, he said, the United states.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, our "plain living, high thinking" is very nice idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually it's the only practical solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Mr. Carter is a farmer, peanut farmer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's how he gained his money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> He's the biggest peanut farmer in America. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He started out in the military, he was in the Navy. Then afterwards... His father had a peanut farm, and then his father became sick, so then he gave up his Navy thing. He came back to take care of the family. Then he began that peanut business. Now he doesn't have to do it any more because now he has made millions. He is wealthy man, very wealthy. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...capture American government. Then all world will follow. As they are known as Communists, we should be known as Hare Kṛṣṇas. We are already known as such, Hare Kṛṣṇas. Keep that name. People at least chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already well advertised all over the world. So keep this name, Hare Kṛṣṇas. "Vote for Hare Kṛṣṇas." Anywhere you live, you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. All right, you can go. (end)</div>
