<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And Śrīla Prabhupāda said "Now you can go," otherwise he would not leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And take some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His father and mother are also very nice here. They are doing great service, both of them working in the restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many children are coming, very fortunate children, from the beginning Kṛṣṇa conscious. We had the chance of taking birth from such father and mother. So all these children should be taken care of very nicely. Oh, yes. They'll be asset for our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Future hope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Therefore I wanted to organize the <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> very nicely. We have no objection. Let them produce hundreds of children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said that your Guru Mahārāja said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "If I could produce Kṛṣṇa conscious children, I am prepared to produce hundreds of children." What is the use of producing children like cats and dogs? Produce children like Prahlāda Mahārāja. The whole world will be benefited. <span class="Italic">Ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca.</span> [break] Progeny, that is not condemned. Why it should be condemned? Let there be pregnancy, but Kṛṣṇa conscious. That, our Pradyumna's son, these, all children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Aniruddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. They should be trained up properly. Special care should be taken. That is the idea of my Guru Mahārāja, a <span class="Italic">Gurukula. Gurukula,</span> we are not going to make some big, big scholars. We don't require scholars. We require ideal men by character, by behavior, by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Not by studying grammar. There are many grammarians. Let them study our books nicely, English, little Sanskrit, that's all. <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> organize like that. We don't want big, big scholars. Unnecessarily. There are so many scholars in the universities, drinking and woman-hunting, that's all. In the universities, I know, to get the degree, pass the examination, the girls have to adopt prostitution with the teachers, I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Especially in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That to pass the examination by prostitution. Whatever nonsense they may write, that's all right. This is Central Park still?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Central Park West, it's called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not education. Everything is killing. Therefore we are supposed to deal with all madmen. They are thinking that they are constructing such big, big buildings, they are the most exalted persons, but we take them as mad.</div>
<div class="Verse">piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya<br class="calibre2"/>māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Ghostly haunted. A person ghostly haunted, as he does, acts, similarly, anyone who is under the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he acts like this. [break] ...this church, I came. They purchased one set of books. And one lady, Mrs. McGuire I think, she arranged this meeting. Underneath there is subway. I was sitting there and the subway sound was <span class="Italic">cut-cut cut-cut cut-cut.</span> So I asked what is this and they said subway. Within this building there is subway. I think they are repairing. What is this building? That museum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This one? It's the Museum of Natural History.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Memorial of Theodore Roosevelt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This man Theodore Roosevelt, he was one of the presidents. He was a big hunter, he used to kill animals. And in front it says that he was famous for being a natural conservationist, protecting nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a big planetarium here also at this museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Biggest in the world, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, this planetarium is the most famous one, Heydn Planetarium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So see how the planetarium is done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we should go, Rāmeśvara. Have you ever gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Many years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should we go to see it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They use all kinds of lighting systems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you take the idea. We shall have to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. All right. They have a special projector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, we may take the idea and utilize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In our planetarium, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we want to actually show the different qualities of life on the different planetary systems also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, as far as possible. There is Siddhaloka, they can go from one planet to another without any machine, without any vehicle. Siddhaloka means, just like the yogis, they can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their body have..., they have wings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No wings. We think only our ideas, that without wings nobody can fly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That picture wasn't accurate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That was Gandharvaloka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda said they don't have wings either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are purchasing this house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we thought you like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is nice house. It is half or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, full. This one is very nice too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also for sale?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think, but it's very good for the temple, big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purchase the whole property. (out of car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seems like it's two different buildings. It is two different buildings. It's just the left side, corner building. In fact, the corner building may be a different one also. What, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She was speaking "You are threatening my dog"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, she said "Don't touch my dog." She yelled at us, "Don't touch my dog."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He had a muzzle on. See this man here, Śrīla Prabhupāda? He's emptied out all the wastepaper baskets all over the grass, and now he's searching through to see if there's anything of any value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is valuable there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Someone may have thrown something out which he could use. He's a bum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another madman. In Hong Kong I have seen, they are searching some food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You can see in every big city, mainly older people, they go and look in all the rubbish bins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like they'll find an empty bottle, and if they return the bottle to the shop, they'll get a deposit, ten or fifteen cents for a bottle deposit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Māyāpura we've seen the little children coming looking for <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> left over in the rubbish outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is one of the big problems in the world today. They don't know how to dispose of all the paper and garbage that they go through. They are selling so many goods, and then they have to throw away the packages. They don't know how to get rid of the garbage. They try to throw it in the ocean sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And for manufacturing the paper they are cutting so many trees and committing sinful life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The scientists report that by throwing all this garbage in the ocean they kill many fish. Here in New York there is one beach called Coney Island, and no fish can live near the shore, they are all dying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they are so sympathetic to the fish? Because they will eat it. No? They are thinking that "We shall eat the fish, and they are dying." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Do you want your hat, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? No. This is ventilation. (laughter) You are feeling cold? Mister? You are feeling cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's that same lady again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we went to one other part of the park down there, and we found they have a big statue of a dog there, and it says "In honor of the dogs." Some sled-dogs that came and saved some people in Alaska in 1926, a big statue of a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got some? Children are not affected. Old men are affected. For children, if there is diarrhea, it is good, but old man, if there is diarrhea he is going to die. [break] ...evolution of man, what about the trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trees and plants and aquatics and insects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They don't say anything much about trees, but they say aquatics eventually became walking animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, when the ocean dried up, then they had to develop lungs to breathe. But there is a type of fish that walks. So they say that this fish gradually developed legs and lungs and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The fish walks on his fins. They say after millions of years of walking on his fins, gradually the fins became legs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It is African lung-fish. It lives in the mud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they do not speak anything about trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Not that I've ever seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> I've never seen anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, they say the organisms that were originally in the water, and when there was some land formed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is this grass evolving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say that the wind blows the seeds. Or animals drop them. They also say that flying animals, like birds, came from the sea in one form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard one island had just appeared sometime back from a volcano underneath the ocean in the middle of the Pacific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's one near Norway as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The scientists wanted to find out how long it would take before life appeared on this island in the middle of nowhere. So they were thinking it might take thousands of millions and billions of years, because there had been no life there to begin with. But they found that within one year it was full of so much plants, vegetation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, how rascal they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That should disprove all of their theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They speak all... That the egg will take millions of years and the chicken is bringing within five days. So why these rascals do not transfer their doctorate title to the chicken (laughter) instead of bluffing other rascals that "We are doctorate"? They should be ashamed to keep their doctorate. "Now let us transfer to the chicken; within five days there is life." Huh? What do you think? Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I am sure you are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The chicken is bringing from the egg life within five days, and they are calculating millions of years. Such rascals are passing as scientists. If chemical is the basis of life, just make some experiment, take the chemical and make a small egg and put into the incubator and bring life. Why they do not, hmm? It will take millions of years, and the chicken is bringing within five days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They say in a few years they will do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why few years? Rascaldom. Dr. Chicken is doing in five days, so why you enjoy this title? You give up. You be ashamed. You are shameless, therefore you are talking all this nonsense. You have no human sense also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They say that in the laboratory we are working on this, and very soon we will have the answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means that you are a rascal. You admit that you are a rascal. We see one sparrow bringing within few days, life. So many birds, they are bringing life within few days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say there are certain chemicals in the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, you rascal, big chemist, you combine these chemicals and bring life. Why do you not do that? Simply talking millions and trillions of years just to bluff other rascals. You are a rascal and you are bluffing other rascals. That is your business, and getting high salary, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even they can take a dead body, there's no need to manufacture the body, and try and put life back into it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, give him some chemicals. So many dead bodies are being wasted. Give some chemical and let them come back in life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They are freezing the bodies sometimes, so that in the future when they perfect that ability, they'll revive these dead bodies and they'll live again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...things are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...science called genetics, where they study the chemicals which determine the characteristics of the living entity, whether he has fair skin, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That our Svarūpa Dāmodara has begun with this rascal genetics. He has written that <span class="Italic">Scientific Basis,</span> beginning with these rascals, genetics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Before they can try to create life, they have to master this science of genetics first. This controls whether a living entity has different color eyes and hair and ability to hear and see, everything. So they say when they have mastered that science, then the next step will be to create life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will take millions of years. By that time he'll be finished. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Sometimes people say that although the body changes, the genes are the same, therefore it's not the soul that continues in the body, but these genes. So they argue that we're this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...that by genetics they can develop the higher qualities in man, and they can arrange at birth to develop the finest qualities, strength, different talents also, like artistic talents, musical talents, better intelligence, all by chemistry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how much chemical he has devoured for becoming so intelligent? That man who is proposing chemicals, so how much quantity of chemical he has eaten to speak all this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> One of their programs is selective breeding. Only let the so-called intelligent people have children and let all the unintelligent people not have any children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then who will clean up the park if they do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> No one does it anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are thinking that in the future they can make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All future. (dog barking) Future, however pleasant. Post-dated check. Future, millions of years after, you'll get payment, take this check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> This dog is after everyone, it attacks everyone that comes by, and the lady gets angry when they try to get the dog away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there fish here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's just the water moving, little waves, that's all. This is just a pond for sailing model boats, so I don't think there'd be any fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There's fish in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Fish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The fish eat up the algae, keep it clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...skyscraper building, how many stories they can build? Is there any estimation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Over a hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, how many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There is no exact figure; they are always making higher. Now I think a hundred and thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, it's more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> A hundred thirty, a hundred forty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when they'll fall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> When the earthquake comes, boom, everything finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That structure you saw in Toronto, that big tower? That's supposed to be the highest free-standing structure in the world. Over fifteen hundred feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In Boston there is one big skyscraper, John Hancock Building, and they cannot utilize it because... What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Every time the wind blows it begins to bend back and forth in the breeze.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It swings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> It swings back and forth in the breeze, and all the windows fell out. When we were two years ago in Boston, every day we used to hear how more windows had fallen in, so they made it all with wood. So it was a huge skyscraper with wood in the windows instead of glass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Still they are not utilizing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> No, it's still bent, it cracked open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It cost them over sixty, seventy million dollars and they cannot use it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> It cracked all the concrete in the sidewalk because it was bending back and forth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no estimation, that "So far we can come, then we'll fall"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It all depends upon the foundation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In New York they can build them so high because the entire island of Manhattan is made out of rock, and there's never any earthquakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Not yet, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> As far as I know, they think that they can make them bigger and bigger without any limit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Four hundred stories [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And fell down later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There is a story in the Bible how they were trying to build this big building, the Tower of Babel, and then the whole thing... Because they were so proud, God made them all speak different languages so they could not communicate with one another, and the whole project was finished. They were trying to build a huge building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They were actually trying to reach God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes. To reach heaven. That is how the Christians, in Christianity, explain that people speak different languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Japan they never build big buildings because they know the earthquakes will come. They have maybe ten, twelve stories at the most.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] The big ones in New York, they build in such a way that it's very difficult to evacuate them in case of a fire, and this movie company did a movie of the two buildings burning up. So after that no one would move into them. They were half empty. So the city had to move all of its government offices into the buildings just to fill them. (dog barking) The Russian dogs are the largest dogs in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Dogs to hunt wolves. These dogs are used to hunt wolves in Russia. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car) ...<span class="Italic">saṅge calo, ei mātra bhikhā cāi.</span> "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and come with us," that's all. We don't want any more. No fees. We don't say, "First of all pay so many dollars." There is no condition. "Simply chant and come here. We shall arrange for your food, we shall arrange for your shelter, everything." Still they will not come. They will go and pay fees and chant nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe we should charge, then they will become more encouraged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Others will be discouraged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The ones who are paying are the ones who want to be cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The ones who are paying are the ones that want to be cheated, and the ones who come here are the ones that are serious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You once said that the scientists are the number-one enemy of mankind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not enemy, but because they are bluffing, "There is no God, everything is science..." That is their foolishness. We are protesting against that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> People have a lot of faith that the world is making progress through the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What progress they have made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Towards destruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have they stopped death? What is progress? After all, we are going to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have increased the chance of death. They only have increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even not increase, even it is very comfortable, but you have to die. First of all check this. You have to become old. What you have done in that direction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Killing people quicker so that they don't have to face old age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have bluffed everyone that the life duration has increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they have said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> By the improvement in medicine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right, accepting increase, but it is not that death is stopped. Just like they have made so many medical improvements, but that does not mean that they have stopped disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they don't claim they can stop death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. What is the improvement? If you stop disease, then it is improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say no one can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are subordinate. Do not claim all in all because you are scientist. Then you are controlled. You have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We accept that no one is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, controlled. That is their defect. They are being controlled in every step, still, they think they are free. That is their defect. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are fully controlled by the laws of nature, still the great rascal, he's thinking that he's free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But gradually, they say, we will learn to control nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That gradual, that will never come, and that is their another foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes they are seeing, though, that by their endeavors they are successful. Just like they may try to cure some disease, and then sometimes they are seeing that they are baffled. This leads them to think they are independent. This is leading them to think that they are independent, that sometimes they are successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they try their best, but still they are baffled. That means they admit there is some controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But because they are all Dr. Frog, they are thinking that things are so far out of their control that no one can control it, that material nature is not controlled by anyone. They are thinking that because they cannot control material nature, then no one can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are being controlled. They, themselves, being controlled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they say nature means laws, impersonal laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, impersonal laws, but you are controlled, rascal. That you admit. Whatever it may be, you rascal, you are controlled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say if everyone joined this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, then no one would have any desire to invent the automobile, the airplane...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is useless waste of time. The sooner they give up all these attempts, they become saner. [break]... it is said it is simply waste of time. <span class="Italic">Yato āyur vyayaḥ param.</span> Simply wasting time, valuable life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara: :</span>But the natural instinct is to want to enjoy varieties...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material life. The material life means falsely he's thinking that he'll be happy by material adjustment. That is material life. Falsely he's thinking. He'll never be happy, but they are thinking like that. <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. Durāśayā</span> means this hope will never be fulfilled. That is called <span class="Italic">durāśayā,</span> a hope which is not going to be successful at any time. And throughout the whole history they have tried, the British Empire, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire, so many they tried, but all failed. Napoleon, Hitler, but still they have no eyes to see. From the history you see, everything failed. Napoleon started with some ideal, conquering all over Europe, and at last he had to die drinking horse urine. You know that? It was, later on he was arrested by British, and when he was asking drinking water he was given horse urine. That was his last life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was when he died? He died then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was so much insulted. Because every European countries were harassed, they had very bad idea about this Napoleon. Unnecessarily expanding the interest of France. "France and Napoleon, one." Now where is that rascal? France is there. This is going on. British Empire means bring money, hook or crook, in London, and you get the title, "lord," "baron," this... This was their policy. "Sir." All hooligans, thieves, rogues, they were made big, big respectable people. A deposit in the government, this lord family means they have to deposit, say, ten million pounds, like that, and the government takes that money as fixed deposit, and the interest the family will maintain the aristocracy. This is the lord's family. Some way or other you deposit ten million pounds and your family becomes lord's family. So people become mad after money, somehow or other bring money. There was no other culture. In order to introduce their Manchester cloth, how they killed the home industry of India, cloth merchant, this weaver... Just like we are trying. It is very long time, this, the handloom. They cut the finger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The British did that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The British did that so that the weavers could not work, just to introduce their Manchester's cloth. So many things they did. It is in the history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America you never hear such history, in school...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They simply killed the Red Indians, that is the only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But in the schools they never tell you these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they will tell, shameful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In England it was "How we saved India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now who is saving India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say the "white man's burden." They came to make India civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They showed us this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore all the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> they bring it within Christian era. Before that, India was uncivilized. And if they accept all the Vedic literature, so exalted, then they have to accept Indian civilization. That is their propaganda. Simply propaganda, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's why you say Darwinism was started by the English...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...to discredit the Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's just like a bunch of demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It seems like it's such a concerted effort, a conspiracy of all the leaders of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Greed conspiracy. Leaders, the bankers they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's another deep point. Scientists are pointing to the bankers, each group points to the other, and they all cheat together. Just like we used to do... (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> These demons, Śrīla Prabhupāda, all of them are <span class="Italic">dehātma-buddhi</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, all they have... (end)</div>
