<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...could not eat one cāpāṭi. (laughter-Prabhupāda laughs) Later on: "Bring more!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Prabhupāda was feeding us all from his own plate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sit down. [break] New spoon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> Yes, a new spoon. I think Jagannātha-sūta bought it, and a few others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That article is very nice, Jagannātha's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> Er, Jagjīvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jagjīvana. Jagjīvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> There's one article that he wrote for the BTG and a reply that Viśvakarmā made. Prabhupāda just read the article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I brought some pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, very nice, the Deities. (indistinct) Kiśora-Kiśorī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, it's beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.... [break] Colors?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They have many different outfits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> All of the <span class="Italic">mukuṭas</span> and the jewelry, everything is made there at New Vrindaban. We have very expert, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...can have so many engagements. Simply by making dress, we remain Kṛṣṇa conscious. Simply by cooking, we remain Kṛṣṇa conscious. Simply by cleansing the floor, we remain Kṛṣṇa conscious. Easiest method. Everyone can remain Kṛṣṇa conscious in any circumstance. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> It is not condition that "You have to become like this; then you'll become Kṛṣṇa conscious." No. In whatever position you are, you become Kṛṣṇa conscious. No extra intelligence required. <span class="Italic">Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau **.</span> Either you dress the Deity or you cleanse the floor of the temple, the same thing. You get the result the same. <span class="Italic">Tan-mandira-mārjanādau.</span> Anything you do. Somebody is cleansing, somebody is chanting, somebody is cooking, somebody is printing, somebody is selling books-everything is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And that is the best yoga. <span class="Italic">Sa me yuktatamo mataḥ. Yoginām api sarveṣām: [Bg. </span>6.47] "Of all the yogis, who is thinking of Me, always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the topmost yogi." "By meditation I am trying to become God. By meditation one can become God." This is their foolish theory. Kṛṣṇa, when He exhibited His godly power at the age of three months, where was meditation? (laughs) God is always God. You cannot become by meditation God. You can become godly; that is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> People become very enamored by this mystic display. You were speaking about mystic power, and peo...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four annas. (laughter) For four annas I'll have to try for four hundred years. Why mystic power? To show some jugglery-"How I can fly in the sky, I can walk on the water"-by this mystic power, they create amazement and become imitation God. Imitation God you can become, but you cannot become real God. That is not possible. That is warned. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Asamaurdhva:</span> "Nobody equal to Me; nobody better than Me." So why should you waste your time to become God? You cannot become actually. So why should you waste your time? Remain servant. Then you're actually.... Get this light. No, no that, inside. You can give me little pineapple juice. Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Right now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can sit down here. Then also for <span class="Italic">mahārājas.</span> So when you started from New Vrindaban?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you are coming directly here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By plane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. I left New Vrindaban about nine o'clock. The plane left Pittsburgh at 11:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Arrived here at 3:15.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pittsburgh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We stopped in Chicago for one hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You go to Detroit from here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That is the program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Satsvarūpa Mahārāja and Jayādvaita will be in Detroit also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Anxiously waiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen our Detroit, new?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is a great palace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I have heard it is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was constructed by spending six million dollars. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Many years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and it is nice palace, and we got it for 300,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda personally made the arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. That man was asking 350,000, so, just like ordinary arrangement, ten percent down, so I made a bargain: "All right, I'll give you 300,000 cash. Accept it." So he immediately accepted. (laughs) There was no money. Then one girl contributed 150,000, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Is that the Reuther girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And our Ford, Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, he also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have some fresh pineapples and a juicing machine just across the road, so someone has gone for some now. It'll be five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen the new publication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I was just looking at it. He was saying that you had two copies, and I said, "Ask for one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you may take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They are getting better and better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And our Rāmeśvara Mahārāja is guiding them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, he's very expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the other copy? Other copy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Other copy.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's in here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That gentleman who came, sitting in chair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That Indian man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Indian man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> The print is larger in this volume?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's the new standard since the Fifth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I just, I typed a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I read a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The juice should be two minutes. Śrīla Prabhupāda, the pictures in this new <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> are the best yet. (people coming in and out of the room)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> These books will satisfy everyone, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> These books will satisfy everyone's desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they want blood and thunder, it's this. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can give one shirt to him and one to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's getting one now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's got one. He's getting one for Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda is giving him one of his personal shirts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> A lawyer, he's come to see your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> in the garden for the last two nights. He's been giving us a lot of assistance in our legal needs. He seems to be very inquisitive about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He's downstairs now. I wonder if he could come up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has some inquiries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, he seems to be eating up the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He's very eager to hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He's downstairs right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's charging us lower rates, doing, working as hard as he can for us at practically no profit to himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, something must be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Can I ask him to come up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> This is the greatest gift, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The greatest contribution, Prabhupāda said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda has asked that all the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> take one shirt. [break] (conversation continues after entrance of guest)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants chair?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He likes sitting Indian style. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> No, this is fine, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His name is Jay Warner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I.... <span class="Italic">Ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ:</span>"Anything which is accepted by leading men, that is accepted by others." So you are one of the leading men in the society, lawyer. If you understand our philosophy, then many others will follow. So kindly try to understand our philosophy thoroughly, and then others will follow: "He's big lawyer. He's a Kṛṣṇa conscious man." If you have any doubt, you can ask. We will try to explain. <span class="Italic">Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu</span> [Bg. 7.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. [break] It must be distinct from other paintings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Who did that painting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think that was done.... Everyone has done one picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That picture of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva killing all the demon armies, it's a most amazing picture. He has about twenty arms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> I do have one question. How can one establish faith in the principle of reincarnation? How can one come to believe in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Incarnation of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Reincarnation, transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very simple thing. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Now, you were a child. That's a fact. Were you not a child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You were a child before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Where is the body of the child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You were a child. Where is that body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> It has grown into a man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grown, or it is changed? The same thing. But that child, that body, is no more existing. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Yes, it is gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body may vanquish, but you are going through. That is incarnation. The child body is vanquished; it is no more existing. Either you say grow or I may say it has changed, that body is finished. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are still existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> I still feel that I am myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means you were in the child body and you are in this young man's body. So you are existing, but the body has changed. What is the difficulty to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Where is it difficult to answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> (all at once) What is the difficulty to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are.... When the child's body, that body, is no more existing, you are in a different body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> The difficulty for me reaches the moment, retroactively, before the moment of birth, or past the moment of death. How can one come to have faith that there is life after one leaves his body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the proof. A child may not understand that there is, after his childhood body, there is another body, boyhood body or youthful body. He may not understand. But that is the fact. If the child says, "There is no more body. This is the final body," that is not the fact. He is going to get another body which is boy's body, young man's body, old man's body. Similarly, you may believe or not believe, you are going to get another body. The proof is that you have no more the child's body; you have got a different body. The common sense reasoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> That is true. But the difficulty for me is that although my spirit wants to believe in transmigration, the scientific upbringing that was inculcated in me from a child has a hard time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that scientific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Through empirical evidence, through evidence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is evidence. I ask you to show me your childhood body. Where it is? Can you show? That is finished. So if the childhood body finished, you get another body, boyhood body. Similarly, the conclusion should be that after this body-I am old man; it will be finished-then I'll get another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> That makes sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very common sense. But we are so dull-headed we cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> I am so what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are so dull-headed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> We, dull-headed.... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in the, what is called, movie spool....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Film strip.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Film, yes. There are hundreds of bodies in the film, and when they are played, it seems that it's the same-one man is moving-but actually, in the film there are hundreds of bodies, but it is changing so swiftly it appears one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> A man's eye cannot see it changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> A man's eye cannot see it change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By nature's law it is changing every second in such swift way that we cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> How does one give up the fear of dying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no death. You change body. Because the body is lost, you are no more, you do not possess the childhood body, youth-hood body, that does no mean you are dead. You are living; the body has changed. But because we do not know the science, we think "The body is finished; therefore he's dead." Therefore you have to learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā-na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit.</span> Find out the verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span>"For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. So as a lawyer, when there is some dispute, you refer to the lawbook. Similarly, when there is dispute how the soul is immortal, the body is changing, you refer to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You find it clear, <span class="Italic">na jāyate na mriyate,</span> clearly said. Explain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Purport? "Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the supreme spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Just bring little salt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "...or <span class="Italic">kūṭa-stha.</span> The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother's body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval-that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man therefore feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls, and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul's presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body. In the <span class="Italic">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> also we find a similar passage which reads:</div>
<div class="Verse">na jāyate mriyate vā vipaścin<br class="calibre2"/>nāyaṁ kutaścin na babhūva kaścit<br class="calibre2"/>ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇo<br class="calibre2"/>na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.20]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but here in this verse there is one special word, <span class="Italic">vipaścit,</span> which means learned or with knowledge. The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies-whether man or animal-we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme, because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge-past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa is not like the forgetful soul. If so, Kṛṣṇa's teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> would be useless. There are two kinds of souls-namely the minute particle soul, <span class="Italic">aṇu-ātmā,</span> and the Supersoul, the <span class="Italic">vibhu-ātmā.</span> This is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> in this way:</div>
<div class="Verse">aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān<br class="calibre2"/>ātmāsya jantor nihito guhāyām<br class="calibre2"/>tam akratuḥ paśyati vīta-śoko<br class="calibre2"/>dhātuḥ prasādān mahimānam ātmanaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">'Both the Supersoul, <span class="Italic">Paramātmā,</span> and the atomic soul, <span class="Italic">jīvātmā,</span> are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.' Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa, or by His bona fide representative, the spiritual master."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got any question upon this statement, the statement given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in the purport we have explained? If you have got any question over it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> Excuse me, I didn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Do you have any question about what Prabhupāda has written here, about the purport, any question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jay Warner:</span> I think I understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That's a beautiful purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That's a nice purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think we're supposed to go for the movie.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I think we're supposed to go for the movie.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, when?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is ready. It is.... Everything is prepared. (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 9, 1976, Los Angeles</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...afraid of me, what kind of child? (laughs) Where you got so much strength?" And the answer here,</div>
<div class="Verse">na kevalaṁ me bhavataś ca rājan<br class="calibre2"/>sa vai balaṁ balināṁ cāpareṣām<br class="calibre2"/>pare 'vare 'mī sthira-jaṅgamā ye<br class="calibre2"/>brahmādayo yena vaśaṁ praṇītāḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"Prahlāda Mahārāja said, 'My dear King, the source of my strength, of which you are asking, is also the source of yours, by which you are challenging. Indeed, the original source of all kinds of strength is one. He is not only your strength or mine, but the only strength for everyone. Without Him, no one can get any strength, whether moving or not moving, superior or inferior. Everyone, including Lord Brahmā, is controlled by the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' " So,</div>
<div class="Verse">so 'haṁ vikatthamānasya<br class="calibre2"/>śiraḥ kāyād dharāmi te<br class="calibre2"/>gopāyeta haris tvādya<br class="calibre2"/>yas te śaraṇam īpsitam</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"All right, let me see how your strength is coming. Now I shall kill you, come on. Let me see (laughs) how your God is coming to save you." This is atheism, challenging. And when He appeared, the Hiraṇyakaśipu became a fly (laughs) in front of.... Eh? Where is such language? Even there are many Sanskrit scholars now, they cannot produce such language. That is not possible. And five thousand years before, Vyāsadeva presented this unique language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is the twentieth volume of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> now printed, twentieth volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Number twenty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> series.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Out of sixty. Still forty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So you have already finished two more volumes at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda says out of sixty volumes, twenty are already printed, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty already printed, and two or three ready for being printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> But this is the bulk of the cantos, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, Tenth Canto will be very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> The Tenth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tenth Canto will be like <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> fifteen volumes, Tenth Canto. Generally six chapters a volume, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Depending on the size.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, generally. So there are ninety chapters. That means minimum fifteen volumes, and maybe more. We have presented <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, just a summary study, not explained. But when it will be explained, with each and every <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> purport, then it will be not less than fifteen volumes. Tenth Chapter is the face of of the Lord. We have described the legs, hands, belly, that's all, and Tenth Chapter is the face, smiling face. Therefore we should not jump over the face all at once. It must go from the legs, gradually, and then face, then forehead, then hair. Eleventh, Twelfth, Twelfth Chapter, finished, the whole body of Kṛṣṇa. Hmm. So thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? We'd like to put.... We have got in some other copies, and we would like to put them on the altar tonight for <span class="Italic">sandhyā ārati.</span> These two are your copies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But those two are for Your Divine Grace. We have others to show the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. All right, do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, how you are keeping your health?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Pretty good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's.... And things are going nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. The devotees are all anxious for you, to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Hayagrīva Mahārāja is being forced? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> You should cane me more, Śrīla Prabhupāda</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa is very cunning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> I know. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (still laughing) One may try to leave Him, but He is not going to leave you. Once come, "No sir, you cannot go out." Just like our Ajāmila. He was devotee in the beginning, and later on, by bad association of prostitute, he fell, but Kṛṣṇa took him at the end. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> Kṛṣṇa gave him chance to give him a son. He kept the son's name Nārāyaṇa. So on account of affection of the son, he was chanting, "Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa." Just Kṛṣṇa is so kind that (laughs) "All right, this rascal is going out of My hand. All right, give him a child, Nārāyaṇa. He will chant, 'Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa,' and that will be his credit." <span class="Italic">Ajñāta-sukṛti. Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate. Sukṛti,</span> pious activities, of many millions of birth is not equal to love of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate. Tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyaṁ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā-matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate:</span> "Purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness anywhere it is available." What is the price? <span class="Italic">Tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyam:</span> "Only greediness, hankering. That is the price." "Oh, that I have got." "No, no. <span class="Italic"> Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate.</span> You cannot obtain this price even after millions of births' pious activities." All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
