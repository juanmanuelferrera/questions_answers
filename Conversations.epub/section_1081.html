<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the right side is darkness. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian reporter):</span> Obviously we have selected darkness. That is what we want to do. We want to go into light later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are requesting something... <span class="Italic">Veda</span> says, "Come to the light." <span class="Italic">Tamaso mā jyotir gamaya:</span> "Don't remain in darkness. Come to the light."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We want more light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Tamaso mā jyotir gamaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is desirable in human. Otherwise the animals are in darkness. They do not know what is God. But a human being, because he has got this human form of body, he can come to the light. So all the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> are for the human being, not for the cats and dogs. So if you do not take advantage of the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> then you remain in the darkness. This is our position. The light is here. Just like apart from all other <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> if you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is the very brilliant light. It is not that changing. Five thousand years ago Kṛṣṇa said, what, that is still the same thing. Just like light. Millions of years ago, what was sun, the same sun is there. In the light there is no change. In the darkness there is change. If we do not accept the standard knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then we shall continue to remain in darkness and there will be no solution of the problems of life. This is our propaganda. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means that we are asking everywhere, all over the world, "You come to this light and be happy." That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, tell us something good, this <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> that you're doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Mahāṁśa... Where is Mahāṁśa? <span class="Italic">Āśrama</span> means an attempt to give some light. That is the difference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> According to us, even in lightness there is darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not light. That is called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> There also it can grow from one level to higher level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">ābhāsa. Ābhāsa.</span> Just like in the morning there is no full sunshine, but there is some glimpse of light. That is not real light. Real light is full sunshine but before the sun rises fully there is some light. That light and this light different. We have to come to the full light. Then our life will be success. Not partial light. That will not help. The full light you can get from the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> <span class="Italic">Jyotiṣām api taj jyotis tamasaḥ param ucyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. yes. Yes. So you take light from Kṛṣṇa. And that is full light, and you'll be happy. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Don't be satisfied with glimpse of light. Take full light. And that is open to everyone just like the sunshine is open to everyone. If you want to remain in the darkness, in the room, that is your business but you come to the... You can come to the full sunlight. That you can do. Where is the difficulty? Kṛṣṇa is open to everyone. He is speaking everything openly. There is no secret <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Everything is there. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.</span> This is open to everyone. Where is the difficulty? Unless we deny to accept Kṛṣṇa's instruction, there is no secret. Everything is open. But our leaders and scholars, they do not like to take Kṛṣṇa's instruction as it is. We are therefore insisting, we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, no interpretation. They say, "Why not interpretation?" That is the defect. We say no interpretation. You take Kṛṣṇa as it is, that's all. Then your life is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No interpretation is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What interpretation you can give? He is authority and what you are? You can give interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is self yoga necessity (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Simply... Yes. No, Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no more superior authority, more superior authority than Kṛṣṇa. And when Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth, He proved it. There was nobody superior than Him. That's a fact. Still He is superior. His <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is being studied all over the world with respect, determination, because He is still superior. That is superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">athavā bahunaitena<br class="calibre2"/>kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna<br class="calibre2"/>viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam<br class="calibre2"/>ekāṁśena sthito jagat<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 10.42]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are not changing. Because five thousand years have passed therefore, we have to make some additional, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then why should there be so many commentaries upon it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are rascaldom, that's all. Simple word, rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You cannot interpret on the words of God. You cannot interpret. Just like law. There is law by the government. You cannot interpret in your own way. You have to accept it. "Keep to the right"-no interpretation. You must keep to the right. That is law. If you say, "What is wrong if I go to the left?" Actually if one goes to the left, it is not very... But you cannot do it. As soon as you do it, you are criminal. You'll be punished. That is law. The <span class="Italic">dharma</span> means <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> If you want a general definition of <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or religion, that is given in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that "<span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means the law given by God." That is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> You cannot manufacture <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And because we are manufacturing so many <span class="Italic">dharmas,</span> mental concoctions, there is no peace. And Kṛṣṇa therefore says that "You give up this rascaldom." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> <span class="Italic">Tasmāc chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> means what is spoken by God and His representative. That's all. That is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Unless Kṛṣṇa accepts <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> how He saying like that? <span class="Italic">Tasmāc chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te. Śāstra</span> should be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> Some <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> must be existing before...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> Some <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> after, existing before Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śāstra? Śāstra</span> means it is authorized. Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> because it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority. Therefore all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they accept it. Still the <span class="Italic">ācārya-sampradāyas</span> are there. Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Śaṅkara, they accept all this. And at the time of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Do you accept the supremacy of the <span class="Italic">Vedas, veda-pramāṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> And if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, then you do not know what is <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> Your knowledge of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> will be accepted when you understand Kṛṣṇa. So if you do not know what Kṛṣṇa, then what is the use of taking so much trouble to study <span class="Italic">Vedas?</span> You do not know anything. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti.</span> That is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā.</span> If you do not know <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">, śrama eva hi kevalam:</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8] simply you have labored hard. That's all. You have gained nothing. And if you understood Vāsudeva, then you understood everything. <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> How do you explain <span class="Italic">vṛṣṇīnāṁ vāsudevo 'smi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He's the chief of everything. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the... He is the origin of everything. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> If you know the root, then you know the whole tree, where to water. If you water the root, so it, water goes. It goes to the highest twigs. You haven't got to take trouble to go to the up to pour water. You pour water in the root. This is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Once He says, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam,</span> and again He says, <span class="Italic">vṛṣṇīnāṁ vāsudevo 'smi.</span> So the meaning of that word is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So does it mean that He is not <span class="Italic">sarvam?</span> One who does not understand <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> particular, "It is also <span class="Italic">vāsudeva.</span> It is also <span class="Italic">vāsudeva.</span> It is also <span class="Italic">vāsudeva,</span>" that is called less intelligent. Otherwise one who is intelligent, he'll under..., <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti: [Bg. </span>7.19] "Everything is <span class="Italic">vāsudeva.</span>" <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā.</span> But if he has no intelligence, then "I am this, I am God. I am Kṛṣṇa." The same example, just like here is a tree. If I say, "The root, you pour water," here is everything. Otherwise this is also tree, the leaf is also tree, the twig also tree, the flower is also tree... You go on like that. They are of the same value. But if one is intelligent, he will understand, "Here is everything," <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam,</span> the root. That's all. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I was just telling this gentleman that the reporters may have some other questions also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is his wish. (pause) This is our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Through meditation you attain <span class="Italic">mukti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Through meditation ultimately you attain Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by meditation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I don't know, but normally it is understood to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are talking of meditation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Normally as it is understood by.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Concentration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which concentration? What is the subject?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> It can be from man to man, from... One may do it on Kṛṣṇa and one may do it on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not standard. If meditation is according to one's whims, that is not meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But it depends upon the faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> meditation means to meditate upon God. That is meditation. <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">. Yoginaḥ,</span> those who are yogis, they meditate upon the form of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> So through that, you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other things, they have manufactured concoctions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Maybe, but through that, you say you attain God, is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You attain God or what is the concept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Meditation means Kṛṣṇa. He says meditation. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:</span> "Just concentrate your mind upon Me." This is meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Then, in due course of time, do you see Him? Or in what form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, immediately you see Him. Kṛṣṇa's picture is there. Kṛṣṇa's picture and Kṛṣṇa is not different. So if you concentrate upon Kṛṣṇa, you immediately see Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You see Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, immediately. But if you think Kṛṣṇa has no form, then it is difficult. Immediately. Now He says, <span class="Italic">man-manāḥ.</span> He personally says, <span class="Italic">man-manāḥ,</span> so where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, the form of the light, you see or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why light? With two hands, two legs, He is speaking, <span class="Italic">man-manāḥ:</span> "Me." Why light? Light is another feature of His existence, but He says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.</span> Therefore we are presenting. <span class="Italic">Mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> In other words, do mean to say that you see Him in three dimensions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You see Him in three dimensions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unlimited dimension. Three dimension for you because You cannot see Him. Otherwise He is unlimited. That's it. But you cannot see unlimited. That is His mercy, that He presents Himself before you in three dimension because you have no eyes to see Him in His unlimited dimension. That is not possible. So it is His mercy. But He is not limited with three dimensions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, no, I'm not saying He is limited. As a man sees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because he is limited...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> As the man's concentration through which progresses, how, in what forms he goes on seeing Him? That is what my question is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore question is just simplified, that... Therefore we establish temple: "Here is Kṛṣṇa." That's all. If you say that "Kṛṣṇa is all pervading. Why shall I come to the temple?" And why not in the temple if He's all-pervading? But you say, "No, I am not going to see in the temple. I shall see outside in the sky." Then you don't see. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa is everywhere; why not in the temple? What is that argument? He is here also. But according to my capacity I can see temple, Kṛṣṇa, very easily. So Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> You come daily to the temple and see Him and think of Him. There is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, may I introduce the project over here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> May I introduce the press to the project over here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So by Kṛṣṇa's grace we have been given this plot of land which is 565 acres exactly, in two villages, that is, Dublipur(?) and Kanaipali villages. Lands are situated in the jurisdiction of these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Dublipur(?) and what is the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Kanaipali. And the lands were originally in the Venkateshvara Gorakshini Trust, and they have transferred these lands to ISKCON Venkateshvara Trust under the chairmanship of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. So our interest here is to... This area, the whole area here, is very dry. Although there is potency of..., there is potential for tapping water, it has been left dry and unused just like so much land all over. You can see. There is so much land which is unused, vacant, just like this. So we have been given this piece of land. We want to set an example of how such wasted land can be, with proper management and organization, it can be made usable to grow food, abundant food grains and fruits and to feed unlimited...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And offer them to Kṛṣṇa and distribute <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our mission. We are already giving <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> daily in the evening. There is no question of making profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> So anyone can come and live here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Irrespective of religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Actually that is happening. Somebody has come from Germany, somebody from (indistinct), somebody Australia, somebody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> And even if he doesn't subscribe the <span class="Italic">śikṣā</span> to which you want them to. Even those who don't subscribe to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how he can live? If he does not live like us, then how he can live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> That is his question. Supposing he doesn't subscribe, still will he be allowed to come and live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if he lives, then he will subscribe. <span class="Italic">Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.</span> If you associate with good men you become a good man. If you associate with drunkard, you become drunkard. So we are giving the chance. Associate with us and you'll be devotee. That is becoming. So we are giving that chance. Come and live with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> And what are the other point of stress in temples...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. To facilitate a harmonious Kṛṣṇa conscious community we will have all facilities. There will be temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them come here, live peacefully, eat sumptuously, get all the other necessities of life and become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is our... And we have no discrimination, Hindu, Muslim, Christian. No. We have got many Christians, many Jews, many Hindus, many Muslims, many Africans. They are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Even in India, Muslims are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Muslim India or same India, those who are intelligent, they are taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> In this country also they have taken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Some of the Pakistanis, they have taken. Of course, he is living in foreign country. One Dr. Ramjan (?), he is the professor in Portland. He is my disciple. I have given him the name, Rāmarañjana from Ramjan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> He has renounced his religion of Islam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is there. Yes. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Can you repeat his name, please?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Can you give his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I said, Ramjan, Dr. Ramjan, in Portland University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Also Ātreya Ṛṣi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Ātreya Ṛṣi, yes. He is Iranian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> He is also Muslim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Many Iranians, they have become our devotees. We have got a temple in Tehran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In Hyderabad there is Muslim. He is a life member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that, life member... God consciousness... Who will deny God? It is a science. So we are teaching the science, not the bigotry, "my God, your God." God is one. Gold is gold. Gold does not become Hindu gold, Muslim gold, or Christian gold. Anywhere gold is available, it is gold. That is our definition. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ.</span> That is highest, topmost type of religion, <span class="Italic">yato bhaktir adhokṣaje,</span> where one can learn how to love God, that's all. That is wanted. We are teaching that. There is no question of "this God, that God." God is one. You just practice how to love Him. Then your religion is first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But why give names to Him? Why give names to that God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No name. When I say, <span class="Italic">yato bhaktir adhokṣaje,</span> this is not name. Adhokṣaja means "who is beyond your sense perception."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> It can be Allah, Christ, even Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you must know what is meaning of God. That's all. His name... Just like water. You say, "water," he says, <span class="Italic">pāni,</span> he says, <span class="Italic">autuk</span> (?). So water is water. Similarly, you must know what is God. Name does not matter. But Kṛṣṇa is the perfect name, Kṛṣṇa, according to Sanskrit, all-attractive. The God must be all-attractive; otherwise how He is God? That is the perfect name. Now, if you want to give another name we have no objection. There are hundreds and thousands of names, whatever you like. But it must be God's name. You must understand what is God. Then it is perfect. (aside:) Get on this light. It is scientific. It is not a religious sentiment. Why they should manufacture God? God is God. Gold is gold. And God definition is there in the Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Bhagavān. These are the <span class="Italic">bhagas,</span> opulences. One who possesses all these opulences, He is God, Bhagavān. <span class="Italic">Asty arthe vatup.(?)</span> So all opulences. God is not shortage of opulence. All opulences. All the riches. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is God. He is the proprietor of everything. So unless you accept this formula, how you get conception of God? God is not a proprietor of three <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land. Here is God, <span class="Italic">sarva-loka-maheśvaram.</span> That is God. God is not limited. He is unlimited. I can say I have got <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees, you can say you have got crore of rupees, but God says, "I am the proprietor of all the riches." That we cannot say. That is God's wealth. And because He is the proprietor, He is the enjoyer, supreme enjoyer, <span class="Italic">bhoktā.</span> But we are manufacturing different <span class="Italic">bhoktās;</span> therefore there is controversy. If we accept "God is <span class="Italic">bhoktā;</span> we are simply dependent on Him," then the whole question is solved. The United Nation is the... [break] Yes. God says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He never said, <span class="Italic">māṁsaṁ din māṁ māṁsam.(?)</span> (laughter) If you are God conscious, then you must give. Suppose you are here. If I invite you, then I'll ask you, "Sir, how can I serve you?" If you say, "Give me this kind of food," then that is real service. And you do not like something, and if I say, "Oh, this flesh is very nice. You take it," is that service? God demands this. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati.</span> So we are God's servant. We are giving with these groups of food. And after He's eating, we are taking. We are servant. We cannot say, "My dear master, I like this flesh. You take it." That is not service. So therefore fool has to do everything because God wants it. And if you say, "God is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> He has no mouth, no head, tail," then you can manufacture. But here God says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> In order to establish the <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> will you be spending part of the year here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have got so many centers that if I stay in each center three days, the whole year is finished. What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Swamiji, how many <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> and things you have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 102, big, big <span class="Italic">āśramas.</span> And we are feeding twenty thousand men daily without any income. The God sends. <span class="Italic">Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham [Bg. </span>9.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are spending twelve <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per month in New York and similarly other centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Twelve <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> also in Delhi center only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New York. New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Where do you get these funds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Where do you get these funds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God sends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But he's not sending funds, the god, planning commissioner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he is not devotee. How He'll send? You feed your son, not the outsider.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But God doesn't discriminate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that, general food is there, but special, special mercy, is for the devotee. Just like you have got sympathy for all the children, but you have got special sympathy for your own children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> How many <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> do you have in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India, I have got about six, seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Eight. Eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight. Out of 102, in India I have got only eight. In America we have got forty centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Fifty with the farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Fifty, more than fifty, with the farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Fifty, five zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes, five zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in America. We have got farms like this. They are very successful. They are eating fresh vegetables, fresh grains and milk, and chanting. The temple is there. They have left the city life. So I want to organize that here also. We have already one in Navadvīpa. The devotees are there. They are having their own cloth, own food, own milk, residence, and chanting. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Total membership for around the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Total membership is practically unlimited because we are now getting opposition, so... But actually dedicated life, about ten thousand like these boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> What's going to be the name of this <span class="Italic">āśrama?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already told. It is ISKCON Venkateshvara Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> The name of the trust will be the name of the <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> New Naimiṣāraṇya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> New Naimiṣāraṇya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is secondary, but legal is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> Shall we go now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I'll take them around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Show them. Thank you very much. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Mr. Patel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Did he invite you or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Any idea of the topics?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Some of them, they are a little surprised how I have alone spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world and all the yogis and swamis, they could not rise, combined together. That is his little surprise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Did it surprise Bhave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise why he is inviting me? He could not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> And Swamiji, when you are meeting Bhave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighteenth. Not only him, but there are so many swamis. They are also going but not a single Kṛṣṇa devotee they could turn. That's a fact. For the last two hundred years, that's a fact. You cannot deny the fact. But within ten years we have got so many centers and so many. That is little surprising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> You'll be talking about the cow protection also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Whatever Kṛṣṇa has said. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is giving you. That is our duty. I told these boys, "The cows, whether they give milk or not milk, it doesn't matter. They should be given protection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> They should be given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Given protection. If Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya...</span> He doesn't say only give protection to the milk cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> Once they expire, how do you propose to expose of the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they can eat, those who are eating cows. Just like in our country the <span class="Italic">cāmāras,</span> they take away and take the skin for preparing shoes and eat the flesh and use the bone. So we request those who are flesh eaters, that "Wait up to the natural death. Why you are killing?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> So you support actually government ban of slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> After the cow is dead, if the flesh is taken, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> You have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The vultures, they live on the cow's flesh, so what objection we have got? We don't... We say, "Don't kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> After the natural death, not slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. If they are... Now you can do whatever you like. Our philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> It is only ten-year-old movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> It started in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It started in actually 1967. But the preliminary arrangement was made from 1965. Two years I had spent for making the suitable ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Obviously the first, when you started in the United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> The first <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> And that was in '67.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It was registered in..., by at the end of '66, July, '66, and then it took some time to find out some place. So in '67 I found out some place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> But you don't have an overall budget of all these 102 <span class="Italic">āśramas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have my book trust. The daily collection of book trust is five to six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees. Daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Daily. Oh, book trust. Oh, by the sale of books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. And I have asked them, "Fifty percent, you print books again, and fifty percent, you spend." That's all. Same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Spend on what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spend for this purpose, propagation. That is my mi... And if I would have taken some royalty, then my daily income would have been not less than 75,000 per day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> After income tax, little would be left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no income tax. We are charity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> 75,000 daily, you said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because five to six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> daily collection. If I take minimum fifteen percent, what it comes to? Big, big authors, they get twenty-five percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> But one gentleman... I think in this temple... Some of your books are, rather, prohibiting the cost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this was meant for the outside. Because our countrymen, they are learned, they don't require. They are so learned, they don't require anybody. Therefore it is prohibited. Better they do not take it. Otherwise they will misinterpret. That's all. Their only business is misinterpret. Therefore the prohibited price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> There is something which is difficult to make them understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore better they do not take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> It's easy to go in the virgin soil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they do not understand what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> They want to interpret <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> in their own way. That is the difficulty. Big, big person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Real testing would be only in India in that case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa does not speak for Indians. He is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> The sections of your movement accept in that sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have given up. They have purposefully given up, that "This religion and <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> has killed our nation. Better give it up. Throw it in the water." This is the leaders' plea. Therefore they are changing. They have altogether rejected this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian reporter:</span> No, they don't reject. They give religious freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is freedom? That "Whatever you like, you do."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian reporter:</span> No, not that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then what is freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian reporter:</span> Whichever religion I like, I am free to follow it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This freedom means you can manufacture your own religion. And this is freedom. They want this freedom, that you can manufacture. <span class="Italic">Yato mata tato patha,</span> as the Ramakrishna Mission says, that "You can manufacture your own way of religion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> Somebody said religion is the opium of the masses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they will say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> That is... They trained us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> I think you're right in saying that the government has rejected it, in that sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not know what is religion. That is the difficulty. Religion is here. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> This is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Recently a political party also has alleged that ISKCON temples have become abode of the CIA agents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> What do you say for it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are detecting who is irreligious. That's all. That is our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> They are detecting who is irreligious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is going on in the name of religion, but he does not know what is religion. So that we are detecting. You can say like that. This is our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> It was an allegation by an important...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is allegation. And they are so fools that the Americans, they have come here to become Vaiṣṇava and starvation and they have become religious. They have no food there, and they have come to me and they have no dress, they have... And this boy is English boy. He is giving me massage as if he's a poor man's son. This is... Is he poor man's son? Why he is giving massage? We are Indian, poor Indian. He is not in need of money. He even buys his own cloth. The other day I was chastising him, "Why you are purchasing? You take." "No, I have got money." Just see. This is their position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> May we take leave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes. (Hindi-jokes about CIA) (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> This is wild allegation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is no reason. (Hindi) As if they have no money to go to the hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> In India everything is after CIA now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> Everything is after CIA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in Parliament it has been denied. Rather, Home Member said that "We have no information that they are CIA." Parliament challenged, "What steps you are going to take?" And "No step. There is no information." They are afraid of the American government because of this Bangladesh affair. And otherwise government appreciates this movement. But because the Americans are there they think, "Some may do something," in this way. Yes. But there is no such chance. They are all devotees. They have nothing to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> This is a purely religious movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is right. They have nothing to do with politics. And if they found any politics, they can hang me. I shall go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> I am doctor from Hyderabad, so I wanted to pay my respects to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> I am eye specialist practicing in Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are very qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> With your grace. So I have been thinking of meeting you for a long time, and when I was told you are leaving tomorrow, then I said I would come and pay my respects to you.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> It's our luck that I could meet you. You are a great leader of, religious leader, you see, international. And you belong to order of the Caitanya Maṭha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> It's a great <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> movement. So any services I am prepared to give for the <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> with your...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> I am on telephone also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So any help you want, we'll give. It is very nice. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> I only want that your movement should utilize my services because I believe service to mankind is service to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, service to God is service to mankind. If you pour water in the root, then it is service to the tree. And if you pour water on the leaf, then nobody is served. Everything will be dry, that's all. That is imperfect service. If you have got realization of God, why should you give only human being service? Why not tiger? He is also... Kṛṣṇa says, "They are also My sons." That means you discriminate. That is not that... Father will be satisfied when all the sons are given, not partial, not partial. Suppose I have got five children. If you give service to one children, so I'll ask that "Why not other children?" Naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> Discrimination comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Discrimination comes. So if you have realized God, then you must be learned. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ramachandra:</span> <span class="Italic">Śuni caiva śva-pāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
