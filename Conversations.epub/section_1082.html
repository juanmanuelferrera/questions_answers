<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> "This science of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> I spoke to the sun-god millions of years ago." By the calculation it is forty millions of years ago. Now who will believe that, that Kṛṣṇa spoke this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> forty millions of years ago to the sun-god? Hm? Who will believe that? They'll say mythology. So where is the faith in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and faith in the words of Kṛṣṇa? Understanding Hamlet without Hamlet. (distortion) You cannot make your interpretation that whatever is written there, I take instead of..., I take... (coughing) That is not the way of understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then from the very beginning you'll spoil it. Then what is the meaning of preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> If you do not accept the direction of the author, then what right you have got to say that you have understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (Indian man):</span> Could it be that there may be different interpretations?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible. That is not the process. You cannot interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you want to preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you must preach what Kṛṣṇa has said. If you have got a different philosophy, you can say differently. You don't cheat people that you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and interpret in your own way and cheat others and be cheated yourself. You cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, for example, Tilak Maharaj...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tilak may be, Gandhi may be, whoever may be. But the point is that you have to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> according to the direction of the author. Because you are Mr. Tilak or Mr. Gandhi, you can do everything on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No no, that is not the idea. But there are different type <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now how you have got a different types of... Just like the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> So <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre,</span> how you can interpret in a different way? Kurukṣetra is already there. But how you can interpret, "Kurukṣetra means this, Kurukṣetra means that?" You cannot interpret.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, but who is decided what exactly the meaning...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Exactly the meaning is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Literal, literally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Literally, yes. The thing is the interpretation is required when you cannot understand. If, if I say, "This is a stick," everyone knows it is a stick. So I say, "Here is a stick." So if you say, "No, I do not accept it is stick." So what is that interpretation? Everyone knows it is stick. Similarly, Kurukṣetra means that the place, still existing. And in the Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is ordered, <span class="Italic">kurukṣetre dharma yajayet.</span> You go... From time immemorial it is a place of pilgrimage. Even Kṛṣṇa, during solar eclipse, Kṛṣṇa with His family, He came there, Jagannātha. The ceremony is there, Ratha-yātrā. Because Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and Subhadra came in the same chariot. That is being performed. So Kurukṣetra, <span class="Italic">dharmakṣetra,</span> at least five thousand years ago the system was that people used to come to Kurukṣetra as a place of pilgrimage, <span class="Italic">dharmakṣetra.</span> And Kurukṣetra, the place is there. And the the two family members, the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas, they fought. The Battle of Kurukṣetra took place. These things are evident. Then why there is need of interpreting? That is the first point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Those points are very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every point is very clear. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> every point is very clear, unless you interpret it in the wrong way. ("Kṛṣṇa Meditations" is recorded on this tape also, making it indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how it can be called? If you interpret in your own way, interpret in your own way, interpretation, then where is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Best thing is that take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Then there will be (indistinct). Why you should interpret? You have no right to interpret on the words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But Swamiji, you have also given so much (indistinct). That is interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not interpretation. That is explanation. Interpretation, if I change Kurukṣetra into something else, that is interpretation. That is wisdom. That is wisdom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say instead of collecting so many hundreds and thousands of literature on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> why not take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is? What is the difficulty? Kurukṣetra is this position is fact. <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata, Mahābhārata</span> means greater India. And that is, it is <span class="Italic">itihasa.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">itihāsa. Itihāsa,</span> if you don't believe that there was a battle in the Kurukṣetra... But that is the fact. It is the history. Then how you can finish (?) <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-Gītā?</span> Every point of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is clear. It is clear. There is no need of interpretation. That is the first thing. If you interpret you spoil the whole thing. Because interpretation is required when the things are not clear. If everything is clear, why should you interpret?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, it is explanation I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Explanation, you cannot explain that Kurukṣetra means this, <span class="Italic">dharmakṣetra</span> means this, Pāṇḍava means this. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take Sanskrit. Take Sanskrit. <span class="Italic">Dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre.</span> do not interpret to any other language. Take Sanskrit. Kurukṣetra is clear, <span class="Italic">dharmakṣetra</span> is clear, Pāṇḍava is clear. Then why should we interpret? Why not take the particular verse. Everything, when there is a (indistinct), then please do not try to cut, or (indistinct) your (indistinct). If there is... (indistinct) ...but by translating the whole thing you mistake then what is the use of such translation? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then you first of all learn Sanskrit, then you (indistinct). If there is (indistinct). This practice should be stopped. If you want to preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and if you want to preach your own philosophy through <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> don't do this preaching. You preach your philosophy, your (indistinct). You can preach any philosophy you like, but don't take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and (indistinct) on it. (?) That is my (indistinct). That is being done. That is being done. So therefore, instead of studying, collecting so many literatures, why not take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is and preach? And as evidence to prove he is (indistinct) ...all over the world. Before me for 200 years there was preaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Not a single person became... It is the history of (indistinct). Now you see thousands. Why? Because there is no interpretation. There is no interpretation. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the Supreme." <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are presenting, "Here is God." You are searching after God, Kṛṣṇa, and they are accepting. They do not (indistinct), what is Kṛṣṇa. What is this? How they are accepting? Because it is the real thing, there is no interpretation. They are not Hindus, they are not born in India. How they have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness? They have given up bad habits, no illicit sex. Because you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa unless you are free from all sinful activities. Anyone who is sinful, he cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> We test him. We test like this, that Kṛṣṇa says this, that anyone who does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord, he is under the four groups: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍhāḥ, narādhamāḥ, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> That's it. We are fools and rascals, we have no such education. But we take Kṛṣṇa's word that "Here is a fool, here is a sinful man, here is a <span class="Italic">narādhamāḥ,</span> here is <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta.</span>" So unless you stick to this point, that we shall preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (indistinct) then there is no meaning of it. You are misled, you will mislead others. But if you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, as Kṛṣṇa said, then... If you are not prepared to do that, then however (indistinct) interpretation, thousands of literatures, the result is (indistinct). This is practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no reason then why there are so many interpretations of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi back and forth)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many (indistinct), that's all right, But if you want to preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you have to do like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> (Yelling)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (angry) I don't say Caitanya, I say Kṛṣṇa. Why you misunderstand? Don't talk like that. I don't say that. Why you have misunderstood? Don't disturb in that... I don't say Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Why you are bringing Caitanya? You are saying. I say what Kṛṣṇa says, you do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you shall go to so many leaders? Why not go to the supreme leader, Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you explain, that is another... But interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is the basic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already there. What Kṛṣṇa says, you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, that is all right. Not to go further. As an organization we want to know your views on those points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what is the first point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadisa:</span> "To collect all available materials and survey all institutions in India and abroad who are doing work based on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> so that we will have completely up to date library."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I say what is the need of collecting? What <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> For information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Information... <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> take information from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> What others have said you have nothing to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Now for example, we should have literature on <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there will be no limit. There are so many, 600,000 interpretations. Then your life will be spend (indistinct) for collecting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If I want to go to Bombay, I must have the correct timetable. Not a false timetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say, what Kṛṣṇa directs, <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Paramparā</span> means to hear the truth from the spiritual master. You take this. Kṛṣṇa... Arjuna accepted, when he was puzzled whether to fight or not to fight, he accepted Kṛṣṇa as guru. <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'ham.</span> "Now I don't want to talk or argue with You," because as soon as you become a <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> you have to accept the statement of the guru. That is the relationship between guru and <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> You cannot talk with guru from the same level. Whatever guru says you have to accept. Otherwise don't accept guru. Don't make a fashion of taking guru just like you keep a dog. Guru, first of all you have to select. <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to select such a person where you can fully surrender. So Kṛṣṇa is accepted by Arjuna like that. <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all. "I have surrendered to you." This is the first instance (instruction?). That means whatever He says, and at last He says, <span class="Italic">sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yad vadasi</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is... Not that you make cut cut.(?) That is the process. Here is the <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> Kṛṣṇa is speaking Arjuna and Arjuna is accepting, <span class="Italic">sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yad vadasi</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is... Not that you make cut-cut (?). "Whatever You have said." <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> "You have said that You are the Supreme, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma.</span> I accept it." This is <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> So we have not seen Kṛṣṇa talking, but the words are there. So Arjuna has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma.</span> How we have change of, "Kṛṣṇa is..."? So first of all we have to accept by the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. <span class="Italic">Sa kāleneha yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> That <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> is now gone, Kṛṣṇa says, therefore I am speaking to you again age-old-system. Not that new. <span class="Italic">Purāṇa.</span> And now you take. How Arjuna is accepting? Arjuna said, <span class="Italic">sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) That is not <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> understanding. You take <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system, you try to understand Kṛṣṇa as Arjuna has understood. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise it is (indistinct). There is no meaning. But if anyone has accepted the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system as Arjuna has understood then he can speak on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Otherwise he has no right to speak anything. That is <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But All India conference, it is not for mass understanding. Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ. Śreṣṭhaḥ</span> means the leaders of society. <span class="Italic">Rājarṣayo.</span> Not ordinary persons. <span class="Italic">Rāja,</span> he must be just like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Lord Rāmacandra, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. They are <span class="Italic">rājarṣi.</span> They are saintly persons, but they are governor. Such persons should understand. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ tad tad evetaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha</span> person understands <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is not for the mass of people. Because</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">You cannot make a mass meeting and pass resolution and you'll understand Kṛṣṇa. It is not like that. Workers must be also very <span class="Italic">śreṣṭhas,</span> not ordinary workers. He must understand Kṛṣṇa. Then he can... It is not foolish, what kind of (indistinct). So if you want to prove <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> find out the <span class="Italic">śreṣṭhas</span> of the country, sit down. Not that at mass conference-you bring meeting (?) And preaching. Select! If you understand then you can preach. But if you do not understand what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> how to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> what is Kṛṣṇa... And Kṛṣṇa says that</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So to understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy job. First of all one has to become <span class="Italic">siddha.</span> And not only you become <span class="Italic">siddha, yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3],</span> even one is <span class="Italic">siddha</span> it is very difficult for him to understand-<span class="Italic">tattvataḥ.</span> What Kṛṣṇa means, to understand, it is not so easy job. And again He said, He explains that <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> Only the devotees can understand. It is not the business of the <span class="Italic">karmīs, jñānīs,</span> yogis. He has strictly specified-<span class="Italic">bhaktyā. Bhakto 'si priyo 'si.</span> When He wanted to instruct Arjuna... Arjuna was a householder, a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> not even a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> not a Vedantist. The question may be why He selected Arjuna to preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> which is so (indistinct) and (indistinct). That Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si.</span> "Without being <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> nobody can understand Me." And again He confirms, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> If we interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in a different way, <span class="Italic">karma, jñāna,</span> yoga, you'll never get Kṛṣṇa. So these things are there. So to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> one has to become a devotee, pure devotee. Not because he's learned scholar, he's a big politician or a big yogi or big <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> Because He plainly says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ,</span> what He is, then it is natural he'll interpret in his way, his own philosophy. That is not (indistinct). If you take <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> yoga, <span class="Italic">karma,</span> or other.... But it is not possible. You have to receive it through the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. The <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system is clear. As Arjuna understood, you have to take it. And if you preach, that will be effective. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you say my idea then I become one of you. (laughter) So I don't want that. I say I am foolish man. I have no idea. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, that is idea. Just like a child, he speaks the words of the father. If the father... The child asks,"Father, what is this?" The father says, "This is a stick." So if the child says, "That is a stick," so that is correct. He may be a child. Because he repeats the words of the father... (Hindi) If the people are fools and rascals, then other will be fool and rascal. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) If you accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme then where is the question of interpretation? (Hindi conversation) But who accepted? This is a fact. You try to understand that before me for 200 years so many swamis, yogis were there. Not a single man became Kṛṣṇa conscious. (Hindi conversation) He is not teacher he is cheater. Why should you change Kṛṣṇa's words? That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span><i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> Don't manufacture. What Kṛṣṇa has said, you say. Just as a child he can say, "This is a stick." "How you have learned?" "Father said." That's all. (Hindi) I started this business with forty rupees. (laughter) (Hindi) Yes when I went to New York they allowed me only forty rupees. (Hindi to end)</div>
