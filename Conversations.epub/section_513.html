<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Reporter<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>March 9, 1975, London</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...he did not like to kill his cousin-brother. He said that "Even they usurp my kingdom, I do not wish to kill them." So this affection, this bodily affection, was not very much approved by Kṛṣṇa. He said that "You are talking like a non-Āryan." <span class="Italic">Anārya-juṣṭam. Anārya.</span> "The Āryan, they do not think like that." Another place He says that "You are giving consideration on the body, but any learned man does not refer to body, either dead or alive. They, learned man, will give stress on the moving force of the body." So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means basically on the moving force of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> The moving force of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of the body. Just like you are moving, I am moving. As soon as the moving force, whatever it is, is gone, then your body is a lump of matter, my body is a lump of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Have you had any difficulty in bringing this, which seems to have originated in India, into the West?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Have we found any problems or difficulty is bringing this teaching, which appears to have originated in India, to the West? Have we found any problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there cannot be any problem. Just like I am speaking to you. If you are sane man, you will have to admit this. The mistake you will have to admit, if you are a sane man. If you are something else, then you will not admit the mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Uh huh. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the mistake is... You are talking with me; I am talking with you. Your body is there, my body. But which is important? Your body is important, or the force which is talking, that is important? Which is important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> The force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. So who is giving? Where is the educational institution to give lesson about this living force? Is there any education all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But you don't find that the fact that your monks are wearing robes or shaving their heads is a difficulty in the West, where not many people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of East and West. It is the question of human life. There is no question... The Western people also have this living force, and Eastern people also have this living force. So where is the difference, West and East? There is no question of West and East. It is the problem for the whole human society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Can you tell me how your teaching relates to the Bible, to the Christian teaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christian teaching is good. It is giving idea of God. But who is following Christian teaching? That is the problem. Nobody is following. Christ says, "Thou shall not kill," and the Christian people are very expert in killing. Do you admit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Then who is a Christian? If one does not follow the instruction of Christ, then would you call him a Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That is the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporte:</span> Is there any reason why you teach your followers the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> rather than the Bible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The teaching is the same. The teaching is the same. What Lord Jesus Christ taught and what we are... (aside:) <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> The teaching is the same. But who is following? That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I see. So you don't think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficulty has arisen-I am claiming to be Hindu, but I am not following the Vedic rules. You are claiming to be Christian, but you are not following the Christian rules. This is going on all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But if someone was making the Bible a sort of reality in their lives...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is good. What is the wrong there, Bible? It is everything all right. We don't say "The Bible is bad, and <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are good." We don't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Are you yourself or do your followers regard you as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa or as the teacher of His teachings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We regard ourself as servant of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Servant of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> There are a lot of other spiritual groups in the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is servant of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Are you saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone. You are also servant of Kṛṣṇa. Are you not servant of Kṛṣṇa? Are you master? You are not servant of anyone? Are you? You have come as press representative. You are servant of the press. So you are not master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But I wanted to ask about other spiritual groups in this country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So any spiritual... If he actually belongs to the spiritual understand, then he must admit that he is servant of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Servant of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real spiritual understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But many different groups give the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not... They have no spiritual understanding. Anyone who says something else beyond this understanding, that every living entity is servant of God, if he says something else, he does not know what is spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But there seem to be a lot of groups that are saying that, but teaching a different way to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different way... There cannot be dif... The way is one. God is one, and we all living entities, we are dependent on God's mercy. Therefore we are servant. Everyone is servant. We say that, that God is one, and every one of us, we are all servant of God. So let us engage in our original position as servant of God. This is our teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Do you feel that... In other groups also there are sort of teachers or masters or whatever they call them. Do you feel that there can be more than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are wasting time simply and cheating others. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">They</span> are wasting time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they do not understand what is their position; therefore their teaching is simply waste of time. This is the position: that God is great, and we are all dependent on God. Who will deny this? This is the original principle. Now, in one religious system it may be taught in a little different way. In another religious system it may be... But if there is no such sense that "God is the supreme, and we are all subordinate servant..." This should be the basic idea. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo<br class="calibre2"/>yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>ahaituky apratihatā<br class="calibre2"/>yayātmā suprasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He says that "That is first-class religion which teaches the followers how to become obedient to God." It doesn't matter whether it's Christian religion or Hindu religion or Muslim religion. If they are teaching this fact, that... Actually they are doing that. Muslim they say, <span class="Italic">allah akbar.</span> Christian people say, "God is great," and the Hindus also say, <span class="Italic">eko brahma dvitīya nāsti.</span> So you go... Just the same teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You're not actually saying that you're the only teacher who can give this teaching, but that any teacher who gives this teaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the principle. Just like two plus two equal to four. So anyone who teaches this, he is a teacher. And if a rascal says two plus two equal to three, then he is not a teacher; he is a cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> So are you saying in fact that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is... I am saying, what I am saying to you, that "God is great, and everyone is servant." Can you deny this? Can you deny this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What is the difficulty? Nobody, no sane man, will deny it.</div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">And Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So these things are there. God is great, we are all subordinate, and we are maintained. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> This is the Vedic information. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> So this principle should be broadcast. People should know what is his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is the teacher always necessary? I mean, many meditation groups or yoga groups say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why you are asking? Anything you want to learn, you must go to a teacher. How you can learn independently?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I mean just, say, by reading the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is also taking lesson from the teacher. Teacher-Kṛṣṇa is personally the teacher, and you read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> means you take lessons from teacher, the supreme teacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I read a news report recently that you had said in Paris that you no longer taught your followers to chant simply the name of, the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> because the name of God could be chanted in any form. Is that so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Chanting of the holy name... We are broadcasting that you, in this age, you begin for God realization. Chant His holy name. Very simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> So this holy name can be in different forms for a Christian or a Hindu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different form means that the... Just like water. Water, somebody says, "Water," and India, somebody says, <span class="Italic">jal,</span> or <span class="Italic">pani,</span> but the substance is the same. If your name means the same thing, then it is right. And if your name suggests something else, then it is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And is there something that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you have got some name which actually refers to God, then it is all right. But if you have got something, name, which refers to dog, then it is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is this something that your followers can be aware of constantly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are recommending to chant the name of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. So God is all-attractive. Otherwise how He can be God? God cannot be attractive for you and not for me. This is very accurate word. God has no name. That's a fact. But we coin His name according to His dealings. Just like we call God Yaśodā-nandana. So God came as the son of Yaśodā. Therefore we call Him Yaśodā-nandana, son of Yaśodā. So you can take it as name. Similarly, God's name the total summarization-"all-attractive." That is perfect name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is this the same name that is spoken of in the Bible where it says "the word of God"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> In the Bible it says "the word of God." Is that the same name that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, word is God. Kṛṣṇa is God. If you use this word Kṛṣṇa-because God is all-attractive-then immediately you associate with God. And if you associate with God, then you become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Can you explain what I read in one of your books, that the sound spoken either in chanting a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> or when talking about God or Kṛṣṇa is somehow transcendental sound, though it's spoken with the same voice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is Absolute. His name and His person, not different, because He is Absolute. Here in the material world the name is not the substance. If I want water... I am thirsty, and if I chant "Water, water, water, water," that will not help me. But in the spiritual world, God being Absolute, you chant God's name, you see God's form, you discuss about God's activities, they are all the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> So how, if when we chant "Water, water, water," we don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material word. If you chant "Water, water," the real water will not come. But if you chant "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," then because it is absolute, then you are associating with Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Then we've, we come into the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, immediately. Because Kṛṣṇa is on your tongue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But how do we feel that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will feel. Go on chanting. Just like if you drink water, then you will feel that "My thirsty... thirstiness is gone."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Oh. But it's the same body doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if you chant "Kṛṣṇa," then you will be spiritually realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> That's all the questions I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is very important movement. Try to understand and broadcast it. It is not a sectarian, so-called religious movement. It is a scientific movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You mean this movement in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And all our books, they are very nicely being accepted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah, I have some of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...by high-class professors, universities, libraries. They are all accepting. You will be surprised to know that we are selling books, according to our Indian currency, twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per month. Out of that, we are spending eight to ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> for all our centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You have centers all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, all over the world. In Europe we have got so many centers. Here in London we have got two centers. Similarly, Paris, Germany, four centers. Then Sweden, one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Sweden and Denmark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Denmark, Holland, and Rome, then Switzerland, Geneva. So we have got several branches here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Are many people joining you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Just see, many people here. Each center we have got not less than fifty men, up to 250. Similarly, we have got in Australia and New Zealand, all over the world. In India we have got six. In India I have got six. In Vṛndāvana, Calcutta, Bombay, Navadvīpa, Hyderabad-in so many places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is the work you recommend your followers to do purely spiritual, or do you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This we simply say, that "God is great. You are servant. Don't be befooled that you are God. Don't be befooled like that." That is our program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Do they do anything like social work or other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, social work, this is the best social work. People are in ignorance, and we are giving them knowledge. Is it not the best social work? If you keep the man in ignorance and if you give him something... Just like your child. You simply give him to eat but no education. Then what is the benefit? Is that very good nice work, that you give your children nice food to become robust but no education? Is that very good nice work? People are, in this human form of life, especially meant for understanding God. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> So they are keeping them in darkness and teaching them technology, how to make cycle. That's all. The life is meant for understanding God, and they have been educated for making cycle and sewing machine. This is going on. Therefore there will be disaster. It is already there. Just like in America or any Western country, they have manufactured so many cars, and now they are flattering the Arabians, "Please give us oil." You see? Power crisis. And if they stop manufacturing, there is unemployment. And if they increase car, there is power shortage. So this dilemma, this modern civilization will have to meet this dilemma because they are going against the laws of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You are not suggesting that all of that is just cut away completely, but that people...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you require... First thing, you require to eat. So Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Produce sufficient grain, food grain, so that both the animal and the man, they will eat and become robust, stout, and strong. And they will be capable of working. So that is the first thing. But who is producing food grains? They are producing motor tires. When there is scarcity of food, will these motor tires help us? We shall eat motor tires? This is going on, so-called industrialization, producing unnecessary thing which is not required, and they are neglecting producing food grains. And I have estimated-I am traveling all over the world-that there are so much space even now that if you produce food grain, you can feed ten times of the population as it is. But they will not do that. They will create motorcars, and the whole street is congested. At any moment there can be accident, and if you have to go to consult a doctor, you have to go thirty miles off. Because the motorcar is there. I am diseased. I want to consult a doctor. So he must be in neighborhood. But I have to go thirty miles. And maybe, before going to the doctor, I may be finished, by accident. <span class="Italic">Anartha,</span> it is called <span class="Italic">anartha. Anartha</span> means unwanted things. So <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says,</div>
<div class="Verse">anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>lokasyājānato vidvāṁś<br class="calibre2"/>cakre sātvata-saṁhitām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.7.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Because the rascals are simply creating unnecessary necessities of life, so their only remedy is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.</span> But people do not know it. Therefore <span class="Italic">vidvān,</span> Vyāsadeva, he has made the <span class="Italic">sātvata-saṁhitā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, anartha upaśamam,</span> to stop them acting nonsensically, simply producing problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> So it's just a question of when.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The book is there. You learn, and you be learned. It is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Do you foresee a time coming when people will realize...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has already come, disaster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No, I mean a time coming when disaster is averted and people realize...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, unless you take the real instruction, how you can stop disaster? You must agree to take the real instruction. If you don't agree, then you suffer. That is your business. But the remedy is there. The instruction is there. Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, "Produce food grain." The remedy is there. But you will not produce food grain; you will produce motorcar. Then you must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But do you foresee a time when many people will receive that remedy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know, but the remedy is there. If you like, you can take it. If a man is suffering from some disease, the remedy is there, the physician is there, but if he does not take advantage, then that is his business. What can be done? This is very nice... Every <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> every line is so important.</div>
<div class="Verse">anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>lokasyājānato vidvāṁś<br class="calibre2"/>cakre sātvata-saṁhitām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.7.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Those who are high-grade personalities, they are always thinking, "How these rascals will be happy?" Their only business is that. But their instruction is not being accepted. That is the difficulty. They have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Mūḍha.</span> This word, <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> means rascals. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamaḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> The lowest of the mankind, miscreants and rascals, these class of men will not accept God as the supreme. But He is... Kṛṣṇa is speaking, "Rascal." One may protest that "There are so many educated men. They are all rascals?" But that is also confirmed: "Yes, they are rascals." Why? <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> "Their real knowledge has been taken away by the illusory energy." <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> Why it is done? <span class="Italic">Āsuri bhāvam āśritāḥ:</span> "Because they have accepted this theory 'There is no God.' " That is the difficulty. <span class="Italic">Āsuri bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> They are under the control. How you can say there is no God? Are you free? Are you independent? What do you think? Are you independent of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I guess we're not independent of our death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You want to be independent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He says that "I guess we are not independent of our death."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Very... Thank you. (laughter) That is intelligence. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> Those who are not accepting God in lifetime, they will meet God, death. Death is another form of God. That they cannot deny. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. He simply defied God, and Nṛsiṁhadeva came, finished everything within a second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is this something where we can sort of experience death while we are still alive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alive, we have been given chance to understand God. But if you don't understand, then next life you become a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> A dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Why a dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? (laughter) Suppose if God says that "You become a dog," can you check it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is there any way I can prepare...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that you can if you surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> If I...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you can check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And the only way to surrender is to accept this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise there is no certainty. You can become demigod also. You can become higher planetary... But you have to change your body. Either you become dog or you can become demigod, but change your body, that is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You mean it always comes back as some form of animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Whether you always return as an animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not always. There are 8,400,000 forms of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> A hundred thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to accept one of them. That is according to your quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> The quality of my life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like if you infect a certain type of disease, you must suffer from that disease. Similarly, there are three qualities of the material nature. So as you associate with that quality, you get a similar body. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> How one is getting better life, one is getting worse life, the reason is associating, infecting the different types of modes of nature. That education we have no... There is no such education, what kind of association we should make so that we can better life or we can go back to home, back to God. There is no such education. They are living like cats and dogs and going to be cats and dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Do I understand that the children in your school in Texas, that they're brought up in what you consider spiritual consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Will they be virtually living outside...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Outside also you can live. Simply you must know how to live. At the present moment you do not know how to live. That's all. And there is no education how to live. All of us being sent to the slaughterhouse, that's all. They do not know how to live. In the Vedic civilization you will find the first proposition is how to live. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> How to live... First the human society is divided into four: the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> the <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> or the <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> The first-class intelligent man, they are educated as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa</span> means <span class="Italic">satya śama dama titikṣa ārjava, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like we are training engineer, similarly, a class of men, those who are very intelligent, they should be trained up as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> They should be trained up how to speak truth any circumstance. Even to the enemy he will speak truth. This requires training, not that foolishly, a cats' and dogs' life. What is the value of this life? The modern civilization, they do not know how to live. They are simply interested in eating, and that's also any nonsense eating. But according to Vedic civilization, "This eating is first class. This eating is second class. This eating is third class. This eating is fourth class." So many things required to correct the mistaken way of civilization. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And is the correct way of living merely a way of doing, actually, a sort of higher state of consciousness where you're experiencing something different to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Experience, why? If we live in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, why shall we experience differently? There is no question of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You're not experiencing differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like we are teaching these boys how to live, Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then... (to devotees:) What is our program, just explain. What is our program in the temple from the early in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Rising at 3:30, take bath, then go to the temple for <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and lecture. Then chant our rounds, take breakfast, and then do duties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> What time do you take breakfast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> 8:00, 8:30. So before taking breakfast, we are already awake four hours. Most people sleep till eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And then through the day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Through the day we're engaged. Some people are typing; some people are painting; some people are preaching; some people are printing books. We do everything, because this society is complete. As Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you do as work, whatever you eat, whatever you give away, everything should be done as an offering unto Me. By this principle of work you are freed from all sinful reaction and you come to Me." So the goal of life, or the goal of this society, or human society, should be to go back home, back to Godhead, back to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are going to have the next body. That's a fact. So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that how you can have the next body.</div>
<div class="Verse">yānti deva-vratā devān<br class="calibre2"/>pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.25]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"So you can go to the higher planetary system. Prepare yourself in that way. You can go to the <span class="Italic">pitṛloka.</span> You can remain within this world. And you can come to Me also." So if I have to prepare myself for the next life, why not go back to home, back to Godhead? Why unnecessarily go to the other planets or to the dogs and cats? Prepare in such a way that <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> No more material body. You go back to home, back... That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the best. After all, you have to prepare yourself for the next body. So why not prepare yourself for the next body as good as Kṛṣṇa's? <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is very intelligent movement. Any intelligent man should take it very seriously. If I have to prepare for my next life, why not prepare next life-just we are talking with you, you can go and talk with Kṛṣṇa. You can dance with Kṛṣṇa. You can eat with Kṛṣṇa. You can play with Kṛṣṇa. If there is such possibility, why should we waste our time in different way? That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. After all, we are going to die. And <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> You have to accept another body, just you have already accepted. <span class="Italic">Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.</span> We have accepted a different body. I was a child. Now I have got different body. So we are accepting different body. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Similarly, you accept another body after death. Now what that body should be, everything is there.</div>
<div class="Verse">ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>14.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If you associate, infect tamasic, ignorance, then you go down and down, become animal. And if you associate with goodness, then you go higher planetary system, even up to God. And if you infect <span class="Italic">rājo-guṇa,</span> passion, then you remain here. Everything is there. Simply we have to accept and do it nicely. Then our life is successful. That we are teaching. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So you have no other question? Finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah, I've run out of questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All questions are answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> thoroughly, and you will get all answer, all problems solved. Unfortunately, the so-called politicians and scholars, they misinterpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and ruin their career and misguide others. That is going on. All rascals are doing that. "This word means this," as if Kṛṣṇa left this word to be explained by a rascal. This is going on. He does not think of his position, that at any moment he will be kicked out of this platform of so-called leadership, so-called educated teacher, and he is commenting on the words of Kṛṣṇa. This is going on. He does not understand his position, that "What I am?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> How does Kṛṣṇa consciousness relate to the Hindu religion? Because that is also based on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is not meant for the Hindus, but Kṛṣṇa appeared in Hindustan. Therefore it is the duty of all Hindus to know Kṛṣṇa first. And they also conscious. Every Hindu knows Kṛṣṇa. Every Hindu observes the Janmāṣṭamī, Kṛṣṇa's birthday. But they are not very serious to understand Kṛṣṇa as a follower. Just like Christian. They admit they are Christian but don't follow the Christian principles. So that Hindus are also like that. Nobody is following Kṛṣṇa's instruction. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am God." <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "There is no more superior person or superior position than Me," Kṛṣṇa says. And "God" means that. In the dictionary "God" means the Supreme Being. Supreme Being means nobody is greater than Him; nobody is equal to Him. That is called supreme. So here God personally says that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> But this rascal will not accept. They will say, "No, here is another <span class="Italic">dini-kṛṣṇa.</span>" They will bring one competitor. That is going on. "God" means there cannot be any competitor. Nobody is equal to Him; nobody is greater than Him. But they will bring so many competitors. "Why Kṛṣṇa alone will be God?" This is the position of the modern Hindus. They have lost their own culture, and they wanted to imitate Western culture. That they could not do, neither they could maintain their own culture. Therefore in the wilderness, very precarious condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> So thanks very much indeed for talking to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Give him some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> This is Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you. (guest leaves) Did you take any information of that land? You wanted to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, we didn't get a chance today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they said there were some life members here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. Brahmānanda(?) has brought them here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> (end)</div>
