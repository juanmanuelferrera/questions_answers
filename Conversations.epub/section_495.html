<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the topmost yogi, Yogeśvara. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Cortez:</span> (Spanish) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He said he has studied all of Western philosophy, he's not that familiar with Eastern philosophy, and his present interest is in the philosophy of anthropology. He's interested in studying man, his body, also the spirit, how man can transcend his body, and that he has come here because he wants to learn something about the philosophy of the East.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this girl is psychologist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychologist (Lady):</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> She works in an institute of psychology, and she is particularly studying human conduct, why people act the way they do, and she's also interested in learning something about our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have studied about the subtle body of living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychologist:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, this, this gross body made of five material elements-earth, water, air, fire, like that. This we can see with our eyes, but we cannot see the mind, intelligence and ego. Although everyone knows there is mind, there is intelligence. So when this body is annihilated, the subtle body-mind, intelligence, ego-carries the soul to another gross body. This is the process of transmigration of the soul. Now, what do you think of this process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychologist:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> She says in her... In the field of psychology also they admit also, they admit the existence of forces beyond the gross elements, and although ordinarily they do not deal with that, she is very interested to know about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the law. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, "The soul is not annihilated after the destruction of the body." You find out that verse, <span class="Italic">na jāyate na mriyate va kadacit.</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin<br class="calibre2"/>nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇo<br class="calibre2"/>na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.20]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the soul transmigrates to another body. That is the evolutionary process for anthropology, basic principle of anthropology. So in Darwin's theory there is no admission of the soul. Therefore it is imperfect. The soul transmigrates from one type of body to another type. And then there are 8,400,000 forms of body. So when we get this human form of body we get all intelligence. And we should utilize this intelligence how to stop this transmigration of the soul from one body to another. So what is your opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Cortez:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> (translating) If there's a certain criteria of proof or a certain evidence that we can know for certain that there actually is such transmigration of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like the baby is, the soul is, transmigrated from baby's body to child's body, child's body to boy's body, boy's body to youthful body, so the body vanishes, and because the soul remains, he gets another body. Now I am old man. I remember I had a child's body, I was lying down. I quite remember it. But that body is not existing. So this is the example. Everyone has experience. This is transmigration of the soul from one body to another. And at the time of death, the psychological condition of the mind will carry me to a suitable body, and I shall enter into the womb of my mother through the semina of the father, and the mother will give that a particular type of body, and when it is completely manufactured, then I come out and begin my again. Therefore we find varieties of forms, but in each and every form there is the soul. Now, in the human form of life, we should utilize our intelligence that "This constant change of body, how it can be stopped?" And we should remain in our eternal body because I am eternal, but psychologically I am simply changing different forms of body, and at the time of change of body I have to undergo so many sufferings. To remain within the womb of the mother for ten months in packed up condition, it is a very terrible punishment. But for each new birth, we have to undertake this terrible suffering. Sometimes nowadays they're being killed. So to avoid all these dangers, one should try to remain in his spiritual body so that there will be no more chance of accepting material...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> (reads Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychologist:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> She wants to know what disciplines we have, what practices we have. Also she had a misunderstanding. She said "for the beginners," so I was explaining it was the same for the beginners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The main principle is, to understand spiritual subject matter, one must be sinless. You find that verse,</div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">[break] ...ess, more we can understand spiritual matters. Therefore among our students, the four principles... [break] Explain. Yes, are prohibited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Cortez:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He says if to be sinless is not something more profound than simply restricting the body from some things, if there's not a more profound aspect of sinlessness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body is consider... Just like if you have got high fever, you cannot act your brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You cannot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Act your brain. Similarly, this is also like fever, sinful fever, so you cannot act your brain for understanding higher spiritual matters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Cortez:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He's saying, "What is sin, then?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That sin you have explained. These are the four principles of sinful life. This can be avoided. Just like these European, American boys. They were also addicted to these sinful activities, but now they have given up, and they are understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness very nicely. Material life means sinful life. Therefore we have to act materially under regulation. Just like a man suffering from some disease, he has to live under the direction of the physician. Otherwise his sufferings will continue. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Cortez:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I'm going to translate piece by piece so I can tell you exactly what he's saying. He's saying that he understands perfectly well that a human being should look for a way for self-control and to control the physical force within him, but there's also another dimension in the human being which is a social dimension which also has to be taken care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the social dimension is described, <span class="Italic">cātur varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. You read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tasya kartāram api māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viddhy akartāram avyayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Social platform, there must be four classes of men, divisions. Just like this body is divided into four departments-the brain, the arm, the belly and the leg-so the society should be divided into four divisions: the brain division, the arm division, the belly division, and the leg division. Leg division means ordinary worker. And all of them should cooperate for keeping the body fit. If this system is followed, then the whole human society will be working very nicely. At the present moment there is no brain; therefore everything is chaotic. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is creating some brain. If they follow, the whole society will be happy. A man may be very stout and strong, but if he has no good brain, it is useless. Similarly, at the present moment there is education, there is money and everything, but because there is no brain, the whole thing is in chaotic condition. The first defect is, in education, that the present leader, he does not know what is the aim of life. Neither the people know that there is reincarnation or transmigration of the soul after death. They do not know. So basically they are brainless. So they cannot give guidance, and therefore the whole society is in chaotic condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychologist:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> If our chanting is a form of prayer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Chanting is a spiritual method for cleansing our heart. Because all dirty things are there in the heart, if the heart becomes clean, then we can understand things as they are. The first misunderstanding, that everyone is thinking that he is this body, this is due to ignorance. So when one is cleansed he can understand that he is not this body; he is separate from the body; he lives within this body. Therefore when the person leaves this body it is dead lump of matter. So people are giving more importance to the lump of matter than to the real person within the body. Just like a bird is within the cage, the cage is being washed very nicely and no food to the bird. Therefore the bird is in disturbed condition, and he's crying, "Khan, khan, khan, khan." This is going on. They're giving stress on the cage, not the bird within the cage. Neither do they know that the living being is within this material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychologist:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Can someone achieve self-realization without a guru or does he need a guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you think like that? Is there anything within this you world which can be learned without guru? Even if you become an ordinary carpenter, you have to learn from an expert carpenter. So how you can imagine to learn the topmost subject matter without guru? This is... The Vedic injunction is, therefore, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">, samit-pāṇiḥ,</span> like that. We must have a bona fide guru to train us in the understanding of spiritual matter. Guru means who knows the thing, who can teach you. That is guru, not a humbug guru, but guru means one who knows. <span class="Italic">Tattva-darśinaḥ,</span> one who has seen the truth, he can become guru. Find this verse,</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti tad-jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> (Spanish) Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have to go, bathroom. Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> (end)</div>
