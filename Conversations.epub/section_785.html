<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> There are more, probably at least a hundred thousand, and at least, maybe 300,000 their home was destroyed. Small country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In my zone there are many countries that are always being hit by earthquakes, tidal waves, floods, repeatedly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So what is to be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We'll go afterwards and preach there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We will go afterwards and preach there. There is another country right next to it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tell them that if you take to Hare Kṛṣṇa, then these things will not happen. Tell them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. In Caracas, where you visited, less then ten years ago there was a big earthquake and many big skyscrapers fell into the earth, completely disappeared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The whole skyscraper just fell into the earth. That was in Caracas. They said that after that people became more pious. During the earthquake they were screaming to God, "Have mercy, have mercy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Another country, Nicaragua, just a few years ago there was a big earthquake, and the capital city was entirely destroyed. It was all gone, the entire capital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have experience of an earthquake, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was in one in Mexico. It was at night. When the earthquake happened I was completely thrown right out of my bed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was thrown right out of the bed by the earthquake. It shook the building so much, the whole building shook, and I was thrown right out of the bed. Fortunately that building I was in, it only sagged, but other buildings completely collapsed. The building was left slanting, though. We had to all evacuate the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So it reminds us of the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, because in Caracas, when there was an earthquake, the whole sky became dark, and there were great roaring sounds in the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In Caracas. Great roaring sounds and the sky became dark, no one could see, and then everything began to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When it was?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Less than ten years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Eight years ago, perhaps. My zone is very well known for that. Many times they have these disasters, and thousands of people are killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can stop these things by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> When the capital was destroyed, the president of the country... He is named Samosa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> This country's president's name is Mr. Samosa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Samosa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Samosa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">samosā?</span> Our <span class="Italic">samosā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No. [break] ...two British planes came with medicine and they wouldn't let the planes land because they have some diplomatic quarrel with England. So they preferred their own people die to save the diplomatic purpose. Also another country sent supplies to help, and they said that it was stolen. They don't know where it went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Another plane from another country came, and when they delivered all their supplies they said that everything was stolen. They don't know where it went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stolen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. The medicine was all stolen. Also the government was making many people work hard due to the disaster, and when the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are suffering from disaster. Again work hard. Just see how benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. And when the people said to the government, "You should pay us," they said, "No, we cannot pay you, and if you don't work, we will cut off your food."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga. Durbhikṣa-kārāpīḍita.</span> One side, government disturbance, one side, no food, and they let them live very happily. That's all. This is their conception of happiness. Tactation(?), taxation, and no food, and natural disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> [break] ...country in my zone. Many times big tidal waves come and many, many towns are simply carried away into the ocean and destroyed. Thousands of people... Every so many years gigantic waves come, and thousands of people are killed and many towns are destroyed. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Observe. You have got any <span class="Italic">pañjikā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. Just now bringing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So there is mention what to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Bhaumī ekādaśī</span> or <span class="Italic">Varāhadevir, āvirbhāva-janita upavāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today. Today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Budhabāra,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both together, <span class="Italic">upavāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then next day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The next day it says, <span class="Italic">dina ata pañcāś gote dostha madhye se varāhadevir arcanam te bhaumī ekādaśīr o varāha-dvādaśīr param.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So today, <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> as usual, the <span class="Italic">Varāha-dvādaśī</span> will be also observed and tomorrow breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Breakfast. Fast? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fasting tomorrow or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Regular...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply worshiping Varāhadeva. <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-śūkara-rūpa, jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> That take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Between 8:50 and 10:00 we should break the fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that called <span class="Italic">parāyaṇa</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? <span class="Italic">Parāyaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> There's a very famous lecture you gave, Śrīla Prabhupāda, one day on a <span class="Italic">Varāha-dvādaśī,</span> where you sang <span class="Italic">Jaya Jagadīśa</span> and then you explained it. A very wonderful lecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And the day after is Nityānanda's <span class="Italic">āvirbhāva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then half-day fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Auspicious alignment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...on your appearance day and Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī's and Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and Gaura Kiśora's we should observe half-day fast. I have a question that on all the other auspicious days, just like Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura and others, should we also observe half-day fast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is... But if you cannot, that is another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes because of the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If you cannot, you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And just sing some songs and praise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> is main thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And if possible, then the fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I see. [break] ...is up till sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up till sunset. Lord Rāmacandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also. And Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Half day. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of fast is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Balarāma? Half day. It is fifteen days before <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should always chant twenty-five rounds on <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> if initiated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Initiated? Everyone. Why initiated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that should be standard for our movement on <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Standard is sixteen, but if one can chant more, then he is welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not mandatory for <span class="Italic">ekādaśī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Recommended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> means that, fasting and chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes I'm wondering, because our men have to go out on book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is also preaching work. For that purpose you can stop this, but generally, one who has no preaching work, he can chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Extra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Extra.</div>
