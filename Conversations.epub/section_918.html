<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (devotees offer obeisances) Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> There's no enjoyment out there. It's all illusion. I think I tried everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was surprised that "How Ṛṣi Kumāra can fall down like this?" I had so confidence of this boy from the very beginning. He was so nice, so pure. And <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is so strong. But could not do very well, <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> very long. Thank Kṛṣṇa and... So stay with us. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy, special mercy. So always be calm and chant and pray to Kṛṣṇa. Don't spoil this life. It is so valuable. <span class="Italic">Viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt.</span> The sense gratification can be available in every life, cats and dogs also. Why should we sacrifice the greatest boon of human life? Hare Kṛṣṇa. So how are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Very good, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Seven-three was sent to the printer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Seventh Canto, Volume Three, has been sent to the printer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven-three? Oh. So our Ṛṣi Kumāra has come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> I couldn't stay away any longer, because I was so bored with everything I was doing. All I could do was chant, and then I had to come back. There's nothing that satisfies except Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best thing is to preach for some time. Go with the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party. He's a good <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> player also. His photograph is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> From the very beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Brahmānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was Brahmānanda's assistant always. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> Simply capture Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> will not be able to... When you have come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> We just got here his afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "We" means along with...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> I came with Rādhāvallabha prabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhāvallabha, just see, young boy, how he's working hard. You were doing also. You were doing so many things at a time. In Bombay you were doing herculean task, everywhere. He knows how to cook, how to give massage, how to... Yes. How to keep accounts, yes. Qualified. How to cook. Everything. So, may Kṛṣṇa save you. What can I say more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This evening, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we are arranging that you can see the film a little bit later in your room. Perhaps you would like to sit outside in the garden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. New York, how is everything going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to go outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (aside:) The chair is there? There are some people who have come, if you'd like to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I'll go. So you have given them some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We arranged for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them. They have come from distant place. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>. Lord Śiva became victimized by woman, what to speak of others? I am thinking of that boy also, Paramahaṁsa. He was a nice boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Very much so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you know where is Paramahaṁsa now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He's in Denver, Colorado. He's not doing so good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not possible to see him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Trivikrama Mahārāja went to see him, but he was too much in illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. Still, I want to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> You?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> You want us to get the message to him that he should try to come to New York to see you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> I'll try and get that message to him, to come to New York Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was very nice boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Leads nice <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> is so strong. Lord Śiva is not excused, what to speak of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> I have three sketches from the artists. Would you like to see them? This is for Eighth Canto, Volume One.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the only life, to think of publication and distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> This keeps me alive. If I didn't have this service, I think I would just die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even in this weak... I am very weak nowadays. Still, I am working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I shall not be able to go for walks. This morning my heart was beating too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very strenuous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Best would be, then, to rest, perhaps up until at least until Washington and see, because in Washington there may be a very suitable situation. It's hard to walk on these roads also. They are very rough, and the altitude is high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we will do. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> This is the story of King Indradyumna, when Agastya Muni cursed him to take birth as an elephant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> When King Indradyumna was meditating and Agastya Muni came, and so he cursed him to take birth as an elephant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He became an elephant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes, Gajendra. So the artists want to know if it is okay to show him outside in front of a cottage like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> This is a very rough sketch. This is when the demigods and demons were churning the ocean of milk with Vāsuki. So they want to make sure... So Lord Śiva will be standing outside the milk ocean. He won't be in the ocean. He'll be on the shore of the ocean, drinking the poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Sorry, it's not a very good picture. Here is the ocean. So Lord Śiva is on the shore, he's not in the ocean. He is on the shore, drinking the poison. They want to know if that's okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Okay. So then they want to know if it's okay to have Lord Śiva's bull with Lord Śiva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Where Lord Śiva can go, his bull can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So then they want to know, is it all right to show the demons and the demigods standing right on the ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were churning. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So then they can actually stand right on the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Churning was done in the water. Milk. Milk ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But they are not standing on the bottom. They are standing actually on the surface.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, yes, half water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Then a thousand-armed Viṣṇu on top of Mandara Hill? They want to know if they should show Him on top of the mountain like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> When we did Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, there were some arms that you wanted transparent. You just wanted the four main arms looking regular. So all the other arms should be transparent except for four?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is mentioned. It is mentioned. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> It just says "a thousand arms." So just paint like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> And then they just want to know... One more question on this, that remnants of the poison from Lord Śiva went to the scorpions and snakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you give this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So should they be in the ocean, or should they be on the shore with Lord Śiva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, round about. Yes. Why he's there? It is all right. Give them here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Okay. So they are on the land. And then there is one more picture. When the goddess of fortune took birth from the milk ocean, they installed her on the throne, and the personified rivers came and personified clouds. So this would be Lord Brahmā, this would be the personified rivers and different personalities. So the ocean actually is not visible, just the actual installation area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That's all that they want to know. Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. When everything do with devotion, it will come out correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our testing tubes in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Who was speaking that "If God is talking, what is use of spiritual master," yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "God will talk with anyone."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said, "God is talking with them from within."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To any rascal. Does any rascal know that God is within? And He's witnessing all criminalities. Does he accept that? Then the yogis should not have illicit connection with their disciples. Do they believe God is...? It is simply business for earning money and getting woman. They have no other... Valueless. Therefore the government has said, "Fake." What is that? Actually that is a fact. So many rascals are coming, especially in America. Government, they are seeing, "What is this?" "Transcendental meditation and do whatever nonsense you like." Guru Maharajaji: "No use of books." Practically we are saving the whole world. What can be done? There are so many rascals. Let us do it sincerely. And if we also become victimized, then it will be stopped. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari' jīve śikhāilā bhakti.</span> Anyone who says God is speaking with, immediately take him as rascal. God is so cheap that He will talk with rascals. He wants to talk, but he cannot hear. Lord Jesus advised him, "Don't steal." Why does he steal? If God is not advising from within, then why he's going at night when everyone's asleep. God is not dictating that "Don't steal"? But he will not care for God's instruction. Then it is whose fault? If I say that "You don't do it" and still you do it, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is always prepared to talk with us in talking, but we don't... He talks through devotee, He talks through scripture-who is caring for that? <span class="Italic">Sādhu-śāstra.</span> God is talking through <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> [break] Sometimes it is sweet; sometimes it is sour. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just the oranges. They have such a big variety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next, the third part, how many pages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The third part of Seventh Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the last chapter in the... I'm not sure, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I have to inquire from him. The fifteenth chapter, though, is very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It should be long. So many long purports in the fifteenth chapter of the Seventh Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What's it about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nārada Muni...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About the foretelling of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> The other day I recited so many verses. One of them, long hairs. Now see how practical. And now this is confirmation of the foretelling. Who knew five thousand years that people will keep long hairs and think of themselves as very beautiful? It is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> How it is possible unless they can see actually what is going to happen? That is foretelling. And other description, they are also fact. Everything is there. And all this is five thousand, two thousand years' foretelling. The millions and millions of years' foretelling they are. What will the eighth Manu, and how they will..., ninth Manu, tenth Manu, up to fourteenth Manu. All the Manus together, forty-three <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> thousand times. This is all the Manus' time. And the whole history is concluded that "Now I have mentioned past, present and future." It is not difficult. Just like tomorrow for my daily routine, what I shall do tomorrow from morning to evening, I can say. Is it very difficult for me? So it is a question of Brahmā's one day. So it can be said by them, not by us. These rascals think only in their standard of thinking: "I cannot live in such such, such condition; therefore there is no living entity." This is their idea. "I cannot live within the water; therefore there is no living entity. I cannot live within the fire; therefore there is no living entity." <span class="Italic">Kūpa-māṇḍūkya-nyāya,</span> the same. "Whatever is in my experience, three feet water... How there can be unlimited?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was reading a very good example like that. These men, they have this what's called divining, that they find water by means of a stick. They lay a stick on their hands like this, and they turn around in different directions, and the stick suddenly dips and points to the ground wherever there's water underground. And it's proven that it works. It's a very effective way of finding water. But no one knows how it works. So they put a suggestion during the Vietnam War to the Marines that they should use this method for finding out the underground tunnels of the Vietcong so that they could find them very easily. So they showed them by experiment that it's practical and it works, so they gave the rods to the physicists, and they checked them all out, and they couldn't figure out how they worked, so they said that because the physicists could not understand how it worked, therefore it was rejected. So they rejected the whole thing. So then the Marines in Vietnam, they heard about it, so they started to use the rods themselves, and in that way they were able to destroy many enemy hideouts. But officially the Marines had to reject it, because the scientists couldn't understand how it worked, so therefore they said that it was not good, it wasn't viable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The scientists' first proposal is, what they cannot understand, don't bring. That is not scientific. Whatever you say, that is not scientific. Whatever they say, that is scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> The word <span class="Italic">science</span> comes from the Latin word which means "to know." But they simply have theories. They don't know. But we have actual knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Their science means "don't know." (end)</div>
