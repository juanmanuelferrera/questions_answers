<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> ...for the <span class="Italic">Gaura Pūrṇimā</span> festival this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> On the land at the Caitanya Maṭha, at Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birthsite. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not to you. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You were explaining to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no. I am explaining to everyone that "Whose business he struck?" That is the way. (Hindi saying) ...that "In the assembly there is some talks, but the talks which is concerned to somebody, he becomes sorry."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You did not consult with me but I wanted to know the explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The explanation... (laughter) Now this doll should be displayed, that laboratory, they are testing urine, stool, and somebody is asking, "Here is a dead man. Why don't you test the urine and stool of this dead man and give him some injection?" This kind of doll should be displayed. The people will be interested. So I will give you suggestion. Not that stereotyped: "If one is doing something, I have to follow that." You should do something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Unique.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is wanted. It is already there in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Things show... Dolls displaying practical examples of the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are so many things in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</span> Just like a dog is swimming, and somebody captures the tail of the dog, and he thinks that "The dog will help me to cross the ocean," this kind of. So everyone is trying for liberation, but they are catching the tail of a dog for liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He must get the ship in the form of God's name. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way, practical instruction. Taking to yoga system, <span class="Italic">karma</span> system, this system, that system, but he does not know that these are like the dog's tail. Nobody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) They are criticizing you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is practically. Yes. You cannot cross over the sea by capturing the tail of a dog because you see the dog is swimming. So all this <span class="Italic">karma, jñāna, yoga,</span> they are all failure. It is just like dog tail. You cannot cross over the nescience by capturing dog's tail. You must capture the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tan aham...</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">eśa tat...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Samuddhartā mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt.</span> And explain the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā śloka. Mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt.</span> From this ocean of birth and death, if one wants to be saved, he must come to Kṛṣṇa, not to the dog's tail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Come to the ship of Kṛṣṇa. That is what we are deciding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) That you are not coming to the point of the..., quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In this kind of-<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā śloka, Bhāgavata śloka,</span> and doll exhibition-so you prepare. I will give you the suggestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, I have one point to ask you, that Vyāsa Bhagavān was not satisfied, doing all these things, and he finally composed the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> But even <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> can be called equal to any of them. <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> with the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in... With the <span class="Italic">Vidura-nīti, </span>with the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma</span> and all these things can be equal to any other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Stri-śūdra-dvija-bandhūnām</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>1.4.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is meant for less intelligent class of men:<span class="Italic"> stri, </span>woman; <span class="Italic">śūdra; </span>and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu. Dvija-bandhu</span> means persons who are born in high family but they have no education. Just like a man born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bandhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but without education, without qualification, he wants to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> They are called <span class="Italic">brahma-bandhu</span> or <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu.</span> So <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> is meant for the, these persons: <span class="Italic">stri-śūdra-dvija-bandhunam.</span> They cannot understand directly the Vedic injunctions; therefore it is simplified in a history. <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> is the history. History and stories, ordinary people, they can read with interest. But those who are advanced, they want higher philosophical thoughts. That is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ vāstava-vastu vedyam atra [SB 1.1.2]. Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam idam [SB 1.1.3].</span> It is meant for higher class. So there are different literatures for different persons. Why there are eighteen <span class="Italic">Purāṇas, sattvic, rajasic, tamasic</span>? Those who are <span class="Italic">tamasic,</span> for them it is advised...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Devī Purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Yes, you can eat meat. There is no harm. But you get it sacrificed before Goddess Kali." But this is not meant for the high-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This is meant for the third-class <span class="Italic">dvija.</span> But still, he is induced to accept some authority. In this way there are <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> Somebody is recommended to worship Lord Śiva, somebody is recommended to worship Kali, Durga, Sarasvatī, many demigods. But Nārada Muni chastised his disciple that "You have done wrong. Why you have recommended all these things?" <span class="Italic">Jugupsitam.</span> That is said there, that "People will take your authority, and they will be engaged in worshiping different demigods." Actually that is not required. Then he compiled <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> only the Supreme Lord worshiped. The same thing as Kṛṣṇa explained, <span class="Italic">mam ekam.</span> That is success. So Vyāsadeva was very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But, sir, <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja,</span> He has already said in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> also, you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He composed <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> much before he composed <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata... Gītā</span> is part of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I said. He has already mentioned that, <span class="Italic">mam ekam śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Those people who are worshiping other <span class="Italic">devas,</span> they go to the other <span class="Italic">devas'</span> house, and those who worship Me, they come to Me." Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is explained in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</span> So if Tīrtha Mahārāja is displaying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Yes, Jayapataka Mahārāja told me he was there. He saw the construction, and it's going to be two stories high, 75 feet long by 30 feet wide, and they're going to have dolls on both floors, <span class="Italic">Caitanya-līlā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That's all right. You can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> But we should make different <span class="Italic">līlās,</span> different dolls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Modern men will understand <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> by display of dolls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What are the dolls you are talking about all this time? We don't know, sir. What it means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dolls means the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata śloka</span> explained by doll display. Just like in your medical science there are sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Models.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Models, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Just you are doing pictures in your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Like that, a model.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Models. Yes, exactly the word, model. You can display... Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> this anatomic, physiologic, how the child is growing within the womb of his mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One day, fifth day, and like that. In seven months how it is developed. Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</span> Then you can display the hell, different hells.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Different hells.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Hells, oh, Fifth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How one is going by cheating others, by stealing. So everything. You can display, what is called? That planetary system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Planetarium?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Planetarium. According to planetarium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have got a big planetarium in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have got, but we have also got. So it is little difference. Just like we are calculating that the sun is the beginning of the planets, sun, then moon. Therefore we say "Sunday, Monday." This is very quite reasonable. Tuesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And Tuesday is next word because <span class="Italic">Maṅgala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And planet is 1,006,000 miles above, above. And Saturday, Saturn is the last. So now sun is calculated to be 93,000,000's miles from earth, and if the moon is still further 1,600,000, then it becomes about fifteen hundred thousand miles. No. Fifteen million miles. So how they are going, in four days, fifteen million?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You ask me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, sir, there is no going and coming. All are what we are, wherever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is another thing. That is another thing, that with their this sputnik, how they can go in four days fifteen millions miles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, in the cosmos, the whole cosmos is as big... Modern scientists understand it by what we call the force of attraction and repulsion. When you go in between the two, there is no attraction, repulsion. Then you just have this and it goes on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So we should display the real planetary system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> As it really exists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> And then we can put underneath explanations in Bengali and English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In Sanskrit and English because Sanskrit contains Bengali and Gujarati and all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's a good idea, good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I go, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Time is up? Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...many things to be displayed by these models, and we can utilize that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Like the pictures we have in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> and the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> then we can make them into doll displays, some of those pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the idea was that in our big temple I wanted to display.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Oh. You didn't want a separate building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We wanted to display where is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Vaikuṇṭha planet, where is the Goloka planet, where is this material world-in this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So if that's what you want, then we should not make a permanent structure? We should make some temporary structure like last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you decide yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So we should engage the local dollmakers in doing this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you have your place; then make dolls. But dolls should not be exactly like this, in the same way. But when you make actually, then I will give you how the models should be made. Now, how to do, where to do, that, it is your business. You decide, some of yourself, and do the needful. You have not yet done any plan for the big temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> I have been asking Jayapataka for about one year to please send me some plan of the land so that I can place all these buildings, because there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> The blueprints are done. Jayapataka is revising them now. They are in māyāpur. He is reviewing all the blueprints. They are all done. And when they are finished... When he finishes reviewing them, then we'll have them sent here immediately. I just sent them to māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> As soon as I get the plans, I will make immediately, finish everything. We can make a master plan for the whole situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So ask him to send immediately site plan and begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then others things will be there. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Tīrtha Mahārāja, for the last fifty years, he did not do anything. Now he is afraid. You know Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> In Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He approached me that "You just have a big hall in the <span class="Italic">Yogapīṭha.</span>" I immediately accepted, that "Yes, if you give us the charge we can spend immediately ten lakhs." So Śrīdhara Mahārāja has said that "If it is gone to Swami Mahārāja, then there will be no trace of Tīrtha Mahārāja." Therefore he is trying for that. So I think we shall have, according to our original plan, the temple, and in that temple we shall display all these dolls: "Here is Vaikuṇṭhaloka, here is this <span class="Italic">loka,</span> this <span class="Italic">loka,</span> this <span class="Italic">loka.</span>" That will be... [break] ...we make some arrangement for exhibition of our books very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're going to have booths in māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That Tīrtha Mahārāja will not be able to show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Never.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has no capacity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He will display only one <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> that also by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So we will make a very nice book display. I will see that there is a very nice book display made with the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritamṛtas</span> and the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> displayed. [break] ...the governor of Bengal, and he was quite congenial. He was friendly. And he agreed that if we contact him and make the proper arrangements he might come and see you there when you come to Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> I was thinking if we had him for the festival, to come to the festival, that would be a very prestigious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Why don't you arrange for that? You have to arrange. Yes. [break] ...king. Their constitution, first word is "the king can do no wrong." Yes, that is the Vedic system. Suppose a king beheads somebody by his own sword, as it was being done. Nobody can charge him that "Without any trial he has killed this man." No. Whatever is done... Just like we take Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">apāpa viddham.</span> Kṛṣṇa is never touched with any sinful activities. <span class="Italic">Apāpa-viddham. Tejiyasam na doṣaya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.33.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just as the sun, because it is very, very powerful, nothing can infect it. These are the dangers. (Hindi?) Of course, if you want to keep one in very exalted post, at the same time, if you want to find fault with him, then that is not good. That is not good. That is also stated, that <span class="Italic">arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhir guruṣu nara-matiḥ.</span> If somebody thinks that the Deity is made of stone and he criticizes, that is not allowed. If one thinks spiritual master as ordinary human being, that is not allowed. <span class="Italic">Arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhir guruṣu nara-matiḥ.</span> So those who are in highly exalted post of the state, you cannot find out fault with him. That is real Vedic way. Otherwise, if he is taken as ordinary citizen, then he is... What is the meaning of his exalted post?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) You cannot find out fault with him. As like in the court, if you find out some fault with the judge, you will be punished immediately-"Contempt of court. You cannot do that." It will be punished, because while he is on the seat of the judge, if somebody finds out fault, then his position will be lower. That is not good. I think the judgment is right. Three persons-the president, prime minister, and the speaker-cannot be, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Parliament can do that "We have no faith." What is called? "No confidence." "No confidence resolution." The Parliament has not done. "No confidence." So how the court can decide? [break] An open fact that this election... All elections are done illegally. So why this poor prime minister is captured? Everyone does. (Hindi) [break] Military police.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is occupying very exalted post, even in this material world, he is favored by Kṛṣṇa. Sanātana Gosvāmī, when the Nawab said that "I shall arrest you," then he replied that "You are representative of God, so if you arrest me I have no objection." He said that. He was Mohammedan, and he was a Hindu <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He never felt that "How the Mohammedan can arrest me?" No. He said that "You are representative of God because you are in such exalted post." (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Kṛṣṇa also says, "Anyone who is, materially even, very opulent, that means he has got some power." (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi) [break] ...in politics, how to treat with enemies, how to treat with friends, how to make... In politics there are so many things, diplomacy. So he said, "What is this nonsense? Everyone should be Kṛṣṇa conscious. They are all equal." His father became angry. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> He said it is all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. For a devotee, these politics, diplomacy, these are nonsense. But sometimes they have to do. <span class="Italic">Sate sarthaṁ samācaret.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
