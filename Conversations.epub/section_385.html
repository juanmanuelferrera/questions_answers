<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is that these <span class="Italic">daityas</span> are elected by the <span class="Italic">daityas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, sometimes even they were liked, the <span class="Italic">daityas.</span> When they have the <span class="Italic">samudra-mathana,</span> even the <span class="Italic">devas</span> went to the <span class="Italic">daityas</span> to help them. So it is... I mean, that is not so. We have to take the help of <span class="Italic">daityas</span> for a good work. But they are frustrating us. How is the argument? All right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because there are no more available <span class="Italic">devas,</span> therefore <span class="Italic">daityas</span> are the only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are like that. These rascals, you see, they have got no sense of proportion. There are two dozen mosques come up in this area without any reason in any way. And they are upset when there is construction of a Hindu temple. They are majority. So they are <span class="Italic">daityas.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...required... They, they, they required. We are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are thinking themselves to be qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are... We are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What do... They are getting qualified every day by <span class="Italic">madeira</span> (?). And what other things which I don't want to talk to you. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when it is mixed, it is called <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, the <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkaras</span> are more strong today than the pure <span class="Italic">saṅkaras.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...question, I shall try to answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Give you a question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yeah. I have taken out a <span class="Italic">śloka</span> from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for you. And my friends always tells me not to put it before you because it will create a sort of a hot discussion. But I am going to put it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is this... <span class="Italic">Ye 'py... Bolo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> <span class="Italic">Ye 'py anya...</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">...mām. Ye 'py anya-devatā</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhaktāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ye 'pi bhaktāḥ. Nei. Bhajante, śraddhayānvitāḥ, te 'pi mām eva bhajante, te 'pi mām eva kaunteya yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam.</span> They are also <span class="Italic">bhajanti, avidhi-pūrvakam.</span> I mean, no doubt, they also, all, all who worship go to Kṛṣṇa's feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like, just like if you want to give me some food to eat. So you should give me to my mouth, not to my rectum. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they are doing it now. We are giving enema. We treat with enema in America. (laughs) He said, he said that don't give these things to him because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is, this is the reason: To give one food, there is the only one mouth. You cannot say, "Because there are so many holes, any hole."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that is not the real..., I mean, real argument that you give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But my question is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Avidhi-pūrvakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but they're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Avidhi-pūrvakam.</span> But also, still, they are worshiping God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Everyone is part and parcel of God, but everyone is not God. That is the way. That any hole of my body, that is my body. But when food is to be taken, it is only this, not another, other hole. That is the way. [break] ...and if you are saying like that... Just like... Here... When you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But it is of the... is doing that to you also. Why do you worry about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. When the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We can give it in the vein also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. (laughter.) That is not the way. That is <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But... Listen. That is why I say, disease or no disease, <span class="Italic">vidhi's</span> going to help your body and bring you nutrients, even given by intravenously or by rectum or by mouth. By any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they are going to... He's going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is... This is for the nonsense. You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Having the... Why nonsense now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If the way is this, that food should be taken within the mouth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But this is also... This is what is said by Kṛṣṇa, by Himself in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. <span class="Italic">Avidhi-pūrvakam.</span> Everything is <span class="Italic">sevā,</span> but <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It may be <span class="Italic">sevā,</span> but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Kaṁsa. Kaṁsa was thinking of Kṛṣṇa always. But he's not a devotee. <span class="Italic">Avidhi-pūrvakam.</span> No, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he was not a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> He was an enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no. Therefore... He was thinking of Kṛṣṇa, but still, he's not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But here is the question of devotee: <span class="Italic">ye 'py anya-devatā-bhaktāḥ bhajante mām avidhi-pūrvakam. Bhakta.</span> They are <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> not enemies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Bhakta.</span> One who worships God, he's a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> Just like sometimes you have to go to the chief minister through his <span class="Italic">cāparāsī.</span> But the <span class="Italic">cāparāsī</span> is not the chief minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. But a chief minister gets pleased through the <span class="Italic">cāparāsī.</span> All right. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you, if you say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not my argument it is, eh? This is the argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is wrong argument. You see... Just like our Hadaji Batlar (?), he was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, how would it be wrong argument, sir? We are following the same process. We collected those foodstuffs... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...commissioner is not the politician. Why do you mix them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But Kṛṣṇa was never a politician. He was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is a wrong theory. This is a wrong theory. You can approach somebody through somebody, but they are two, individual persons. [break] ...He is <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "I am enjoyer of all the <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> to whom, whatever and to whomever you are doing." How would you accept that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The king. The king is the proprietor of all taxes. But he's not a tax collector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, now, Chando Bhai, come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The king...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> What do you want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is the proprietor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ hi sarva-bhoktānāṁ bhakto māṁ parameśvaram</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the king, and there are many tax collectors. So tax goes to the king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, king, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It does not belong to the tax collectors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Correct.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So you transcend them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Everything, everything is connected with Me, but I am not that." That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Much more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarva-bhūtāni, mat-sthānīti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> He's much more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can exist without Kṛṣṇa. But that does not mean everybody's Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But there is nobody other than Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Excepting the <span class="Italic">jīvas,</span> as you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, as I am reading the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> today, everything is emanating from Kṛṣṇa. Even your <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> are part and parcel of Viṣṇu's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that doesn't mean Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">jīva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he's evolved from everything, and nothing can exist without Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If that is the real thing, then, I mean, any, any other <span class="Italic">deva</span> being worshiped as good as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like everything is material energy, but that does not mean this land is the sea. That is nonsense. That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, it is not...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am giving you the argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. It is nonsense.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no! No, no! There cannot be. If you say the sea and the land is the same, this is completely nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nonsense in this present circumstances. You change the circumstances!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any circumstances! Any circumstances!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Other circumstances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any circumstances! You cannot say... We say that this is matter. But you cannot say that land is water, water is land. You cannot say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Would you please give me a hearing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, everything is matter, that is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. That is what I want to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I admit! That I admit. That is the difficulty of the Māyāvādīs. They cannot distinguish the varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Land is the whole <span class="Italic">Brahman.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The Māyāvādī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Whenever it is (?) a question of matter is evolved from <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So we are Māyāvādīs, all of you and me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, because we are talking of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> means <span class="Italic">śakti. Māyā</span> means <span class="Italic">śakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's it. Then <span class="Italic">śakti's</span> of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nothing can happen without the <span class="Italic">śakti.</span> Nothing can happen without the energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You cannot move your finger...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot avoid the varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But variety is produced by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in your body, this is your head, this is your hand. Everything is body. But if you say, "Everything is body," what is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can it be nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! It is nonsense!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That particular...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why there is separate name, "This is head, this is hand, this is leg."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When this thing, whole body, was in the embryo...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is called "unity in varieties." That is called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And I will... Shall I speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you cannot say the head and the leg is the same!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Let me talk now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say that!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I talk it now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When this body was being manufactured in the embryo, in the womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I know that you don't require this! I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is matter. But it becomes varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was not matter to anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That was also inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the seed there is the whole banyan tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, matter... They manifested into varieties. First of all, they, after sex intercourse, the two seminas is emulsified, and it becomes like a pea. And it develops into different parts of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Right, but I, what I am coming to this point is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...even in <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad,</span> from a small seed, big banyan tree has come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So seed is the real thing. And that seed is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So everything is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again, everything is Kṛṣṇa! Same nonsense, same nonsense. (laughs) Kṛṣṇa says, "I am not that." <span class="Italic">Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...correction in the second <span class="Italic">śloka</span> only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no! It is not correction. It is correction because we fools, we cannot understand Him clearly. "So although everything is existing in Me, I am not everything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Still, everything existing in Me." But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is that?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogam aiśvaram.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in this hotel. There are so many furnitures, so many rooms. If you say, "Everything is hotel," what is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ah, but without furniture hotel cannot be? Without building, hotel cannot be. Without this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why do you say, "It is furniture"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...parts, all this, the body cannot be.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ah, but then you take out the furniture, hotel will not be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you cannot say the furniture is the hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am arguing like a Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So you have gone on the top of the tree. We are trying to give him the root.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say, when the tree is grown, you cannot say, "The leaf is also root. The fruit is also root. The trunk is also root." This is nonsense.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. How you can say everything is the sa...? There is varieties. This is called <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda-tattva</span> philosophy. Simultaneously one and different. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy. <span class="Italic">Acintya-bhedābheda,</span> simultaneously one and different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is a philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like my the same example: the water is matter, and this is also matter. As matter, they're one, but as water, it is different; as land, it is different. This is simultaneously one and different.</div>
