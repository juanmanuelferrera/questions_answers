<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...want to die. It does not matter whether one is a young man or an old man. So before death takes places we must be fully Kṛṣṇa conscious." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They will think it is fairy tale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fairy tale, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Because they don't believe anything that they cannot see with their gross senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolishness. You cannot see in the sky so many things. Now this plane is going on. It may be unseen for some time. So that is the only reason? Because they cannot see? They cannot see milk? They have seen milk or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Their experience of sea is that it has salt water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is water. As water is also liquid, milk is also liquid. So if there is ocean of water, why not ocean of milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> There can be, but,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There can be, yes. So how they can say that there cannot be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They would say that "The milk comes from the cow. So how could it be an ocean?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water comes from man. If you pass urine, there is water. What is the difference? The water also comes from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It is just that it is beyond their experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That experience should be gathered from authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. I also tell them sometimes that "Did you see your grandfather?" They say "Well, no." "But you still accept that he was there." They say, "Yes, because my father tells me, somebody else says." Similarly, I said that "Even though you didn't see your grandfather, you accept that there is a grandfather." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...contradiction of the law of gravitation. According to our <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> the planets are held on the hood of Ananta. He is carrying. But they say they are staying on account of law of gravitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's supreme energy as you explain, <span class="Italic">tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ yathā vinimaya,</span> that is water, He creates, He can do anything. The scientists may make any laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But they cannot use that law. They cannot float any other thing in the air by this law. Still they say, "There is law of gravitation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "They were also informed of the external..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He have to accept so much dowry, how many thousands horses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Fifteen thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who will take dowry like this? (laughing) And how many? Four hundred elephants. Who can maintain four hundred elephants? Nowadays horses and elephants are not selling because nobody can maintain. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Only the zoos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...animal-eaters, later on, they will not find animals to eat. They will eat themselves. Because animals are not being maintained, they may be, according to Darwin's theory, extinct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In the US and everywhere they maintain them just for slaughter. So will that dwindle out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, slaughtering, slaughtering. When there will be no more, where this question of slaughtering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. When there are no more animals, where will reproduce?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They maintain elephant also for slaughtering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> When I was in America I heard last year there was a beef shortage. There was a meat shortage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Meat shortage, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They import a lot of beef from Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Go on reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Here also scarcity will start. Slaughtering means... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This example is given. Suppose we are walking. This step, when I assure that "This is all right, it is not, it will not go down," then I take up this. Then again this. This example is given. Similarly, change of body like that. As soon as it is settled up what kind of body he is going to accept or which is being offered to him, <span class="Italic">daiva-netreṇa,</span> by higher authority, then this man leaves this body and again enters in the womb of the body which he is destined to get. This is the process of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Is that immediate, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediate. Just like immediate I am walking. When it is fixed up, then I take up. Then when it is fixed up, then I take up, like this. Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> What about hell? How does the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul go to hell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They go. Those who are going to hell, that is fixed up very quickly. It doesn't take much time. Hell means he is getting the next body, hellish body. That's all. Suppose he is going to get the hellish body to become the worm of stool, so in that way he enters the worm, mother worm, to get the body and enjoy the hell. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Don't they sometimes have to go to Yamarāja first for practice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">daiva-netreṇa.</span> These things are finished very quickly. And if it takes little time, then this man who is dying, he remains in coma and does not die. Because the judgement is going on, the decision waiting, coma. You have seen sometimes a man is in coma for seven days, eight days? Yes. That means his judgement is going on, that... Such kind of death means very sinful death. Not yet settled up, very complicated case. Therefore it takes time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> What about persons who die in their sleep? Is that a sinful death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dream or awakened, everything is dream, gross dream and subtle dream. That's all. This is also dream. What do you mean by dream? Dream means existent for a little period. That's all. So night dream is for two hours and this dream is for twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So in other words when it says that one goes to hell, any lower species is also like hell. If one is going to assume a dog's body, then does he go to hell before he assumes a dog's body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is statement like that, that one is put into the hellish condition for practicing little, and then he is put into the womb of such mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Is that a long duration of practice or just..., very short?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, very short. Short mean their short. It may take little more time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Now they have machines that when the person is in coma, the machines artificially keep the heart beating and the other processes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then heart beating will go on, either you apply machine or no machine. Heart beating. But when the heart stops, no machine can revive it. So what is the use of machine? But by nature's way when the heart beating will stop, no machine can help. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So the doctors face a dilemma, that they keep the heart going by the machine, but they don't know whether the patient is actually living or dead. So they are afraid to stop the machine. They don't know how to decide when to stop the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But when they stop it...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Then the patient is dead. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is the modern science, so imperfect. They don't even know whether a person is live or dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they know? They know something, but everyone knows. Even the birds and beasts, they also know something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "In this way, one after another the body changes and the soul transmigrates. See how the plant worms change from one twig to another so carefully. Similarly the living entity changes his body as soon as the higher authorities decide on his next body." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the modern civlization is that they have no knowledge about the change of body. Almost 99 percent people, they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even the so-called religions, the religions even don't teach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "This body is exactly like one of the bodies which we always see in dreams. During our dream of sleep we create so many bodies according to mental creation." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the psychologically whatever mental condition we prepare throughout this life, that means you are preparing next life, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvam tyajanty ante kalevaram [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> The situation of the mind at the time of death will carry you to the similar body. Just like one who likes to eat some special foodstuff, so... Suppose the meat-eaters... So the mentality is "How to eat meat, how to eat meat." So they are given next life the canine teeth to give facility for eating meat. Canine teeth means dogs, cats, tigers, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Unless we have a particular type of body, we cannot enjoy or suffer according to our mental proclivities inherited from the previous life." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...another example. <span class="Italic">Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> It is said that this living entity is untouched by this material body. <span class="Italic">Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> So the example is given that the moon reflected on water appears to be moving, but moon is separate from that movement. (Hindi) Go on. (Hindi) [break] ...good example. Unnecessarily he thinks that "I belong to this country, I belong to this society." That means he creates another body. And if he knows perfectly well that "I do not belong to any of these bodies," that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That teaching required, that every being is unattached to this body. Therefore <span class="Italic">yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape...</span> Anyone who is maintaining himself under bodily concept of life, he is no better than the animals. [break] The demonic person does not accept any good lesson. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeṣo hi prakopāya na śāntaye.</span> Because he is foolish, if you give him good advice, he will be angry. Still, we have to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> But it is better to find some innocent persons, for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, better field, those who are innocent. That is the duty of the preacher, four things: <span class="Italic">īśvare tad-adhīneṣu baliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca.</span> The preacher should see four things. First of all <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> the Supreme Person, God. So that vision must be there. He knows what is <span class="Italic">īśvara</span> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then <span class="Italic">tad-adhīneṣu,</span> those who have taken shelter of that <span class="Italic">īśvara.</span> That means devotees. <span class="Italic">Tad-adhīneṣu.</span> And then <span class="Italic">baliśeṣu. Baliśeṣu</span> means those who are innocent, have no sufficient knowledge, innocent. And <span class="Italic">dviṣatsu.</span> And there is always a class of men who are envious of God, <span class="Italic">dviṣat. Dviṣat</span> means envious. So preacher has to see these four classes of men or three classes. One, <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> and the other three classes. So he has to behave like that. To behave with <span class="Italic">īśvara-prema,</span> how to love. That is his business. How to increase love for the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Prema. Maitrī,</span> how to make friendship with the devotee. And to the innocent<span class="Italic">-kṛpā,</span> how to become merciful. And to the envious<span class="Italic">-upekṣa,</span> negligence, not to talk with them. Four behavior. <span class="Italic">Īśvare tad-a...</span> This is <span class="Italic">madhyama adhikārī.</span> And the position of the preacher is <span class="Italic">madhyama adhihkārī.</span> Therefore they have to point out, "Here is a jealous man, envious man." But people do not want it. They say, "Why you are pointing out? Why you are pointing out?" But this is business of the preacher. Otherwise how he will preach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They want to be artificially the <span class="Italic">uttama adhikārī,</span> to see everyone as nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, everyone as nice, except himself. <span class="Italic">Uttama adhikārī</span> vision, that everyone is nice. Then the preacher is also nice. Why you find out fault with the preacher? So imitation <span class="Italic">uttama adhikārī</span> will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> [break] "...those who are demoniac or atheistic by nature can hardly assimilate any good instruction, however authorized it may be. That is the difference between a demigod and a demon." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, at the present moment, <span class="Italic">bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānām tayāpahṛta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 2.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Demons, they are too much attached to material enjoyment, <span class="Italic">bhoga</span> and <span class="Italic">aiśvarya.</span> So they cannot take to it. Therefore our general principle is to perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> not to talk philosophy. When one is interested, then he can talk philosophy. Otherwise this talk should be amongst inner circles, with the students and the teacher, those who are submissive. Otherwise it should be avoided. It will create misunderstanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> What about programs at schools and colleges?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are innocent. The children, they are innocent. So if possible, give them some enlightenment, <span class="Italic">kṛpā,</span> to become merciful upon them. So far children are concerned, they hear, they try to learn. Just like in Dallas, whatever we say, they accept. They do not protest. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Vasudeva thought of his wife as follows: 'For the present let me save the life of Devakī and later on, if there are children, I shall see how to save them.' He further thought..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the consideration. By policy if he could save his wife, that first. He was following like that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> " 'If in the future I get a child who can kill Kaṁsa, just as Kaṁsa is thinking, then both Devakī and the child will be saved, because the law of providence is inconceivable. But now someway or other let me save the life of Devakī.' " [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...jumps. In the village also there is experience, when there is fire, it jumps over another house, leaving one house in the middle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Similarly, a living entity may be very careful and fearful in the matter of executing his duties, but it is still very difficult for him to know what type of body he is going to get in the next life. Mahārāja Bharata was very faithfully executing the duties of self-realization, but by chance he contacted temporary affection for a deer, and he had to accept his next life in the body of a deer." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not liberal. He was truthful. He used to bring all the sons as soon as born to Kaṁsa, and he was killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Kaṁsa knew the value of Vasudeva's word of honor and he was convinced by his arguments. For the time being he desisted from the heinous killing of his sister. Thus Vasudeva was pleased and praised the decision of Kaṁsa. In this way he returned to his home. After due course of time Vasudeva and Devakī gave birth to eight male children as well as..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demons are known as <span class="Italic">sura-dviṣām, sura-dviṣām,</span> those who are envious of the demigods, <span class="Italic">sura-dvisa. Sammohāya sura-dviṣām [SB 1.3.24].</span> This word is used in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata:</span> "just to cheat the demons," <span class="Italic">sammohāya sura-dviṣām.</span> [break] That is the instruction of Nārada. You see? Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Within the prison, shackled in iron chains, Vasudeva and Devakī gave birth to a male child year after year. Kaṁsa, thinking each of the babies to be the incarnation of Viṣṇu, killed them one after another."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He killed his brother. He was merciful upon the father only, kept him in the prison. Otherwise he killed the whole family-brother, brother's son and everyone. [break] ...present kings, such incidences are very many in the history, killing everyone. There is another story that Pana, Pana?</div>
