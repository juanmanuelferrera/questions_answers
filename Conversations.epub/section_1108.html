<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) ...article in... (Hindi) I was very much satisfied. New Vrindaban. Who wrote it? Somebody went there in my New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I think Mr. Dvari. That I can find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) The people are misled. They do not know. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum. Artha-brāhmaṇa-paṇḍita [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. </span>Pandiya means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yeah. <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's from Benares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pandiya means <span class="Italic">paṇḍita. Brāhmaṇa.</span> (Hindi) Illiterate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Actually if a man is literate but if there is no <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> I can't say he is better than... If <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> is there and no education, then still I call he is better man. The man without <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> is nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is..., that <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> means <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> to become <span class="Italic">satyaṁ śamo damas titikṣā ārjavaṁ jñāna... Jñāna...</span> You can have knowledge simply by hearing, not by reading books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, by reading and writing all these things. (Hindi) By hearing, knowledge by hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It gave him <span class="Italic">rāja-vidyā,</span> which that Mrs. Dutt... you know that editor of that government paper? So I just wanted him to have a final look, grammatical... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? What are these beads?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. It was lying here, so I have packed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. Have they been chanted or anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (at same time) Have you seen the Chinese <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know what for it was taken here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't know where they came from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> French. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They take it trifle. Husband and wife who are fighting, <span class="Italic">dam-pate kalahe caiva bambharambhe laghu kriya.(?)</span> If there is fight between husband and..., it will be... The show will be very big, and the result will be nil. <span class="Italic">Bambharambhe laghu-kriya.</span> "Never come to me! I shall not see your face! If you come, I shall kill you!" So on, so on. Then next moment they are talking. <span class="Italic">Bambharambhe laghu-kriya</span>. These are taken very lightly, no seriously. Now they are going... Nowadays, in the court case, fifty percent of cases are divorce in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Same in the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is also younger age, no old. Old age, they are never... There is no such case. Only younger generation, within thirties, twenty to thirty, they are fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even in the West, the Roman Catholic Church wouldn't allow divorce. The Church of England was started on that because Henry VIII didn't like his wife, and he wanted to divorce, and the Roman Catholic Church wouldn't let him. So then he did do, so they excommunicated him. So then he started his own church and made up his own laws. Otherwise, now there's a big push in Italy for divorce and everything, but even in the last ten years there's been no divorce. They don't allow it. And chastity of the woman was still very greatly appreciated too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woman infidel, they are stoned among the Muhammadans. Christian also. "You have done..." Woman proved unchaste, she was punished. Is it not? The public would stone and kill. You know that punishment? Stoning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Stoning, yes. It's mentioned a lot in early Christian times. They used to stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will throw a stone. Very tortuous death, stoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I remember my auntie's mother. She was Italian, and she used to wear black all the time. Just like the widows here, they wear white, so she was wearing black. She was a widow. So all the widows, even I saw some young women...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here also, in Gujarat, they wear black, black sari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, right. And they wear black, and they don't dress attractively at all, and there's no question of marrying again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Russia also, respectable widows, they used to live in widow's home. They would never marry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And they would wear black too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen that house when I was in Moscow. That was one of the... What is called...? They go to see, especially tourists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Red Square?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Red Square. No, I mean to say what is that called when they go to see specially something? Foreign Mecca(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sightseeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, no. Sightseeing. So anyway, they took us to a house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, you went on a sightseeing tour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes, that "Here, respectable widows." In Russia, after being widow, they used to live along with other respectable widows. They would never marry. Widow house. Live with queens and other respectable ladies. This was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now I think about seven or eight marriages out of every ten in Russia end up in divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I just have to finish... [break] (end)</div>
