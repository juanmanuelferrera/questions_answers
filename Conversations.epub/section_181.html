<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Class must be. Without hearing, everything will be tainted. (knock on door) Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda, what do you think about the German translation work? I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It must go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I know it must go on. But isn't there some way to increase it, to make it go more quickly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything should be done quickly. Because we do not know when we shall die. So everything, Kṛṣṇa consciousness business, should be done as quickly as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I mean in that respect... see, everything must go through Maṇḍalībhadra's hands. Before it can be printed, everything has to go through his hands because he is the chief translator. But at the present moment it's going so slowly that... We haven't even been able to produce the magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So find out somebody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, that's my proposal. Or make a different arrangement. But one arrangement I proposed was to pay him some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I proposed that we pay him some money so that he can do it full time instead of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So yes, you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Is that okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> If he needs some money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Cause right now he's working full time, eight hours and day and still he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So if that's okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he requires some money, give him. What can be done? That is not unusual. A <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> he requires some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, I understand. I just wanted to know if it was acceptable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why not acceptable? No. Yes. Yes. That's all right. Let him take. We are paying Hayagrīva also. What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And another thing I wanted to ask you about, Prabhupāda, is that Maṇḍalībhadra, he wants to make your literature perfect, which is natural because we want to make the nicest presentation. But the devotees are saying that the translation... For instance, this <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets,</span> has been in the process so long, it has so many times been reworked, that it's no longer palatable to them. They don't even read it. They'd rather have the English version. So I know that Your Divine Grace has said you have full faith in his ability to do the work...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If you... you find out somebody else. He can also do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Because my opinion is that he's becoming overworked, it's becoming strained, so much so that we're not even able to bring it to the printer because he insists on making every time more and more corrections.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) It never comes to perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It never comes to perfection. It can, you know. For instance, this little booklet, <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets,</span> one of the things that has been holding it up is because the diacritic marks, to get the diacritic marks in there perfectly... We took it to a professional composer. Of course, they're not experienced, so they didn't, at first they didn't want to do it and then... At any rate, my opinion was first let us print it without the diacritic marks, and then the second edition make it with diacritic marks. Improve it by editions rather than wait until it's completely perfect before we put it on the market because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if once it is made perfect, then it will be easier to print more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's true, but see, what has happened is the entire sum has been lost...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He could not finish any one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, not even the magazine was finished. The magazine before this recent one, I put it together myself from old magazines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many German students. They cannot do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They can do, but the thing is that you have said that he is the chief and unless it goes through him, it can't be printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no. No, no. No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everything is bottle-necked around him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the important subject, he may do slowly, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> or <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Others may be done by others. You print it. Even there is some mistake, that doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. And another thing I wanted to ask Your Divine Grace is this. This <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> I would like to print it as it becomes finished chapter by chapter. Otherwise it will be a long time before we have a book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you can publish, chapter by chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Because these German people, they have to have books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You give them chapter by chapter. That's all. We should use our intelligence. You give something, full. So chapter by..., introduction, chapter by chapter, like that. And others may also translate, which is not very intelligent. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... So do like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They have some of our philosophy. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...who has finally approved it, to see if it was up to standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well it reminds me of Janārdana. You know Janārdana was a big scholar and he was very intelligent, but he never produced very much. You remember Janārdana? So Maṇḍalībhadra is working full time. He never comes to the temple. Of course, he lives far away, but he never comes to the temple. And I know when a person doesn't come to the temple, it's very difficult for him to maintain, especially if he maintains a full time job. It has an imperceptible effect on your consciousness. And he also, you know, we sometimes, we don't see very much eye to eye. Like for instance, this coming <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> he wanted to produce, he wanted to put a picture of some of the... Like there's a picture in one of the old <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads</span> of Vṛndāvana. So I said, "This picture is not good because Kṛṣṇa is not in this picture. There's no Kṛṣṇa. We must have..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Old Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, some buildings. Like Jaya Govinda used to write those articles, you remember? He used to write articles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Comic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no, not comics. He would take some pictures of the scenery of Vṛndāvana, like the Yamunā or some of the temples, like Madana-Mohana temple, like that. So I said, "We must have a picture of Kṛṣṇa or a devotee or Prabhupāda. It can't be without some activity, some form, because people will not understand what it is. It may be very nice for us." So I feel that he has to either associate more with the temple or he must be paid some money so that he can work full time and... Some change must be made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No you pay and... You pay him money, and he must come. Both things should be done. He must come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Right. He should have a lot of association with devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without association, it will be whim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's essential. Otherwise he'll become dry and... I mean that's what I fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall write to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He may also come to visit you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I will advise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He may. I don't know. He's also having a little, even though he's working, having a little money problem. And another thing I want to ask Your Divine Grace: We have not invited you to Germany because I thought that I didn't want to impose on your time because your time is very valuable, but if you'd like to come to Germany, we can arrange a program for you in Heidelburg, and there, Pradyumna says, there are some big professors there that are important. If you like to come there, it's not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can arrange a meeting amongst the scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Some scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But another thing is that I do not know German language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They all speak English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They generally speak English very well. Generally, they all know English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if some scholars' and philosophers' meeting is going on that will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Then I will try to do that. What about a meeting in the biggest hall of Heidelburg? Would you also be interested in that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I will have to speak in English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. They know English. This city is especially English. They, practically everyone knows English. Very, very, many people from America are always there. Especially the younger people, they all know English. It's a center for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It's the best German university. The most famous German university is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And Śivānanda. Shall Śivānanda come here to see you? He wants to know about his taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> He can either go to Paris and meet you there or he can come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot go to Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He can go to Paris and meet you there. The Hamburg devotees will meet you in Paris. They will not come to the festival because it's very complicated for us to come here and expensive. So they will... And Śivānanda can also go to Paris or he can come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is possible, come here, join this festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. I'll let him know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Also the Olympic games are held in Germany this year. There will be people from all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Games?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The Olympic games.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Sport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> A big sport festival in Munchen. [break] And so we have some girls and they have asked us, they want to be married. What is our position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Be married legally first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Legally. And they will be living outside the temple for sure. Is that correct, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And with a job and like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they can live in the temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But they will live separate .</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Then what is the use of getting married? (end)</div>
