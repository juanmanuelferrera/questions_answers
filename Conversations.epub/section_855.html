<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of the mind of God. And it is delivered (indistinct) False mind is delivered (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You made the statement in your purport that the moon is giving life to the vegetation on this planet. So how <span class="Italic">it</span> can be a desert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have just said. They cannot talk about moon. That means they did not go. That is now clear. [break] ...has answered my question why Monday first, er, Sunday first and Saturday last? All over the world, in India also, Sunday, er, Monday first, Sunday first, Monday second. Ask your scientist friend why this arrangement, Sunday first, Monday second, Saturday last? We have concluded that it will take seven months to reach the moon planet at the speed of eighteen thousand miles per hour. But they're going in four days. (everyone laughs) Just see how bluffing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But they don't calculate the moon to be so far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We did that calculation on the basis of 95,000,000 miles, which is about 2,000,000 miles from what the distance we get from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> combined with 93,000,000 miles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they say (sic:) ninety-three miles. Sun is (sic:) ninety-three miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But we don't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We say also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What? 93,000,000?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four billion is the..., what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Diameter of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Diameter of the universe. Sun is almost in the middle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So what is that distance that is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> then? It says 100,000 <span class="Italic">yojanas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think that is.... Moon that is far away from the sun, 1,600,000. (indistinct) fire in the sea, <span class="Italic">varuṇāgni.</span> (indistinct) You know there is sometimes fire in the sea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In what way? Volcano? Like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Volcano eruption. Is there any technical term? <span class="Italic">Varuṇāgni.</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You mean like when there's an eruption from below? Say when an island's formed, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is called <span class="Italic">varuṇāgni,</span> fire in the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Would you say some eruptions from below the earth's crust comes up, and then, er, all the gases underneath push the land up above the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is fire within the earth, just as there is fire within the stomach-fire. That helps digestion. In the Ayurvedic <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> when one does not feel an appetite, it is called <span class="Italic">agni-māṁdya</span> (indistinct), rest and (indistinct) of the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How can the fire within the stomach be increased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He said that by taking cold milk, that dampens the fire. I thought that was what we said. That's what I was always told.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Certain foods are cooling to the stomach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Appetite is increased on account of the fire. The fire creates different secretions: blood. This is a big machine. It is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yantra.</span> How this <span class="Italic">yantra</span> is working? Electricity, everything, air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Are persons who are trying to cut down appetite, they should eat cool foods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Persons who are trying to eat less and less for spiritual life, they should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, less is not spiritual. Whatever you want to eat, your food must be.... Machine is going on by the order of God. It is not after your order. But if you violate laws, then it is disturbed. The more that the fire is disturbed, oblations to the fire-<span class="Italic">svāhā</span>-that is eaten by God. (indistinct) Grains are offered, fruits are offered, in the fire <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> It is through the fire, so as the part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we have got little fire, we eat through that. In the fire you put tons of grains, tons of <span class="Italic">ghee</span>-everything will be consumed. Similarly, if the fire is there, whatever you eat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Whatever is there in the universal form is found in small quantity in the bodies that the living entities get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are small universe. There is word, <span class="Italic">cha ache brahmāṇḍe, ta ache i bandhe.(?)</span> The arrangement what is there, universally, the same as in the smallest entity (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So many completes coming from the whole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drop of water, the chemical composition is the same as big ocean. (airplane flying overhead) ...feet, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> About 35,000 feet up. Just under seven miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wants to go against the current. That is their sporting. There is an example is given by Tulasī dāsa. <span class="Italic">Baijad gajarāja</span>(?)(indistinct) A small fish, it will go against the current, and if you put one elephant, he cannot, he'll be washed away. Why the fish, the small fish can go against the current and the elephant is washed out? Because that fish is under the shelter of the ocean; the elephant is foreigner. This is example. So one who takes shelter of the Supreme, he can do anything. Otherwise he'll be washed away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's a good example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Bhaijad gajarāja(?) (indistinct) Gajarāja</span> means the king of elephants, he'll be washed away. But a small fish will go against the current.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that from the Eighth Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is from Tulasī dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. Like it says in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> if you have the mercy of Lord Caitanya, a big thing becomes easy, but if you don't have His mercy, then a small thing becomes difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> [break] ...the universe was created five to ten billion years ago. Do we agree with their proposition, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say that this universe was created five to ten billion years ago. Do we agree with that proposition, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it was before? (indistinct) Or gas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, they basically have two theories. Either the "Big Bang" theory...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Theories! Don't take theories. Nonsense. Theory is speculation, nonsense. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was just reading last night in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> how Lord Brahmā saw Kṛṣṇa produce hundreds and millions of universes and Lord Brahmās and cowherdboys and cows and calves from His body, and then they entered back into His body within a moment. (laughs) It's going to be a little difficult for these scientists to appreciate the actual creative potency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he thinks Kṛṣṇa is like him, but He's busier (indistinct). It is said this water is the semina of Kṛṣṇa. So they will say, "How you can...? So much semina?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well there are some theories where they think the universe was started from a big lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom the lake came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, actually they say that that's not so important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your word is also not important. "That is not important. His word is important." Do you see the point? Whatever he'll say, that is important. So anyone can say something that is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> That is to say that to understand the universe may be difficult. So therefore then they try to explain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can stop, don't talk. "Why you are talking like nonsense?" If it is difficult, accept it; don't talk. Take difficult things and talk nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Because they all have a yearning to want to know these things. They all have a yearning to want to know these things about the mystery of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you know from the proper person. As you are very much eager to teach us, similarly, you learn; you can teach. Why do you talk nonsense without learning? You are scientist. You have to teach me. But from which scientist you have learned? So anyone can say something nonsense and become a teacher? Not teacher, but cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They have many persons that they accept as authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They have many persons that they accept as authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have many fools? Maybe like you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> (laughs) Yes, I admit, I am the biggest fool. But they accept some people-just like Isaac Newton. They accept him as a great authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Perhaps it's a speculation-I'm not certain. But in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it describes that lust is also sometimes like a fire. Practically one experiences that the heat in the body, the lusty desires increases heat within the body. So is there any correlation between fire within the body and the mode of passion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Passion is there. Just like fire, if you fan it, it blazes more. Similarly, with passion, the fire is more powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Then the passion is like the fuel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lust is sometimes described as fire, <span class="Italic">kāmāgni.</span> Heart burns, the lusty desire burns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> What about <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span>? Does <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> have a relationship with the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tamo-guṇa</span> is laziness. It is ass. Neither fire. Ignorance. Civilized man, they're working, making some material arrangement nice. That is mode of passion. But the uncivilized, he doesn't want to work. Just like this Hawaii was under the Hawaiians' control, they could not do anything. Ignorant, lazy. <span class="Italic">Tamo-guṇa,</span> darkness, is no work, no reason. Simply like animals, sex-life. And <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa,</span> there is activity to create material facilities. And <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> "Why you are working? What is the aim of my life?" That is <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So it's better to be in the mode of passion than the mode of ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No. We have to come to the mode of goodness. That is wanted. Neither passion nor ignorance. But passion is better than ignorance. That is comparative. But best quality in this material world is goodness. When knowledge is sufficient. And beyond that, <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva</span>. Here in this material world even goodness is disturbed sometimes by passion and ignorance. But the platform where no more disturbance by all these three qualities, that is <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva.</span> That is spiritual. Devotees are expected to remain on that platform, <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva,</span> pure goodness. Then they will not be disturbed by these three qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> In the mode of ignorance, if he wishes to come to the platform of the mode of goodness, does he have to pass through the mode of passion to get to the mode of goodness? Or can you go directly from the mode of ignorance to the mode of goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You can instantly go to the platform of pure goodness. (end)</div>
