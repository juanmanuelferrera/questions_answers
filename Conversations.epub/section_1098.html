<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...so glorious. Glorious. He's glorious. That's all right. But <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</span> will imitate his behavior, but he is not fixed up. Therefore it is not good for him. He is forbidden. This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's forbidden to hear from a nondevotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will commit so many mistakes and they'll take it for granted. Just like this "Nitāi-Gaura, Rādhe-Śyāma." That is avoided for <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.</span> There are so many mistakes, <span class="Italic">rasābhāsa.</span> So two things are there always, two sides. One for the <span class="Italic">mahā-bhāgavata,</span> one for the ordinary <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī.</span> So in the temple it is to be supposed generally for the <span class="Italic">madhyama-adhikārī</span> and <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</span> especially. So in the temple we should not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We should just listen to whatever the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I remember once before, a few years ago, you sent a letter out saying that no one should try to compose songs or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I do not encourage. What they will compose? They have no realization. But they're speaking something about Kṛṣṇa. That's his beginning. Just like a child, he speaks half-broken. That is not language. It has no meaning. But still the child, "Ah, ah, you are so nice. You are so nice." Because he's trying to speak something. "Papa, mama." And mama is... Not that his words are complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When we go out and preach and we just repeat or try to repeat whatever we've heard from the spiritual master, but we may not have fully realized what we're speaking about, does that somehow or another reduce the potency of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> or the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, realization takes time. Therefore there is no question of realization. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says you simply repeat as Kṛṣṇa says. That will save you. The so-called political leaders, they have no realization, but they manufacture their ideas. That is dangerous. Mislead themselves and others. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is clearly said, <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam. Amānitvam adambhitvam.</span> This is the process of knowledge. These so-called scholars and politicians, they have no <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Instead of being <span class="Italic">amānitvam,</span> they're <span class="Italic">mani...</span> "I have become a leader, so whatever I shall say, it will be accepted." This is going on. Very bad. It is clearly said, as soon as you give up the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> system it is rotten. <span class="Italic">Sa kāleneha yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> So things which is rotten, what you'll get benefit? That is going on. Therefore in spite of so many <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> commentators, big, big leaders, scholars, not a single person is converted into a devotee. Not a single person amongst their followers. It's useless talking. Therefore it is forbidden. <span class="Italic">Avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ pūtam...</span> Because they are not Vaiṣṇava, politicians and-reject them immediately. Immediately. That is the injunction. I wrote Mahatma Gandhi that "You are so respectful. People have got... Now you have got your <span class="Italic">svarāja.</span> Please take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> seriously and let us preach."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Raj Gopalacharya in his commentary, he has mentioned that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> should be learned through the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> As Gopalacharya has commented. He was a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Raj Gopalacharya was sensible man amongst the whole lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was a Vaiṣṇava cult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I know. Cakravarty. So (indistinct), I say that amongst the whole lot he was a sane man. Raj Gopalacharya. Because by culture he's a Vaiṣṇava. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...agreement with Jawaharlal Nehru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He never was in agreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not a single item. He therefore resigned. He wanted to form his own party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who's that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Raj Gopalacharya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If they had followed Raj Gopalacharya this country would have been far better in knowledge. Raj Gopalacharya. That is because he was <span class="Italic">paraṁ bhakta,</span> to tell the truth, always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate</span> <span class="Italic">[SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore he was qualified. Anyway, if you are interested in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> how you can misinterpret? How you can put your own words to mislead people? How much misleading this is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually they're not interested in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I knew all these things but what I am? I have no position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But what you have commented is correct. And the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> real thing is <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Instead they directed their attention to <span class="Italic">karma</span> and this and that. It was and similar thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But because they did not learn subject matter from <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ācārya,</span> one has to learn from the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> is one who <span class="Italic">ācāra,</span> himself practices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. One who knows and practices. <span class="Italic">Ācinoti śāstra.</span> One who knows the real purpose. And there is no difficulty of understanding the real purpose. It is clearly said, everything. The process of knowledge is given, <span class="Italic">amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam [Bg. 13.8].</span> Where is that? In the beginning, "Oh, I am such a big leader, politician. Whatever I say is nice." <span class="Italic">Dambha. Dambha.</span> Because he's thinking puffed-up falsely. Some rascal fools give them clap. (Prabhupāda claps) They think, "Oh, I have become very great."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nowadays sir, they collect people to clap them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. They make such a speech and practice. One political leader, he is young man, he was saying in Hyderabad... He was ambassador in... That Rao?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, Motilal Rao.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he did not know. He said that "When I was going to be ambassador, Dr. Radhakrishnan, he told me that, "You first of all write a speech and practice it and deliver it very nicely. Then they will applaud." This is Dr. Radhakrishnan. They want simply applause. That's all. Because they know, "If the public applauds, then I keep my position. I am... Whatever nonsense I speak or whatever nonsense I... it doesn't matter."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Public support.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> That is their only business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Some of them, they don't even write their own speeches. They have a professional script writer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Professional writer and some speaker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All of them. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even the President of the United States has a speech writer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...learned scholar, English licensed. We know that Madanmohan Malhotra. In those days Surendranath Bannerji was a great orator. You have heard his name? Surendranath Bannerji. He is the practically father of Indian nationalism. So he was I.C.S., and in those days English scholar, His father was big doctor. Dr. Dugdhachandra Bannerji. So his speech, this Madanmohan Malhotra used to rote, cram, and before a mirror he would speak like this. "Oh..." In this way he became a politician. He was <span class="Italic">smārta-brāhmaṇa</span> and he became a politician. Simply by imitating Surendranath Bannerji's speech.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even those who are with Baroda Maharaj and all Maharaj's speeches were written by (indistinct) so one can (indistinct) These are your ideas Maharaj, "Well, everyone knows that I am writing it. It doesn't matter. I won't correct it." All the speeches given by Maharaj of Baroda was written by (indistinct). All, all, practically all. Here's a reference there. And he was a great scholar after all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. He was English born. His father was medical man. Dr. Madanmohan Bannerji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say he did not know even Bengali properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How he can? He was born in England. Educated in England. He was English-born.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then he became a master in Sanskrit. That is a great, I mean intelligent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be. He was a scholar. They were big scholars. He was professor in Baroda University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Professor of French and Philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is one hall, Aurobindo Hall, in Baroda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All followers of Aurobindo are Bengalis and Gujaratis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. No, there are others in foreign countries. He was scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> Bengalis, and Gujaratis will go fifty-fifty. There are some South Indians also there. You are from India? He had a very big following of Gujaratis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he was first in Gujarat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Baroda Maharaj, when he, when he did not appear in horse riding test, (indistinct) but he did not want to start the qualification (indistinct) So he came. So Baroda (indistinct) Maharaj knew he has came. Baroda Maharaj was in England then. He called him (indistinct). The same thing as the Britishers did at Baroda. That is, Baroda Maharaj was appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he was a person to be appreciated. There is no doubt. He had so many qualifications. But he was also doing yoga practice. When he was put into... No, after getting released from jail, twelve years. He was to be hanged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> C.R. Das.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was said that the man who was judge, was his classmate in Cambridge, Oxford, or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> C.R. Das made a very good speech. I have read all about what he practicing yoga in jail when he was himself written when he came to the minister's court. He felt that everywhere was Kṛṣṇa. Everyone was... He was seeing Kṛṣṇa everywhere. That was his feeling. So he would not be punished by anybody. But God is everywhere. His brother was transported to the... He was to be hanged and then he was transported to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct). [break] This is the fact that <span class="Italic">yato mata tato patha?</span> Whatever path you accept, that is all right? He said that. Do you think it is bona fide? Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mām ekam,</span> and he approves anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was a partial political leader also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. He's a political leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But then he had a great burning desire to see that India be free of British purpose. He was a real nationalist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That even cats and dogs, they also want that my cats be well fed and strong. That is not a very good position. And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says <span class="Italic">aratiḥ putra-dāra-gṛhādiṣu.</span> This is philosophy. And if one is attached to his homely happiness he's not even a man of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When Vivekananda came back from foreign tours, he brought three women and one woman was intimately connected with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, you have seen yourself. Why there was no men in America? He came back...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think he was a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> throughout.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know. There is an old man... Some old woman, he said about he's connected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Subash Candra Bose (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Marriage is good. But to keep illicit sex, that's the most sinful activity. Marriage is allowed. <span class="Italic">Dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.</span> That is not against.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Great number of luminaries have been produced by Bengal. Last year we read in Times of India more luminaries were produced in Bengal than any other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Bengal... They maintained the culture. But therefore I say that Vivekananda broke that Bengali culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bengali culture is fish-eating. Even <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They are eating fish only. Because Bengal is full of rivers. But not for all. Mass of people, that's a fact. But he introduced, "You can eat anything. It has nothing to do with religion." In Bengal in our childhood we have seen if anyone was habituated to take meat... Common man would not. Rich man. The rich men they have their <span class="Italic">sahis. Sahis</span> you know, who takes care of the horse. So he would cook in the horse shed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And eat there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Then he'll bring the (indistinct) and eat it. It was never brought within the precincts of the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) Gujarat and Maharastra (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no... These people who were eating meat, they knew that "I am doing wrong." But Vivekananda approved, "No, it is not wrong. It is wrong. Whatever you like you can do." Then they began to eat meat. Fish they were already eating. Meat and chicken and eggs and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All the sons of Vallabhācārya's followers are eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone is eating. I know that. Therefore our first regulation is you must give it up. Then we talk of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> My son He does not even tomatoes, saying that if you red color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomato was not taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. That is what he says. I won't eat. He does not eat because his mother was 100% vegetarian and we would not allow even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our childhood no one would eat the tomato. It is not... It is red color, but everything <span class="Italic">vilāti.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">vilāti begun.</span> So no one would touch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tomato?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was prejudice because it was brought from... Even potato. Strict Hindus would not take potato. Potato was imported from England. It was not produced... Just like <span class="Italic">Tulasī. Tulasī</span> plant we have imported, exported. Similarly, so many things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have not allowed <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> to be grown in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh no? Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mr. Shaheb, (indistinct) <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plant for his daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got so many <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Every one of our centers has so many <span class="Italic">tulasīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every temple we have got big, big <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span> Especially Hawaii we have got six feet high <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have (indistinct). They won't allow plant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is agriculture. You cannot take any plant. Not only <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span> Any plant from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You may take away the diseases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. Not only <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plant, any plant you cannot take. You cannot take any vegetables. There is agricultural restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I think <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> can be grown in all the countries. Even in cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Little cold countries with little care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> England?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. We have got <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You may have to keep it in hothouse during winter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We make that arrangement. And what Vivekananda said, that it is better to water eggplant tree. Why <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plant? What you will get? Eggplant tree means you'll get some eggplant, <span class="Italic">begun.</span> (Hindi) This is his culture. Make your body strong and stout by eating meat, and there is nothing to do with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The result will be the same as Gandhi's (indistinct). This slaughterhouse, so abominable and so horrible. When I first came to Bombay from my village and I had to pass through that railway, that nasty butcher house. It was so horrible smelling and those vultures sitting on the... I became spite of myself. When I came in Bombay. I had to join the grammatical college here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were... Two thousand years ago, Christ, he was born in Jewish family, he was horrified by seeing animal sacrifices in the synagogue. Therefore his first commandment is, "Thou shall not kill." He was so horrified. Why he has given this commandment? He was so much horrified. What is this? Therefore he gave up the Jewish religion. He started his own. This is the history. And he first commanded, "Thou shall not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the Jews were killing the pigeons in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very expert in killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't know how the religiosity could even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have misinterpreted religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> has criticized all so-called religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One patient of mine Sardar Patel, he's a old (indistinct) from Hindus and Muslim. And (indistinct) killing of their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Muslims are also restricted... [break] ...for some purpose. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> Actually, it is for satisfying Viṣṇu. Without Viṣṇu's satisfaction nothing can be done. So those who are desiring some material grants, they used to perform this ritualistic ceremonies. It is not for the devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> For devotee, Kṛṣṇa has said, "I am <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> and I am also <span class="Italic">hutam,</span> and I am also performer of <span class="Italic">yajña.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because he gives the intelligence. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless He gives <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> he cannot chant the <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> "Therefore actually I am performer."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ kratur ahaṁ yajñaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He says "I am performer. If I give him instruction, he does something, so he is not doing. I am doing. I say, 'Do like this,' and he does like that, then he's not performer, I am performer." So whatever <span class="Italic">mantra</span> they are chanting, if Kṛṣṇa does not give him intelligence, he cannot do that. <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ. Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everyone, whatever we are doing, it is being supplied, the intelligence, the everything, but according to my desires. I cannot do anything independent. Just like we are constructing, practically, with the sanction of the municipality, the sanction of the government. Independently I cannot do. Similarly, we cannot anything without sanction of God. But that sanction is <span class="Italic">ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> I insist, "God give me this facility, give me this facility." "All right. You do it at your risk." But God says, that "You don't do this." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> "What I say, you do. Then you'll be happy. What I dictate you do. But you are dictating Me. Because you are my son, what can I do? All right. Do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) "I grant you what ever you..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the position. <span class="Italic">Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām [Bg. </span>7.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Because you are rascal, less intelligent you are doing this but this will not endure. You'll be a failure. Better what I say, you do. Then you'll be happy." This is the whole instruction. "You cannot do without My sanction. But you are insisting. What can I do? All right. Do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I grant you. And take the fruit and realize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> He's there. <span class="Italic">Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">].</span> If you have done then you must suffer or enjoy. That's all. That is your business. You get... Now you have created a <span class="Italic">karma.</span> You have to enjoy it by accepting a certain type of body. Now you take it. I ask <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> "Give him this body. He wants to eat stool. All right. Give him the body of a hog." <span class="Italic">Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> The <span class="Italic">yantra,</span> the body is supplied by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> under the order. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate [Bg. 9.10].</span> Everything is there. But these things they do not preach. They preach unnecessarily nonviolence. From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> which is being taught in the battlefield, and Gandhi wants to draw some meaning-nonviolence. Immediately it is, what is the value? Not only Gandhi. Everyone. If he can give a new interpretation... I think in Bombay, was there any Dr. Reilly? He wrote some <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> commentary as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think it's not that Reilly. Not that Reilly, Dr. Reilly, but there is another Reilly in Baroda who taught...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who taught Sanskrit to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He has interpreted <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> patient and physician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Patient and physician. That may be this Reilly then. He was the dean of one of the medical colleges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So he has written that Kṛṣṇa is the physician and Arjuna is the patient. And he has interpreted in that way. There are 645 like that, this, what is called, unauthoritative commentaries. Without touching the spirit of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Best commentary is the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> itself. It needs no commentary. It is so simple to understand. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And commentary, interpretation required when you cannot understand. It is very easy and still these rogues will exploit and mislead people. This is... And perhaps, this is the first time I am pointing out. Before that nobody did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And you wrote I have read your commentary twice and it has become very harsh on those people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I must be. They are doing wrong thing. They are doing great harm to the... They are misleading the... If I become little more powerful, I shall do it more harshly. I did not show because I was non-entity. But I knew it. Now people are taking me little seriously, I am talking. [break] In the beginning I thought, Who will hear me? Better wait for the time. Therefore I wrote Mahatma Gandhi, that "Now you have got your <span class="Italic">svarāja.</span> Please come, let us preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You have..." If he would have given the chance at that time, then long ago this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement would have been started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He had only <span class="Italic">anāsakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has expanded his <span class="Italic">āsakti</span> from family to the whole nation. Expanded <span class="Italic">āsakti</span> is not <span class="Italic">anāsakti.</span> I'm thinking only of my family, and if I think of the whole nation, that does not mean <span class="Italic">anāsakti.</span> That means <span class="Italic">āsakti</span> expanded. I am a pickpocket. If I become a great plunderer, that does not mean I am not a thief. You cannot say pickpocket is thief and a great plunderer is a hero. The quality is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's that story about Alexander and the thief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Alexander and the thief. The thief convinced him, "Alexander, what is the difference between you and me? I'm a small thief, you are a big thief, that's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I will drive the car for today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. No, no, why you (indistinct). Young man... [break] ...the world... [break] (laughs) So similarly, if one is giving very important service, then even if there is some faulty thing, excuse. Service is so important. So in the Western country the woman can give very good service. <span class="Italic">Api cet sudarācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> This, our book distribution is the most important task in our society. Therefore I am giving so much stress and I am working so hard on this. Because this is my life and soul according to the order of my Guru Mahārāja. And by his grace it is to some extent successful. And I took it seriously. I take it seriously still now. That is my life and soul. I never tried in India to construct big temples or even in your country we didn't. I never tried. But I was selling personally books. That is the history. Sometimes they are criticizing, "What kind of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> He is doing book business." (laughs) The other day that, what is his name? Bachu Hai came. Bachu Hai Dresswalla. You know him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I know one Madanlal Dresswalla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this is... There are two, three Dresswalla in Bhuvaneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, he's also in Bhuvaneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe their father. In the beginning I had no place so I was staying with, what is that? Prem Niketan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Prem Kutir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prem Kutir. So they received me very nicely. So I was going to sell my books. So some of them were criticizing, "What kind of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> He's making business bookselling." Not the authorities, but some of them. I was writing book also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I saw the room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen? (Śrīla Prabhupāda chuckles) Who showed you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Hare Krishna Das Agarwal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. He was very friendly. Actually, he is the organizer, main person. He showed that, "Here Swamiji was cooking." (laughs) Yes. I was guest for fifteen days, that Dalmia. Not this Jayadal, his big brother, Ram-Krishna. He asked me that his family... He wanted to construct a little cottage in his house, "You can live here. I'll give you a nice cottage." I thought, "No, it is not good to be patronized by a <span class="Italic">viṣayī.</span>" This is not good. Fully dependent on a materialistic... And he's first-class materialist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. He's very notorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Actually, I thought he's good man, but after woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One them has lots of wives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Ram-Krishna, he's a big brother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's also dying now, Tejiyas told me. He's old now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. He's of my age. Not less. But he's after three, four wives. His business is to go from one wife's house to another wife's house and each wife's house, expenditure of ten thousand rupees per month. (chuckles) He's a very funny businessman. He has made his wife director and they take money. So to avoid income tax... So, huge expenditure. Each, one house. Income tax cannot say, "Why you are maintaining?" (indistinct) That is not their business. It is comparison. Just like Bhogilal, he's maintaining big, big establishment. So I became his guest for fifteen days. He wanted to stay. I stayed for fifteen days. I first, my requisition was that he you must give me exclusive typewriter for writing my books. So he gave me. And if I would have asked for typewriter he would have given. But I was working with my broken typewriter. I went to our Tīrtha Mahārāja in Māyāpura, that "You give me a room (Śrīla Prabhupāda taps on table) and a typewriter, (tap) and print my books. (tap) Give me some (indistinct) (tap). I join you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not say no, but the printing of books, that was difficult task for him. He had no money. He's hardly collecting for maintaining. And India, printing of books is a big job. There is no guarantee of sale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He must be feeling sorry for it now. Of course, he's dead. But later on he must be feeling sorry that if he would have given you... Agreed to your request...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These things I would have done from Caitanya Maṭha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I never knew... We never knew that you went to Tīrtha Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) No... Rather, it is Guru Mahārāja's institution. I first of all gave him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's head man. "All right. I shall join you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When was this? Which year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In 1953. Before going to America. Two years before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> '63.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> '63, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> '63 you were already <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. '63 I was in Vṛndāvana. Before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Before <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Before coming to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. At that time I was not <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> That means it was before '58. Somewhere in '57 or... So I tried my Godbrothers, that if they give me facilities for this, then I shall join. Otherwise, I will work independently. So nobody was able to provide me with this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nobody?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, they had no money. It requires money, printing of books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How did you manage to get your first <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> printed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From donations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Donation. This Dalmia, Jayadala, he gave me about four thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> H.N. Sharma always tells me, "I helped your Guruji print the first books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was through Hanuman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everybody is now taking credit for helping. Now that you are so big everybody says, "I did this. I did that, I did that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, actually, these Dalmia started with four thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're nice people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I met two of them. They were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He gave me twice funds. Four thousand once, five thousand. Five thousand he gave me when I went to America for the second time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They gave fifteen thousand about three months ago for<span class="Italic"> gurukula</span> in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. No, they are sympathetic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have promised that after they complete their building, their temple in Janma Bhumi they will give us money regularly. Now they are diverting all their funds to complete that building in Janma Bhumi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if we want management of that Janma Bhumi they can give it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That Janma Bhumi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we can't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Prabhupāda, I was just finalizing today this year's festival when the devotees come. I think instead of having a festival, a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> in Delhi like we had last year. We had one in Ludhiana and Mathurā. In Ludhiana Caityaguru promises that he can raise money for the whole thing. Our devotees won't have to spend a penny. In Delhi if we do a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> it will require an investment of at least twenty thousand rupees. If we do our festival in Ludhiana, book distribution I calculated will be as good and no money will be invested. We have a festival in Mathurā in Janma Bhumi. Every evening by buses devotees will go from Vṛndāvana to Mathurā. You wanted to have a big program there, you remember? When I was in Vṛndāvana. So we can invite different leaders also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Does that mean Prabhupāda will have to travel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Delhi to Mathurā. It's only ten minutes flight. Fifteen minutes. Vṛndāvana to Mathurā it's only fifteen minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Last time it was an hour. Almost three-quarters of an hour when we traveled from Vṛndāvana to go to that program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vṛndāvana to Mathurā is not more than fifteen minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifteen to twenty minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It's not more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We were at least... We were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we round about way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Usually it takes by motorcycle fifteen minutes. In a car I think we could do it in fifteen minutes. So I calculated our Hindi distribution of books would be very strong because Mathurā we can generate big crowds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You said that today we'll get another book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Probably come by tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets. </span>They finished printing it yesterday and they're binding it together. One or two days, it always happens. When I give a date sometimes it gets delayed. So I figured the distribution of Hindi books will be very good. Ludhiana and Mathurā and also not much investment will be required. It's very common, devotees go every year and they are tired of it. So this year we should concentrate on book distribution. If we have a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> in Mathurā every evening starting at six o'clock. If we can reach Mathurā at five for book distribution it will be nice. Actually I was also thinking of having a three day <span class="Italic">pandal</span> in Agra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Agra is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Agra is even bigger than Mathurā and our book distribution would be good. I'm going to write and see what the possibilities are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nearby cities we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that is what I'm thinking of. Near Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Away from Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There's that one man, he was very enthusiastic there, Mr. Bansalji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bansalji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From Agra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tire merchant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I don't remember. But Haṁsadūta and I went way in the beginning and later on he came during the Delhi <span class="Italic">pandal.</span> He met you and he wanted us to open a center there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Agra is a very good place. Very nice place. There are devotees. (indistinct) goes there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can attract a lot of tourists because Agra always has a lot of tourists. I'm thinking of having a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> there and Ludhiana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Delhi we had one last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching must go on vigorously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially book distribution is getting very strong with Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Preaching means book distribution. Now utilize here this flag ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Flag ceremony. Oh that Gujarati? They have a... When is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> On the tenth. Procession is on the tenth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do in such a way that that Sharma will feel something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only thing is most of our devotees may be in Allahabad. January 10th? All the devotees will be in Allahabad for that Kumbhamela and I don't think we have enough to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They can go after the tenth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> After tenth. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By fourteenth or by thirteenth. It takes only one night from here to Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twenty-six hours. We're thinking of renting a small bus for devotees because coming back would be a problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think Allahabad takes twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twenty-six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-six hours by train?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Calcutta it is thirty-six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another ten hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About thirty-six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Preach as much as possible. By <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> big <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> Big <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> is book distribution and small <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> is with <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span> Big <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> is going on all over the world. Small <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> locally. Overflood the demons' Godless civilization. Our declaration of war against this Godless civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I met a very, very nice boy yesterday. His father is a life member, but he's studying in Boston at MIT.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, technology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Very superexcellent student. But he was so submissive and inquisitive that he could really... And because he lives there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He qualified? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's finishing his Ph.D.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So he's very qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. And his father said that he is always the first rank in the class. Very outstanding student. And I mean the best thing is his attitude towards Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He asked for a copy of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's in Bombay so I invited him to meet you. Actually, he was so interested that the father became scared at the end. He said... You know first he was encouraging me to influence the boy but then at the end he said, "Don't make him a <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now he has opened his mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What's his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Shah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gujarati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> His father is associated with Bhogilal. He's a sharebroker but he's also a director in some of Bhogilal's company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Jain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shah's are mostly Jain. Jains are useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh yes. The father is useless. Every few sentences the father would start to break in with some speculation and the son would say, "Please be quiet. I want to hear." (end)</div>
