<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know everything, but I did not say anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> You knew him before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. When I went to America one gentleman here, Paramananda Mehra, he gave me an introductory letter. So he received me well. In the beginning I was staying in his care. But I did not say anything, but I knew everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> I'm sure you did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was his guest. He was receiving nightly. Of course, I was indirectly saying him that "You are not doing nice," but what more I could do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> I have so much love for you, and I said I must come for a <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> I was telling to the devotees. I said that you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are with Dr. Mishra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> No, I'm not. I was telling all the devotees here. I said Śrī Prabhupāda is the first man who brought <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> in the West, where it is needed most. Because there they are so much in the head, thinking, thinking, thinking. This path of love is so profound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. If you present a real genuine thing, it will be effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> That is why it is growing so beautifully, because it is genuine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it is the duty of the Indians to give them genuine thing. That is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> Before me, all these swamis and yogis went there to cheat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> No, they were afraid to give the truth because they were afraid they will not be accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not know what is truth. (laughter) Not afraid. Why? If one is on the platform of truth, why he should be afraid?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not know what is truth, beginning from Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> All the way, right. See, after you came... I was there in 1960. I started teaching yoga. But after you came I became fearless to teach <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and chant <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> So now we have lots of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> in <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> lots of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> And I paid that respect to you because I was afraid to give them because I thought, "They are Christians. They will not like so much devotion. They will misunderstand." But you have performed a miracle. God, Kṛṣṇa, has performed miracle through you. It's just very amazing, greatest miracle on earth. I just feel so strongly about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very kind of you that you give this statement. If we give genuine thing, it will act.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right. This is what I'm doing too. Everyone... We have about 180 people who live permanently in the <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> and they all practice celibacy. Everyone wakes up at 4:00, and they sleep by 9:00. And they don't touch even each other. They sleep different quarters. They sit even separately in <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span> Everything strict. No drugs, no alcohol, no meat, no tea, no coffee, no garlic, no onion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Yes. We are following this. But you have got any Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Yes. Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā is our Deities. My guru is Swami Kripalu-anandi. He is in... Near Baroda he has an <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> He practiced his <span class="Italic">sādhana</span> for twenty-seven years, and twelve years was complete silence. The last few years he is speaking once or twice a year because many people request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> He chants. During his silence, his chanting is allowed. Because when he says... When you say the name of the Lord, that is not called breaking the silence. So he chants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Silence means we shall not talk nonsense. We shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is silence. Instead of wasting time, talking on this material thing, let us chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is positive. And the silence is negative. Stop nonsense; speak sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right! That is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">. Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.</span> If one ceases his nonsense, then <span class="Italic">param,</span> the Supreme... <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.</span> When you have got better things, then you give up naturally the rubbish. So anything material, that is rubbish. <span class="Italic">Karma, jñāna, </span>yoga, they're all material. <span class="Italic">Karma, jñāna, </span>yoga. Even up to so-called yogas, they're all material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> You consider that as a material. Only <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is more... That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Karma...</span> What is the difference between the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> and yogis? Yogis want some <span class="Italic">siddhis,</span> and <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> want some material profit. Both of them are in want. They are not free from want. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> No, it depends on the yogi. My guru is a yogi, but he never demonstrated any power ever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no... Yogi, he wants <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> Yogis... Of course, nowadays yogis, they have no <span class="Italic">siddhis</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> (laughs) That's right. Even they don't have that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They simply say, "yogi." But the real yogi means they have got <span class="Italic">siddhis, aṣṭa-siddhi: aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, īśitā, vaśitā.</span> These are <span class="Italic">siddhis.</span> Yogis, if they are real yogi, then I can put you into the room, lock it, and you can come out. That is yogi, not by simply showing some posture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> That's right. They're the real <span class="Italic">siddhis</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing to control the senses. But real yogis mean the first <span class="Italic">siddhi</span> is <span class="Italic">aṇimā.</span> Yogi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> They can become smaller than the smallest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Smaller than the smallest. If there is little hole in the room he'll come out. Yes. Who is that yogi? That is yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Not today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is cheating. They have no <span class="Italic">siddhi</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> My gurudeva, he reached <span class="Italic">nirvikalpa-samādhi</span> seven years ago. Now he is going into divine body. The inner changes are happening, he says. And in pure body... The Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He said every five hundred years one yogi achieves that pure body. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">Santa-jñānesvara,</span> (?) They are lines who reached that spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu never said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Divine body? [break] ...and renewed and young again. This is what he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you become young, do you mean to say that you will not die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Yes, because then the body will dissolve, like his guru...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body... But you... You may get young body. Does it mean that it is guaranteed that you'll not die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guaranteed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> He can reappear anytime, reconstruct his body, physically or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reappear any... Soul is reappeared, <span class="Italic">bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">. Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So reappearing, that is natural. That is not wonderful thing. Everyone is reappearing. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> Suppose you are in this dress, and after one hour you come in another dress. So you are there. The dress is changed. That is happening by nature's way. It doesn't require any yoga practice. It doesn't require. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">. Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And the spiritual body? Spiritual body means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul. Spiritual body is now covered with the material body. So anything material, that will not exist. So body is finished; then he has to find new body. Just like the dress is old; it is finished, you take another dress. And when you haven't got to take dress, or this material body, and you remain in your spiritual body, that is called <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> That can be achieved only in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">. Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām [Bg. 9.25].</span> If you practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness then it is possible; otherwise not. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā deham.</span> Everyone has to give up because this body will be old, and one has to give it up. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> he doesn't accept any more material body. Then? What does he...? He's finished? No, he's not finished. <span class="Italic">Mām eti.</span> He becomes eligible to go back home back to Godhead, and there he dances with Kṛṣṇa. That is real <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> <span class="Italic">Muktir hitvā anyathā rūpaṁ sva-rūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ. Anyathā rūpam.</span> Now this <span class="Italic">rūpa</span> is not spiritual, it is material. And <span class="Italic">mukti</span> means when he gives up this material body and no more accepts any material body, he is transferred to the spiritual world to play with Kṛṣṇa, to dance with Kṛṣṇa, to talk with Kṛṣṇa. That is real... <span class="Italic">Paramaṁ siddhi. Mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] And so long one is the material things, he... The lowest stage is the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> the little higher stage, <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> and little higher stage, yogi. And the highest stage? <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yogī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti.</span> No matter what path you follow, without <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> it is incomplete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot go to God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> No, without <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa never says, "By <span class="Italic">karma, jñāna,</span> yoga one can achieve Me." <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ.</span> So unless you take to <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> a little advancement it may be, but that is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> It's not of the highest nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can take... You have taken to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> but take it seriously, pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...favorable, according to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> then he is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Pure <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">jñāna...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Kevala-bodha-labdhaye, kliśyanti.</span> Just to know things, if he's simply troubling, his gain is that troubling only. <span class="Italic">Śreyaḥ-sṛtiṁ bhaktim udasya kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye</span>. So <span class="Italic">jñāna...</span> This <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is to understand. Just like the scientists, they are getting some knowledge, studying some features, and what do they gain more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Just information and a memory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot give any real position. They are studying so many molecules, so many atoms, so many this, so many... They are mixing... They are... That is already going on. How it is going on? Who has set up the machine going on? That they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right. They don't know the key part of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither they can set up similar arrangement. They're simply studying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> They can study what is, but they do not know how it came about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So where is <span class="Italic">jñāna</span>? <span class="Italic">Ajñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> And it can at the most increase the convenience on the material plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāna,</span> real <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out. <span class="Italic">Etaj jñānam iti proktam ajñānaṁ yad ato 'nyathā.</span> What is <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> that is stated. But where is <span class="Italic">jñāna?</span> Everyone is <span class="Italic">ajñāna.</span> General people, they're <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> and, little more, <span class="Italic">jñānīs.</span> But <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is not complete unless he knows the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Unless he has realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not realized, no. Just like we are talking personally. This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam, ācāryopāsanaṁ śaucam... [Bg. 13.8].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam.</span> That is required. But these yogis,<span class="Italic"> jñānīs, karmīs,</span> they have no <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> They are self-made. Just like Dr. Russer.(?). He's self-made. So what he will do? Now he's caught up. He's in the trap. He's not a scientific man, but he presented himself as very scientific, so now he's caught up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right. You found it right away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's an index.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthairyam ātma-vinigrahaḥ, indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam anahaṅkāra eva ca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam,</span> not to indulge in sense gratification, not to dress himself as a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> as a swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Not external.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's servant of his senses, and he has become a swami. Just see how cheating it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> That's the real meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Swami means who is the controller of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Master of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Senses. So instead of swami, he is servant of his senses, and he is preaching as swami. These swamis go to the foreign countries. <span class="Italic">Indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> They have <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> to his senses, of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī...</span> A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> means he has ceased all material desire. There is no material desire. And the concentrated material enjoyment is sex. So if one could not control his sex life, then how he is swami? He's cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> That is the most potent of all the external attachments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the essence. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes. Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgī-saṅgam [SB </span>5.5.2]<span class="Italic">. Tamo-dvāram. Viśatāṁ tamisram adānta-gobhiḥ. Adānta-gobhiḥ,</span> by uncontrolled senses, one is going down and down to the darkest region of material existence. <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram.</span> So those who are sensuous... One should not be sensuous. That is also... And if he mixes with sensuous persons, then he also going to the hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right. One who attaches himself to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's also going to the hell. <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> So without <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanam,</span> without being under the control of <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> these are all bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> That's exactly what I believe. That's so true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Anahaṅkāra eva ca, janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are showing some magic. Just like this child was being treated. So he could not check the process of death. Neither it is possible to stop the process of death. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha...</span> Our real unhappiness is this-<span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.</span> So otherwise why there is knowledge? He does not know what is the miserable condition of life. Everyone knows that he is going to die. He has taken birth; he has become old; he has suffered diseases. Then where is the solution? In America this yoga practice is very popular, and they want some solution of the miseries. But here it is said, "Where is the solution?" <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi</span> is there. Where is your solution? You cannot stop death. Then where is the solution? This is cheating, that "I shall make solution of your suffering." But a intelligent man will say, "Can you make a solution of my death, of my old age, of my disease, of my birth?" That is knowledge. But they are poor fellows. They have no knowledge and they cheat. That's all. Where is solution? Solution is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> it is said. Otherwise cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Other is settling for the lesser, and it doesn't take you to the highest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they do not know what is solution, what is the process of solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right. Just taking care of the body doesn't take you anywhere. That's the lowest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may take care as carefully as possible, but it will not exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Amrit Desai:</span> Right. No matter how much you take care of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolishness. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> Then?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Because we are thinking of shifting to Hong Kong because our program mainly is in offices, you know. We go in office, and we dress with a suit and tie. So they're thinking that we're businessmen coming to buy something from them. So they treat us very nicely, "Oh, sit down. How do you do, Mr. Brown?" offer some tea or something. Then we immediately open up briefcase and present one of your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās.</span> Then we preach a little bit. We tell them that "We've come here. This is the first time in Chinese language, a very wonderful book. So many men have recommended." And then they appreciate a little bit. Then we say, "If you could help some little donation," and they give us. But these are mostly high-class men in offices, you know. So now we're kind of depleted, because ordinary men don't speak English. So we're going to Hong Kong, but there's no temple there. We'll have to live in hotels.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Yes. Prabhupāda, I am taking two books. (mixed Hindi and English)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we purposely did not have a spine here. We wanted to keep the cost low. You know you cannot get everything. If you want to keep the cost low, then you have to make some small sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (yawns) We want first quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But for Hindi books, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we find pricing is also very important. Because in Hindi and Bengali books, they cannot sell for more than a rupee or rupee, fifty. In English books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at what price you are selling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is costing us seventy-eight paisa. So BBT will sell it to the temples for eighty paisa, and the temples are free to sell it for one, one-fifty. So we're charging reasonable price, so we can go after quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if it can be sold at two rupees, you spend little more. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> That's what I said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I selected the most popular pictures for covers because people buy in India on the basis of covers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is very nicely selected. Both pictures are very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All the three books, I think, the pictures have come out quite nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are others also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> I went to the printing press, and I asked him "Why don't you print like the other books you have, <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets</span>?" So he said that "We have done little mistake, and the next printing it will be better."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not a mistake. We perfectly agreed. You told me so, that (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What will be price for one <span class="Italic">lakh</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of this? I think it will go around a velo(?), because the real book cost seventy-eight paisa; paper is about forty paisa. So paper, whether you buy one or one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> it's the same. Printing is about thirty-eight paisa. And out of thirty-eight paisa, plate-making and all will come to about ten paisa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plate is already made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying. No, I'm just saying by increased run how much can you save? So I imagine you save about three paisa, four paisa more per book. It's not enough to warrant extra investment. I have analyzed the difference between doing large print runs India and America. In America and Europe labor is very expensive. So to them, to stop the machine in between and start again, it's very expensive, so it makes a lot of difference. But in India labor is cheap. So for them to stop the machine in between and then start again, it's not so expensive. So the ceiling is not as great as the extra investment you have to put in. Therefore I'm not doing large run except where it's absolutely necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Items which are selling, that we can do because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we did one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to wait means that waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we're doing one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> copies now, and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is our first experiment with the paper manufacturer here. He's making paper for us exactly like American, especially for us. So I've given <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> First Canto, Part Two. We are printing ten thousand. Four thousand we'll print on this government paper, softbound, for cheap distribution, and six thousand on expensive American paper, hardbound, for export, because we will be able to export it for a dollar forty, which is two dollars below what Los Angeles charges. Substantial... So as an experiment, I only wanted to... I've ordered paper for six thousand expensive hardbound. Let's see how the paper is. If it's good, then we'll use the same paper for one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span> Before taking a risk on one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> I wanted to experiment on a smaller run.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> So I'm also thinking about printing again. Now we have just enough...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can print here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have very good arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At what price you are printing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Pretty cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hong Kong is very expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, let him say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Well, you know the book we have, six chapters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> It costs seventy-five cents, U.S...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventy-five cents. So multiply it by six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It comes to about six rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's costly. I think here it must be cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There're very few... How many color illustrations in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just take quotation. If you can, you print here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And if it is for export, it will be even cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can take quotation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. How many color plates do you have? Hm, 298, 300. Well, we can take a quotation and see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here it must be cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Have you seen the <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> we printed in India? Here are our samples. They're very good. Actually, I mean I'm not trying to be rude... Because I was negotiating the prices for the Chinese <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> when... You know that time. Sevānanda was telling me all the prices of the worst of Hong Kong for that time. It was above a dollar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yeah, I know, but that was in Hong Kong. We got it printed in Taiwan for cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Because he sent me for dollar forty, dollar thirty. I have the prices with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And this was... That was also for the corrections. No, the price is about seventy-five cents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Only thing I've told Jayatīrtha and Bali-mardana Prabhus to do is to open a letter of credit now because we are going to be exporting these <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> at export price. And the bank is giving our printer a loan of ten <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> So he has to show the bank a letter of credit, so I hope they send it, and then this will start rolling. End of February is our first shipment. We're going to ship ten thousand <span class="Italic">Gītās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Letter of credit you can get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I hope they give it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bank of America will give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (referring to Kumbhamela?) When I was in midst of the crowd, the crowd was so big that I was afraid: "If there is any rush, this child will be finished." Because if there is little rush, you cannot go back; you cannot go forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, if you go in a crowd.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very dangerous. And if there is some force, you become suffocated. So still, people were going slowly. By grace of Kṛṣṇa nothing happened. But same thing happened later years when Jawaharlal Nehru was present. So many people crashed and fallen in the river Yamunā and died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Drowned in the river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The rush came, and there was no protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We'll have to be very careful if we go to bathe in the river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now they make arrangement, section by bamboo, so the rush may not be very pressurable. Section by section. So section they go. Now the arrangement is better. But formerly the arrangement was not... It was open, and people come. As soon as there is little rush, pushing, there is great danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) Sounds like an auspicious place to die, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So I remember that day. I was thinking that "Such a big rush, forty million." Forty million, er four million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Four million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if there is little push, then this poor child</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">will be finished. We were going very slow, and we did not know. I like... I remember that, that "I have come in a very dangerous position." Perhaps 1928, or about fifty years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The reason for the Mela is because there was some drops of nectar from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is actually a religious conference. All the different groups, they gather in that holy place, and they propagate their philosophy, discussion, like that. India is country of religion. They know how spiritual life more important than this material life. That is India. Now they are diverting their attention to the material; otherwise whole India, they are for spiritual life. They don't care for material ... This material life is brought from Western countries, these railways, these..., so many things, bridges and so on, so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Factories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Factories and industry and export and import and then slaughterhouse, drinking, prostitute-these are all British contribution. In India, before that, they did not know, although there was Muhammadan kingdom. Muhammadans were happy as ruler. They did not... They thought that "Let them execute their own religion, and let us our religion." That was the relation. And Hindus, they took it that "Somebody must be government..." [break] ...policy that "If the Indians remain as Indian, it will be impossible to govern. Give them education and condemn everything Indian." And they engaged their own men, engaged our men, and gradually they developed the industry. Naturally people became very much astonished: "Oh, they are making such a nice bridge. We have now laid down the railway. We have got facilities, so on, so on..." They gave them, for developing these enterprises, a little knowledge in English, ABCD, they would get good job. In this way they established. Money and export, import... This business enterprise and industry, these..., all these things, were introduced. There was not a single factory before British days. Industry idea is completely Western. And tea garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I know Mr. Bajoria in Calcutta, he told me that in the beginning the Indians would not purchase tea because they considered it was sinful, and the British had to make a big propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, tea sets(?) committee. All the tea gardeners, all, they were mostly Britishers. They paid money for maintaining a department, tea sets(?) committee, and their only business was to make propaganda village to village how tea becomes popular. Similarly, drinking, meat-eating... And it became a fashion among the richer class to keep prostitutes, go to the garden weekend with prostitutes and wine, freely use them, intoxicated. It was a prestigious position to keep a prostitute. A rich man having a garden and one prostitute, they were... Anything in demand... I have seen it. Now I think, "How things are going on, that...?" You have seen that Mullik's house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thakur Mullik, Rādhārāṇī. So in their festival some dancing girl would come, <span class="Italic">vaibi.(?)</span> That was aristocratic, to call a prostitute and dance. So at that time we were children, five, six, seven years old. So persons who were of our father's age, they would sit down round the prostitute exactly like the street dogs surround one female dog, exactly. They had no shame even. This was aristocratic. And talking all nonsense, and if the prostitute smiles, they become very much obliged. She is (laughter) smiling. And amongst our mother's friends, they were talking, "My husband has kept that prostitute." And another lady... We were at that time boys, three, four years, but I remember all these things. Another lady, "My husband has kept that..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They were proud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our childhood I saw. To go weekend to the garden and... Generally they go with family, and others, they go with prostitute. With prostitute they have got freedom to handle. The higher... And not only that, during marriage ceremony, high circle marriage ceremony, they would participate in drinking, even men and women. Otherwise, in India, woman drinking or taking meat is a horrible crime. And what to speak of smoking? That is most shameless. That was aristocratic, drinking and eating meat... The Bengali, they were the richer section because others, they were foreigners. They came to Calcutta and earned money. And the Bengalis, they had their aristocratic families, zamindaries, everything in their occupation. So Bengalis were richer section in Calcutta, and..., four, five big, big families. And now they are finished on account of this aristocracy. So one gentleman, he was Harendranatha Singh, very rich man, one of the richest men of Calcutta. He lost all his estate simply by this extravagance. Every evening his house is full with guests every evening, for... What is called? That table?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Billiards?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Billiard-playing or some exhibition of singing, and hundreds of men will gather. And they were feasting, first-class food. In this way spending, spending, spending... And then prostitute, aristocracy. In this way one property and one property lost, everything. At last I saw him going by rickshaw. One day it was raining, and I saw that he was sitting in a rickshaw, and no friend asked him that, "Haren Babu, why you are...? You come to my car," so many. And he was friendly to so many zamindars, kings, and very intimate with... But they lost of everything, and nobody cares. His sons, they are of our age. I do not know whether living or not. But most probably they are not living. They became professional singers, coming of such aristocratic father. His father, that Mr. R. N. Singh, was a very good singer. That also was another aristocratic that aristocrat family-art, some art: painter, singer, poets. Just like Rabindranath Tagore. They became famous as artist. Avanindranatha Thakur, he became famous as artist, and Rabindranath Tagore became... They also followed the aristocratic family, Calcutta. Similarly, this R. N. Singh became a singer. Because they are rich men, they have nothing to do, so... And nobody instructed them how to become saintly person. Simply debauchery and... [break] On the whole the whole human civilization is..., and all the directors, they are not giving chance to know the value of life and how to conduct life. It is the first time, that we are giving the real idea of life. Otherwise whole world is in darkness. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatim.</span> They do not know what is the end of life. <span class="Italic">Adānta... Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> Vyāsadeva's real contribution... <span class="Italic">Ajānataḥ, lokasyājānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has given the right direction. And they are not taking advantage of it. If they come to sense some day, they'll read all these books, and they will come to know how to live life. That is our contribution, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The whole world plunged into darkness. They do not know what is life and what is the aim of life. That's a fact. Periodically, they manufacture some ideas, and people will follow, and then it is failure, and again another revolution. They are..., the Russian philosophy, that periodically revolution required. That is also to some extent. But why revolution? Take the standard. They do not know what is the standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means they're always imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imperfect, surely. Let us do something about it.</div>
