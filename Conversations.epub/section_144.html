<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...six or seven years old, my father was worshiping, so I wanted to imitate. I asked him that "Give me Deity." So he gave me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Did you wash them and play with them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Washed, changed dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Fed them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you still? Do you still wash them and feed them and play with them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now my disciples I have... (laughs) At home I was doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What are you reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> This is original Sanskrit. There are eight commentaries by big, big stalwart scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> These are the commentaries? And this is the text?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is text.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What does the Sanskrit sound like? Is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> to be chanted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like... I will read some portion. (chants a few verses, <span class="Italic">"tasmai tubhyāṁ bhagavate vāsudevāya vedasi" </span>to <span class="Italic">"vāsudevāya śantāya yadunām pataye namaḥ"</span>) Like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It's certainly beautiful prosody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, the Sanskrit poetry writing is very difficult. They have got rhetoric system. So many words should be first, so many words, second. You cannot deviate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the analogy and metaphor should be like that. Nothing should be twice repeated. So there is <span class="Italic">Sāhitya-ratna</span> in Sanskrit, <span class="Italic">Sāhitya-ratna.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu defeated one great scholar simply by little mistake. Yes. Keśava Kāśmīrī. Keśava Kāśmīrī was great scholar, and Sanskrit great scholar means he must fluently speak in Sanskrit verses everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Everything he says must be done in perfect Sanskrit verses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is... Yes. That is Sanskrit scholar. Not in prose. He'll go on composing verses. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu at that time was sixteen years old boy, but He was very learned logician. So the Keśava Kāśmīrī, he was traveling all over India by, I mean to say, competing other <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> other learned scholars. So he, everywhere he was victorious. So he came to Navadvīpa. And in those days Navadvīpa and Benares and Udipi and Kashmir, four, five places, were very scholarly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I have been to Birbhum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birbhum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I've been through Birbhum, yes. Navadvīpa also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when he came to Navadvīpa, that was the... In all other places he was victorious. So all the Navadvīpa <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> they conferred that "Nimāi Paṇḍita should be forwarded to talk with him. And if he is defeated by Nimāi Paṇḍita, then we'll become victorious because a boy has defeated him. But if Nimāi Paṇḍita becomes defeated, then we'll get another chance: 'No, you have defeated boy. Let us come.' " In this way they make. So Keśava Kāśmīrī was informed that first of all he'll have to talk with Nimāi Paṇḍita. So one day Nimāi Paṇḍita, boy Nimāi Paṇḍita, was talking with his disciples, students. And Keśava Kāśmīrī was strolling on the Ganges side. So he heard that this boy is Nimāi Paṇḍita. "Oh, I will have to talk with Him? He is a boy." So he went there, and when He was acquainted that Keśava Kāśmīrī..., "Oh, please come down, sit." So Nimāi Paṇḍita said that "I have heard that you are so learned scholar. Now we are on the Ganges side. You can chant the glorification of mother Ganges. She may hear and enjoy." So he was very learned scholar. Immediately he composed hundred verses, one hundred. And fluent, very fluently he went on. Then, out of that one hundred verses, in the sixty-fourth verse there was some poetic discrepancies. The word was <span class="Italic">bhavānī-bhārtā.</span> Bhavānī means the wife of Bhava. Lord Śiva is called Bhava. Lord Brahmā is called Aja, and Lord Śiva is called Bhava. Bhava means "from whom everything is born." Lord Śiva is the father of this Bhava. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "In the sixty-fourth verse you have stated, <span class="Italic">bhavānī-bhārtā.</span> Bhavānī means the husband of... Bhavānī means the wife of Bhava, Lord Śiva. So it is known that she has husband. Then why you say <span class="Italic">bhārtā,</span> again 'husband'?" He was learned scholar. He could understand, "Yes." <span class="Italic">Dvir-ukti-dośa.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">dvir-ukti-dośa,</span> repeating twice one thing. <span class="Italic">Dvir-ukti-dośa.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dośa. Dośa</span> means fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dośa.</span> In Sanskrit word it is called <span class="Italic">dvir-ukti-dośa.</span> <span class="Italic">Dvi</span> means two. <span class="Italic">Rukti</span> means utterance. And <span class="Italic">dośa</span> means fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Fault. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fault. Yes. So <span class="Italic">dvir-ukti-dośa.</span> So he was conscious. Then he said, "Well, I understand that you are a student of grammar. How do you detect this, this literary discrepancies?" "No. I am student. I am your student. I do not pose. I am not scholar, but I have heard this is told like that. From other scholars I have heard." "How could You remember? I cited one hundred verses and how do You remember the sixty-fourth verses?" "Oh, I can repeat the whole verses."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> (laughs) Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "How is that, that you can repeat? How is that?" "Oh, that is grace of mother Sarasvatī. Just like you can compose a hundred verses within a few minutes, I can, whatever you say, I can remember immediately." Formerly that was the system of understanding <span class="Italic">Vedas, śruti,</span> simply by hearing. Once they hear from the spiritual master, they will remember. The memory was so sharp. Therefore this <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> system is so nice. They can enhance their memorizing power, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Did Caitanya, did Lord Caitanya worship Sarasvatī? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He was Vaiṣṇava. But every demigod is worshiped. It is not that one should neglect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Oh, respect. He respected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I know one <span class="Italic">mantra</span> in Bengali to Sarasvatī. <span class="Italic">Jaya jaya devī jaya jara sari, kuchuku viśori mukta vihārī vīra nandita pulake vihati bhagavati...</span> (?) (etc)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Yes. <span class="Italic">Sarasvatī-stotra,</span> yes. Students are supposed to offer <span class="Italic">stotras,</span> students specially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So that's a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> for students, for Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Vidya, the goddess of learning, Sarasvatī. In our childhood we used to worship Sarasvatī: "Please, mother, give me pass this examination." That was our prayer. So other students, they laughed very loudly. They thought that "Caitanya has come out very victorious within a second." He said, "No. Stop." Then He stopped all these talkings, and... "So you are so... I have to talk with you. You are very learned." Ordinary formalities. Then he went away. And he was also great worshiper of mother Sarasvatī. Then he began to pray to Sarasvatī, "Mother Sarasvatī, by your grace I have become victorious in so many places. And what is this, that I am defeated by a boy who is a grammar student?" So he began to pray, and mother Sarasvatī informed her (him) that "He is God, my husband. So you speak means I speak. So how can I defeat my husband? That is not..." (knock at door) Come on. Come on. (someone enters) Yes, come. Yes. You can put there. (someone offers obeisances) Put there. All right. Put there. That's all. Very good. So then he further did not attempt to talk with Him. He went away, and the mother Sarasvatī advised him that "You surrender unto Him. That will be your nice role. Yes." So later on, he became a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, Keśava Kāśmīrī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Keśav...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keśava Kāśmīrī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Keśava Kāśmīrī, "Keśava from Kashmir."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. His name was Paṇḍita Keśava, and because he belonged to Kasmir province. He was <span class="Italic">Nimbārka-sampradāya</span> Vaiṣṇava. There are four <span class="Italic">sampradāyas.</span> The Vaiṣṇava devotees, they are coming one from Lord Brahmā, and one from Lakṣmī. They are called <span class="Italic">Śrī-sampradāya.</span> And those who are coming from Brahmā, they are called <span class="Italic">Brahma-sampra...</span> And one from Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is also great devotee. Out of twelve great authorities, Lord Śiva is one. Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, and Nārada. <span class="Italic">Svayaṁbhur nāradaḥ śaṁbhuḥ</span> [SB 6.3.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Svayaṁbhuḥ means Lord Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ah, Śaṁbhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Svayaṁbhuḥ. Svayaṁbhuḥ means "self-born."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Self?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Self-born." He is not born of ordinary mother and father. There was a lotus from the Viṣṇu, and in that lotus he was born. Therefore he is called Svayaṁbhuḥ, "self-born."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I knew a <span class="Italic">Naga sādhu</span> in Menakanika Ghāṭa named Śaṁbhu-bhakti Baba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṁbhu is another name of Lord Śiva, Śaṁbhu. <span class="Italic">Svayaṁbhur nāradaḥ śaṁbhuḥ</span> [SB 6.3.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is called Svayaṁbhuḥ, and Śiva is called Śaṁbhu. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇavānām yathā śaṁbhuḥ. Svayaṁbhur nāradaḥ śaṁbhuḥ kumārāḥ kapilo manuḥ</span> [SB 6.3.20]<span class="Italic">. Kumārāḥ.</span> There is a <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> from <span class="Italic">Kumāra,</span> four <span class="Italic">Kumāras, brahmacārīs.</span> They were sons of Brahmā. When they were born, Lord Brahmā said that "You now make, marry and produce. We want population." In the creation, in the beginning. So they refused. "Oh, we are not going to marry. We shall remain <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> devotee." Then Lord Brahmā was angry. "Oh, you are refusing your father's order?" So from when he was angry, his eyes became red. From that, Śiva was born. Therefore his name is Rudra. Rudra means anger. So when Lord Śiva becomes angry, the whole thing is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) <span class="Italic">Svayaṁbhur nāradaḥ śaṁbhuḥ kumārāḥ kapilaḥ</span> [SB 6.3.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kapila, Lord Kapila, the propounder of Sāṅkhya philosophy, he is also accepted as incarnation of God, Kapila. And Manu. Manu, father of mankind, who has given the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā,</span> lawbook. In that law it is stated, <span class="Italic">na strīyāṁ svatantratam arhati:</span> "Woman does not deserve independence." Manu has given this. Yes. This is <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti.</span> So Vedic culture means to follow the regulative principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So from Manu to Keśava Kāśmīrī is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I am speaking the original authorities. So this <span class="Italic">Kumāra-sampradāya,</span> he belonged, this Keśava Kāśmīrī, <span class="Italic">Kumāra-sampradāya.</span> Now they are known as Rāmānuja, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, and Nimbārka. You have been in Vṛndāvana. You have seen the temple of Bankibihārī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No. I don't remember. I didn't know the names of the places I saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have seen the temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah, I went through all the temples I could find. But I didn't know enough to know what stories were associated with the temples or what were the names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. No, worship is the same, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Only <span class="Italic">Rāmānuja-sampradāya,</span> they worship Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa because it is <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> from Lakṣmī, so they worship...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Nārāyaṇa is another name for Śiva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Nārāyaṇa is Viṣṇu. That is Kṛṣṇa's expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> According to Caitanya, Viṣṇu is an expansion of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Rāmādi-mūrtiśu...</span> In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is stated. <span class="Italic">Rāmādi-murttisu kalā niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatārān akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu, kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ. Kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ. Svayaṁ</span> means the Supreme Person. <span class="Italic">Samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo. Parama</span> means the Supreme; <span class="Italic">pumān</span> means the <span class="Italic">puruṣa,</span> the male. God is male. God is not female. The conception of female God, that is not authorized. <span class="Italic">Paramaḥ pumān yo.</span> So female is <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> nature. <span class="Italic">Parasya śaktīr vividhaiva... Śaktī.</span> So He has got many energies. The whole thing is manifested by energy, multi-energies. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-śaktīḥ parā prokta</span> [Cc. Madhya 6.154]<span class="Italic">.</span> Viṣṇu, the energy of Viṣṇu, is transcendental, spiritual. <span class="Italic">Kṣetrajñākhya tathā para.</span> As also this <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñā-śaktī,</span> marginal potency, that is also transcendental, that is living entities. They are also transcendental. They are not material. <span class="Italic">Avidyā-karma-saṅga anya tṛtīya-śaktīr iśyate.</span> Another <span class="Italic">śaktī,</span> another energy, is there. That is <span class="Italic">avidyā,</span> darkness. This is material energy. So living entity is originally spiritual, transcendental, as good as Kṛṣṇa's personal energy. But now they are covered by this material energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> How did the material covering begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> As the material shadow. How did we fall into that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That is very natural. Just like... (knock on door) Come on. Because <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> although <span class="Italic">parā śaktī,</span> he has got independence. So when he wants to imitate Kṛṣṇa... In the spiritual world Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, and all others, they are enjoyed. Predominator and the predominating. The Lord is the predominating, so there is no disagreement. There they know, "The Lord is predominator. We have to serve." When this service attitude is impaired, that "Why serve Kṛṣṇa? Why not ourself?" that is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Then he falls down in the material energy. There is no scope... Just like in the government system, there is no scope of freedom. You have to act according to government state laws. So long you are agreement, then you are free. If you disagree, then you are placed within the prison house. Similarly, <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> independent, not fully independent, but they have got. Because part and part of God, therefore that independence quality is there. So when that independence quality is misused, then his place is in the material world. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāṅchā kare.</span> When we forget Kṛṣṇa and try to lord it over something... And Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. When we try to imitate His lordship, then our place is in the material world. We are given freedom, "All right, you lord it over here." So here every living entity is trying to lord it over, competition. I am trying individualwise, nationwise. Everyone is trying to lord it over. That is material existence. And when he comes to his senses, <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> that "I am falsely trying to lord it over. Rather, I am becoming implicated with material energy," when he comes to that, then he surrenders. Then again his liberated life begins. That is the whole process of spiritual life. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya māṁ ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Don't manufacture ways and means, falsely trying to lord it over. That will... You'll not be happy because you cannot lord it over the material nature. It is impossible. If we try to violate the government laws, is it possible for me? No. If I am to live as a citizen, it is not possible for me. Then I'll implicate more and more. This is crude example. Similarly, we are part and parcel of the Supreme. Just like there is a story, <span class="Italic">Udarendriyānām. Hitopadeśa.</span> You heard the name of Hitopadeśa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-saha...</span>(?) From <span class="Italic">Hitopadeśa,</span> they say, <span class="Italic">Aesop's Fables</span> was translated. <span class="Italic">Aesop's Fables.</span> There are stories like that. One dog is speaking to another monkey, monkey is... Like that. <span class="Italic">Hitopadeśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> <span class="Italic">Jataka Tales.</span> I know in the Buddhist, <span class="Italic">Jataka Tales.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is a story, <span class="Italic">Udarendriyānām. Udara</span> means this belly, and <span class="Italic">indriya,</span> the senses, hands, legs, means. So all these senses, they conferred that "We are working day and night, and this rascal is eating simply. So we shall noncooperate. We shall not work." That's all right. Resolution was passed. So they stopped working. And next meeting they saw that "We are becoming weak. Why?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The hand wasn't bringing food to the mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they come to their senses. "Oh, we have to feed this rascal belly. Otherwise we become weak." Similarly... What is this position? These hands and legs are parts anbd parcels of the whole. Similarly, the whole Brahman, Absolute, we are all parts and parcels. So we shall cooperate in satisfying Him. Then automatically we become satisfied. If we noncooperate, then we suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, if you call Brahmā the Absolute, how do you make a distinction between Brahmā and Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I explained the other day, that the sunshine, the sun globe, and the sun-god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apparently the sunshine appears to be very, very big, but it is concentrated in sun globe. And when you enter the sun globe, it is concentrated in sun-god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Where is the origin of this image of the sun? Where is the origin of this image of the sun? Is this a Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstric</span> explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is <span class="Italic">śāstric</span> information. He is incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, Sūrya-nārāyaṇa. He is powerful. He is driving in four horses. He has got chariot of four horses and very powerful. <span class="Italic">Yac cakṣur eśa savita.</span> Savita, his name is Savita. The <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī mantra</span> is <span class="Italic">oṁ bhur bhuvaḥ svāḥ tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi.</span> That is worshiping the sun-god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you use Gāyatrī <span class="Italic">mantra</span> also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I know some of it. <span class="Italic">Oṁ bhur...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Oṁ bhur bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt.</span> This <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī,</span> this is called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Among poetic meters, I am <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī</span> is the origin of Vedic knowledge. Without <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī,</span> nobody is accepted as competent to study. That is the beginning, spiritual master, <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> second birth. First birth by the father and mother, second birth by the spiritual master, father, and mother, <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you teach <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī mantra</span> to your disciples also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not in the beginning. When they are little advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāma dasi:</span> Prabhupāda, can you tell me what you want for <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāma dasi:</span> Eggplant or string beans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you like. You give me four <span class="Italic">capātīs,</span> little rice, and little vegetable. That's all. Don't put much butter, ghee. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāma dasi:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Old age, we cannot now digest too much butter. That creates air. Although at night I don't take anything. Once I eat. And in the morning I take little fruits. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Mr. Ginsberg was telling me downstairs that the President is going to come to Ohio State.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Nixon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Nixon? President Nixon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In one month for the graduation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> He told the students to chant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa to Nixon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> So that he would hear it when he was coming by.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, I'll tell you my feeling was is I was thinking about it from a lot of different angles. I was thinking about it from a lot of different viewpoints. One is that there is a lot of resentment of the President and of the government here from the young people who are going to be sent to war or who don't like the war. There is likely to be conflict here when the President comes. One reason this place was picked for the President to come was that it is relatively..., many, many police around here, this part, police state, very heavy, so that it would be dangerous to show aggression and to show real conflict. But there is all that energy that wants to express itself, and basically peaceful energy. So what I suggested was that they greet him by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa as a way of manifesting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Very good suggestion. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I think it will make sense, because now there are a lot of students who know the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> So they might do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When he is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> One month from now. May, or is it June?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Commencement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Commencement. The graduation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In some lecture he said that "I want to meet some religious heads." And so one of my girl students in San Francisco, she is very educated. She wrote one letter to Nixon. And I have got the copy, that "Swamiji is spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is being appreciated by the younger section. So Swamiji will be glad to see you if you make some appointment." But he never replied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, this university he chose because it's supposed to be typical of America. So if in this typical university the young people greet him by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, then he may well invite you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No. I came here with this idea, that in America they are in need of these things, and they are wanting something substantial. So if some is given... Of course, I am doing my bit as far as possible. But if some organized things are done like government help or people help, then this movement can be pushed further nicely. Otherwise slowly it will go on, as Kṛṣṇa desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Mr. Ginsberg said he also chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa for Robert Kennedy before he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I think I told you about that, didn't I?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You told me in San Francisco. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So he heard two rounds of it. Okay. I have to take a plane today to a Catholic college in New York State. I'll be going back to New York at one o'clock, so I have to go back and pack and say good-bye to the students. It was a pleasure to see you here, lovely. So maybe we'll do it again in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I'll call. Thank you for your words and thank you for letting me join you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My... You are already chanting. But if we do together, it will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So let's do something together in New York City this summer. I'm free all summer, so it's at your convenience this time 'cause I'll be free. I don't have any dates or appointments. So if you just let me know maybe two weeks or somebody let me know a few weeks in advance, then I can come down from the farm, spend a day with you and then we chant. I'd be happy to do that. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Give him that garland. (end)</div>
