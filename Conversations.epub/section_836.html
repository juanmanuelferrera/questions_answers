<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still, he did it. Arjuna, in the beginning, thought that he should not kill. Come on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He's ready downstairs. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...can you think about the living pulse which is beating, the heart, heart failure? Why don't you bring it into palpitation again? If you study that air.... You are.... Air you bring artificially. Push it. Why don't you do it if you are so great scientist? Is it very difficult? So in anything, air is fi.... Just like in the tire tube. Air is finished. Push it, air. It is all right. So do you think it is air, the palpitation? You are so foolish? And passing as a scientist. Air can be replaced. It is difficult? Just like tire tube air, a huge quantity to work. You immediately, within a second.... So why do you say, "Now, now the breathing is stopped." Breathing is stopped, air stopped. What is their answer? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The cells have died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seller?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tiny cells in the body have died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't say that "Breathing is stopped. Therefore he is dead." Don't talk nonsense. Why do you talk like that, "Now breathing is stopped. He's dead"? Talk in right language if you are scientist. Why you are talking like that, "The air is stopped. The breathing is stopped. Therefore dead"? That's not a fact. So you are stating which is not a fact. Why you claim that you are scientist? That is the challenge. Hm? Then again you come to the blood. What is blood? Red water. So if you say that this, that, so many jugglery of words, so manufacture. Water mix with the red color and give these, these so many rascal things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They don't have artificial blood. I don't think they can make artificial blood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing. Artificial blood.... Superficially it is red water. So if red water is the life, then why you are spoiling so much blood? Keep it scientifically and push it into the dead body. I say it is, that way, it is the red water, nothing but red water. Urine is white water. I am coming to the five elements, air, water.... Then what is this bone? Earth. You can manufacture bone, hard bone, with earth or wood or something plastic. So we are analyzing the combination of the body, so everything you can manufacture. But where is the life you can manufacture? Why do you say? That is our challenge. All the ingredients of the body you can manufacture exactly like that. Ultimately you can give the beauty also of the woman or the man. But where is life? Bring life by all these things. Then I will say that you are scientist. Otherwise cheater, simply bluffing people. This thing should be stopped. Where you get the information that this, from matter life is possible. "In future." But in future.... In inceptive condition you show something. Just like formerly they were flying balloons. So because they were flying, they could say that "Future we shall fly a big city." And in the history we can see that that is not impossible, because in the inceptive condition or initiative condition we see that big things can be flown. But here you cannot even prepare an ant. You have not been able to prepare even a small ant, germ. Show me. So why do you say, "In future I shall do it"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some of these creature don't even have hearts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some of the insects don't even have hearts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how do you say? They have everything. You have no intelligence to understand. Everything, all anatomic physiology is there, even the small full stop. You cannot see even, microbe. That is God's creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen very minute, walking very..., exactly like a big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> In Vṛndāvana, when we were staying at Bon's place, there was big colony of ants. Ants, thousands of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have got all the sense, all the sympathy. For eating, sleeping, mating, they have got all intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What I mean to say is, physiologically speaking, at least from biological viewpoint, some of these creatures don't even have hearts. They're much easier to manufacture, the parts of their bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say there is no heart just like you say no soul. That is your vers.... I say that "When he is doing everything like a human being he has got everything." It is your insufficient knowledge that you say that.... Just like you say there is no soul. But that is your insufficient knowledge. That's not the fact. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna [Bg. 18.61].</span> When Īśvara is in everyone's heart, how you can.... <span class="Italic">Hṛd-deśe.</span> How you say there is no heart? That is nonsense, another nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So this is speaking of the material heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material, spiritual, you do not know anything. You don't talk. Better you become silent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe,</span> specifically said, "within the heart." The.... Even a germlike, what is called, atom, less than atom, there is heart. Otherwise how Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">hṛd-deśe</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe.</span> Every living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? And you say there is no.... You are our student. You are saying there is no heart. That means you do not carefully read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's there, but is that the heart of the soul or the heart of the gross material body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then.... Heart there is, as you have got heart. What you are? The same constitution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> it describes how they're sitting side by side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same constitution of the body. Otherwise there is no question of heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You've just challenged the whole field of biology also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the.... I say they're nonsense, rascals. They say that there is no.... And what is their knowledge? We don't give any value to their knowledge. Kṛṣṇa says clearly, <span class="Italic">hṛd-deśe 'rjuna.</span> And this body is just like a <span class="Italic">yantra,</span> machine. So as machine means, moving machine means it must have wheel, it must have sitting place.... Everything is there, machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That would mean that even the plants and trees also have a heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. That is proved scientifically. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has proved. There is a part(?). What is that? Spi...? Begins the word, the machine, the record?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Spirograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the word begins with s. Spirograph or like that. You do not know? They smear with black, what is called, carbon, and the fine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> Cardiograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cardiograph, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cardiograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sensation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the machine is called some special name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> The same idea as cardiograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Spectograph?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spectograph, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Has to do with light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, it records how it is moving, how it is going up and down. So that has been proved. The machine is hanged in the tree, and the tree is cut, and immediately makes a mark. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has discovered the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Generally at least, though, we associate the heart with an organ that simply pumps blood and oxygen throughout the body, but the biologists contend that certain bodies and certain species of life have no such circulatory system, pumping blood or even oxygen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, that's the contention at present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. But we can take that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Like a worm. If you cut a worm in half, both parts of the worm will go on living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You take one worm, you cut it, and both parts will go on living. You cut it in three places, and it will all live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So what is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then there's three hearts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Immediately manufactured as soon as the living enters. Their chemical composition is that, that even you cut a living entity, he can enter. The living entity enters through the semina of the father in the womb of the mother, the same process. Unless the living entity enters, the body does not form. It is matter only. When the living entity enters, then the formation takes place according to his mind. What do they know about it? Hm? <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> The matter simply is set up according to the desire. Just like we have constructed this big house according to my desire. The matter has not taken shape like this big house automatically. I am the proprietor. I desire: "Let the rooms be like this." Similarly, the material elements, the semina of the father and the ova of the mother, mix. It creates a suitable, what is called, cement, and now, according to the desire of the living being, he'll settle. Not that the cement automatically becomes a room or pipe or this or that. Cement is cement, the same thing, earth, water, air, fire. By mixture it becomes so convenient that it takes a shape and becomes a different body, a different body for the man, a different body for the animal.... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> A little crooked. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Mr. Mike Barron. He is from one of the television stations here, and he wants to do an interview on you for the news tonight, which is seen by many, many thousands of people here at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen this news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Yes, I've seen this morning's. Fairly similar, just to talk about the movement. Are you happy with the way it's going here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Just along those lines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> What do you think of that article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> A bit facetious. A bit facetious. I didn't like it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You liked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Er, a bit facetious. They had a funny way of doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Funny way, but it is very serious. It requires little intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Like to sit there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that this body is a lump of matter, and the consciousness, or the living pulse, that is different. Can you prove that they are not? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how do you say it is joking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Er, no, I.... The actual context.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The context is that if you cannot separate the living force, or the soul, from the body, then you are on the same position as the dog is thinking, "I am the body. I am a big dog. I can bark very loudly." And he's showing his capacity. And if we are talking big, big assembly, and in the same conception of life, that "I am this body," then where is difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> I cannot argue against that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point. That is the point. We have to understand this point. If we want to become more than the dog, you must find out in which sense we are more than the dog. That sense is understanding.... That is.... In Sanskrit word it is said, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi:</span> "I am Brahman. I am not this matter." That is knowledge. Actually knowledge begins from that point, that "I am not this body." Just like a big 747 plane is running on, but there is the intelligent pilot. If somebody says, "There is no pilot. It is flying automatically. The machine is supported," is it a correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> No. Does Kṛṣṇa consciousness make you aware of this, though?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, when one understands that this big machine is useless without the pilot. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> How long.... It's hard to say. How long does it take for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It takes immediately, provided a man is intelligent. Just like the same principle: If a man is intelligent, he can immediately understand that the machine is not important; the pilot is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> The same with the body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you take this body as everything, then analyze part by part. Just I was talking about breathing. People generally say, "The breathing is stopped; therefore the man is dead." And that can be replaced, breathing. Breathing? What is this breathing? It is simply air. Just like in tire tube, when the air is lost, you can immediately replace it and take it into work. Similarly, if breathing is lost, therefore the man is.... You can replace it. You are big, big scientist. You replace it. Just find out some machine which will <span class="Italic">"Hans! Phans!"</span> just like bellows. That's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Can you become aware of this without Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Can you without...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that awareness means Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We can describe it in different language, but the real thing is that we must be aware of this thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> So your teachings go much further than just being part of the Kṛṣṇa movement. Everyone, whether they like it or not, are indirectly concerned with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The.... Our movement is an educative movement to understand the real position of living condition, and then we act. Just like if you know your real position, then, if you act intelligently, then it is nice. If you do not know what is your position, what is the use of your education and acting? You do not know your real position. That is ignorance. And that is dog mentality. The dog cannot understand that he is not body; he is something else. But human intelligence is advanced. If they do not try to understand this fact, then what is the difference between him and dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> None.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is being misused. There is no institution, no university, no education system, to understand what is that living force, without which it is a lump of matter. Where is that education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> What do you call that force?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the soul, or consciousness. The same thing, the pilot. The pilot may be a small man, and the airship may be very gigantic. You can make still more. But the pilot is the same. So the body may be elephant or a small ant, but the pilot is the same. That is real understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Just getting off that, can I ask why you've come to Australia again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have already explained that, that this is my mission, to educate people to understand himself. They are under this misconception that "Every one of us, we are this body." That is misconception. You must know who is within the body. That is real education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> And how long.... You'll continue this until...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> ...until you die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The knowledge is already there in the Vedic literature, but there was no discussion, at least in the Western countries. So I am trying to.... We have got so many books, eighty-four books, writing on this science. (aside:) Show him our books. They are being accepted by high learned circle. [break] ...written not jokingly. It is a great science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Where do you.... You might think this unusual. Where does it come from, though?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> What goes into this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Vedic literature, <span class="Italic">Sāma, Yajur, Ṛk, Atharva, Upaniṣad,</span> then <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, Bhagavad-gītā,</span> so many. There is no cultivation of this knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> If we could.... If we put the stool up here, and then you can sit on facing that way, Mike?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How people are advanced? They should take very seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So he can sit and face that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Maybe you can take one picture of our books when you go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Yes, well, due to problems that do occur from time to time, we.... You know, what people consider to be the false guru, is that all right with you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, any.... Guru means the teacher. So if the teacher does not give you real knowledge, then he is not teacher. He is cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> And there are some around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Almost everyone, because they do not know what is the subject matter of teaching. The subject matter of teaching is beginning with this understanding, that life is different from matter. That is the beginning, ABCD. So if your basic knowledge is wrong, then what is the use of going further? It is all false knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> So there are a lot of these people who do that, false knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is.... That you have to consider, that it is a fact. And the yoga system is meant.... This is the real yoga system, that because we are on the false understanding, identifying with the body, so the bodily function should be controlled, and concentration or focus should be placed: "What is that living condition?" That is yoga or meditation, to find out what is the real.... Analyze this body and find out where is the living pulse. And that is real yoga system, to control the senses. The senses are working. Now we are getting knowledge through the senses. How to get this knowledge of the living force? That, a mechanical arrangement, that is called yoga system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cameraman(?):</span> Somebody move up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Yes. Do you have a two-shot, or do you want to get that afterwards?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cameraman:</span> Yeah, I'll get to that. You're going to have to keep my front out as much as you can. Don't.... (talks about filming)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Can you tell us a little bit about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, what it does mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the living force within the body, that is the most important thing, similarly, throughout this creation, cosmic manifestation, Kṛṣṇa is the most important thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Are you happy with the way the Kṛṣṇa movement is progressing throughout the world and particularly throughout Australia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, we are progressing very slow because the subject matter is so difficult that even big, big scientists, big, big professors, they are puzzled. So you cannot expect. But those who are fortunate and.... They are understanding. So this progress, we cannot expect a mass people will understand immediately, but if one person understands, he can act very tremendously to educate the people on this matter. Just like the example is that to illuminate the sky it does not require millions of stars. One moon is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> What is the biggest obstacle for people to overcome?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their dullness. They are not being educated, but they are putting into the darkness of ignorance more and more. That is going on in the name of education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> But some people are confused by the number of false gurus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you bring guru? You try to understand yourself. If you are fool, then what guru will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> But there are people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should be intelligent. You should know that what is the subject matter of knowledge. Why do you accept so many fools and rascals as guru? First of all you know what is the subject matter of knowledge. Just like if you want to become a carpenter, you should go to an expert carpenter. If you want to be a medical man, here, if you want to become medical man, you must approach the medical college. So first of all, what do you want? You do not know what you want. Therefore you get so many cheaters. You do not know what you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> You do agree that there are many people who do try and cheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all you agree that there is someone who cheats. First of all you agree that you do not know what is the aim of your life. Do you agree or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> I think I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> I think I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know? What is the aim? Tell me. What is the aim of human life? Tell me. We shall accept you as guru. Tell me. What is the aim of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> To be happy in myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, how dog is happy? Therefore I have said "dog mentality." You do not know what is happiness. You know simply by barking you'll be happy. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Well, how do I find out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is happiness? Do you know what is happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Perhaps not. How do I find out that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out.... But then why you are asking about guru? You do not know what is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Can you tell me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Your happiness is that you do not like to die: you die. That is your distress. You do not like to become old man: you become old. So that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> This is unhappiness. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> That is intelligence, that "I do not want death. Why death comes upon me? Where is my happiness?" This knowledge will lead you to understand what is happiness. But if you remain ignorant like animal, you do not know what is happiness, and if you think, "The dog is having sex. I'll have sex. That is happiness," then where is the difference, dog mentality and your mentality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> And Kṛṣṇa consciousness can help me attain this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He knows, "This dog's mentality of eating, sleeping, sex and defense is not my happiness. My real distress is that I do not want to die; I am being forced to die. So how to escape from this position?" That is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mike Barron:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have read that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> No, I haven't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he has written big book, Professor Judah. He has very much appreciated. And he has given statistics and everything, very scholarly book. <span class="Italic">Hare Krishna and Counterculture.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Ah, yes. Yes, I have read it. (background conversation-about filming? Machine makes whirring sound)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is breathing? (more background conversation, machines whirring, etc.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Your Divine Grace, what prompted you to start the Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, the scientists make research. One does wrong thing to do that. So our process is to carry out the order of the higher authorities. So my Guru Mahārāja, my spiritual master, asked me to do this. Therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But you led a rather normal life-before this you were married. You were a businessman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> What made you change suddenly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By this association. Just like we are holding meeting, and so many boys, girls, they come. If somebody is capturing the idea, he makes further progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> What was it that was different about your way of thinking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not my way of thinking; it is nobody's way of thinking; it is the natural way of life. Just like you eat. It is not a way of thinking. It is natural demand of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Well, why is it, can I ask, perhaps, that the Kṛṣṇa movement is the natural way of living against, say, other religions, other faiths?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of religion or faith. It is the necessity. This already I have said, that you are hungry, and you require some food. It is not a way of thinking, that "I am hungry. I require..." It is the urge. You are hungry, and you require to eat. Similarly, people are making so many arrangements to become happy. So this is also another way, but this is the right way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> You have now thousands and thousands of devotees all around the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> A lot of them are very young people coming into the movement. Do you think they really understand what they're going into when they join the Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if, if.... At least they understand something about it. Otherwise how they are sticking to this movement? They are intelligent boys. They are coming from respectable family, educated. Why they should go after me unless they have got something? That you can ask them. There are so many. All of them are young men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> They're forced to lead a very spartan way of life, though, aren't they? Why is this necessary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want real happiness.... That I have already explained. Real happiness-to become free from the natural material laws, birth, death, old age and disease. This is real happiness. Suppose you are arranging for your happiness, and all of a sudden death comes. Then where is happiness? So how you can check? So the real impediment of our happiness is stated: birth, death, old age and disease. So if you want real happiness, then you have to first of all make arrangement that you'll not die or you'll not take birth, you'll not become old, you'll not be diseased. Just like insurance. They make insurance of life. So where is your insurance for these things? You do not want to die, but you are forced to die. Where is insurance? This is insurance, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Insurance for what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No more.... No more death, no more birth, no more old age, no more disease. This is insurance. And therefore it is the primary necessity for becoming happy. Otherwise you have made arrangement very nicely, and if all of a sudden you die, then where is your happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Do you think the type of life that your devotees must lead...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> ...is in fact a happy one, getting up very early in the morning...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is. It is. Just like if you are suffering from some ailments, so you have to follow some rules and regulation so that you may be cured. Do the doctor not prescribe so many things, that "You don't eat like this. You don't do this. You do this"? There are so many don't's and do's. So if you really want to become happy, you have to follow some don't's and do's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Your Divine Grace, can I ask you how old you are now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> How old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am eighty years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> And do you think the Kṛṣṇa movement has helped you? Are you a fit man for an eighty year old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least all my contemporaries have gone away. (laughter) All my young friends and childhood friends, there are no more existing, my relatives. And.... So I am moving still all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Can you see an age that you could live until? Could you predict how long you might live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if.... You see, this body is so made that it must end, but before ending, you must be competently Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then, next life, you become permanent in life, in knowledge, in blissfulness. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Many people find it very difficult to reconcile the spiritual way of life in the Kṛṣṇa movement with the great financial resources the movement also has. Why do you need any great financial...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't.... The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement does not depend on any material condition, any material condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But you make a lot of money out of the sales of your books, etc.; there is begging in the street each day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But there are many beggars. They do not get money. We get money. We are not beggars. We are giving books, knowledge. Do you think we are beggars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> If I could use the example, perhaps, of your temple, which has a lot of very rich material things in it. I wonder what significance that plays in your spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what do you mean by spiritual and material? Do you know the distinction? Then I'll show you spiritual. And do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Well, the material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I say that in the temple there is nothing material, all spiritual, but you have no eyes to see to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> I wonder if you could lead an equal sort of life without the richness of the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can do. You can live at your home like us. We are giving the example. You can live also like that. That is spiritual life. If you follow the same rules and regulation and live like that, that is spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> You told me earlier that you make thousands of dollars a day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> ...out of the sales of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> If you want your thoughts to be passed on to other people, why do you sell the books and make money out of them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise you'll not read it. If I give you free, then you'll think, "Ah, this is something nonsense. They are giving free."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Not necessarily give them free, but perhaps sell them for a price that pays for the cost of producing them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when they pay for it.... When they pay for it, they will try to see "What these books are saying? Let me see." And if you get free, then you may keep it in your rack for hundreds of years. So that is not the.... But after all, we have to print these books, so who will pay for that? We have no money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Well, what happens to the rest of the money, though, that is collected in the streets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are increasing our movement. We are opening centers. We are printing more books. This is my books. I have made a Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. That is my will, and I have given my will that fifty percent of the collection should be spent for reprinting the books and fifty percent should be spent for spreading the movement. So there is no question of material profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> I wonder if I could ask you just finally, then, if you have a message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the message, that people are under the impression that one is this body, but that is not the fact. The soul, or the man, he is within the body. Just like you are not your, this shirt and coat. You are within the shirt and coat. Similarly, the living entity, the living being, is within this body, the gross body and the subtle body. The subtle body is composed of mind, intelligence and ego, and the gross body is a composition of these material things, earth, water, air, fire, like that, five elements. Altogether, eight elements. This is inferior energy. And the superior energy is within these eight elements, five gross and three subtle. So we have to study about that thing. Just like I asked that boy that "You can manufacture a huge machine, flying in the sky, 747, but why don't you manufacture the pilot?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Thank you. (background conversation about filming, recording)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is intelligence, that if in spite of your manufacturing such a huge machine, without the help of a pilot you cannot fly it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you manufacture pilot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Probably someday they may.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> At the moment we're just taking some photographs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at the.... You talk at the moment, sir. You don't give me post-dated check that "In future I shall be millionaire. Now you take a check of million or..." Shall I accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> No, at the moment we're just taking some photographs. We can't let you talk at the moment. You're supposedly listening to my questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> So for the moment I'll pretend to be asking you some questions for the purposes of cutting the interview.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you note down that we are asking that you are so expert in manufacturing big, big machine. Why not manufacture a pilot? That is my question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> As I just said, they probably will some day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "probably" again. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Oh, I don't know. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know. That is I say. Therefore I say you cannot do it. You do not know it. You cannot manufacture even a small germ, what to speak of pilot. That is the problem. The modern education is they do not know it. "Perhaps," "maybe," this is not scientific proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Perhaps they can keep you young.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> That's just what I was going to say. Perhaps they can build something without giving him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is.... Who is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> ...giving him command, a free mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So suppose if you say, "Perhaps I'll be able to keep my young age continually," is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? You don't know. Then learn it. It is not possible. You must become an old lady. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> How do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I know. You know also. You are denying only. You know that you shall become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> No, but I don't know anything. I'm prepared to not know anything. I'm prepared to wait and see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you can know from the experience that every.... Your grandmother was young lady some years ago. Now she's old man, old woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But, you know, you could use that argument and say, "Yes, but I also know that they weren't able to cure a single disease."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, if you say that "My grandmother has become old lady. I'll not become," that is lunacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> No, no, no. I'm not suggesting that I'm not going to become old. I'm simply saying that I don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore, therefore you cannot stop the nature's process. You are dependent. You should first of all understand that you are dependent on nature's process. That is intelligence. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi... [Bg. </span>3.27]. If you extravagantly say that "I shall stop this nature's process," that is lunacy, craziness. It is not possible. You have to accept that you are under the stringent laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Oh, I couldn't.... I agree with everything that you're saying about the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So but therefore how you can make a plan of happiness? Nature is baffling your plan. That you have to understand, "Why nature is baffling me?" That is real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> So your answer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> ...is to work with nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can do that. We can do that, that...</div>
<div class="Verse">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī<br class="calibre2"/>mama māyā duratyayā<br class="calibre2"/>mām eva ye prapadyante<br class="calibre2"/>māyām etāṁ taranti te<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.14]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">You cannot combat with the nature's law, but Kṛṣṇa says that if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, you can do that. You can stop nature's law acting upon you. And that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Why.... Why would you want to stop nature's law acting in its natural way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I don't want to be old man, but I am being forced. Therefore I want to stop this force of the nature. That is my natural inclination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Isn't it also your natural.... Isn't it natural to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is struggle. Struggle means.... Struggle for existence means there is something against my will, and I want to stop it. This is called struggle for existence. And that is.... The whole world is going on, that.... They have started that United Nation. Why United Nation? You remain.... But they are trying to stop war. "Let us struggle unitedly." So that is going on. You don't want war, but the war is inevitable. Even the United Nation is there, still war is going on. That is struggle. So, but they are not coming to the point of understanding that "We are trying so much, so hard, to become happy, but nature is not allowing me." This is real intelligence. And that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> If we remain dull-"Let the nature's law act upon me as it likes"-and we go on struggling to stop it, it will never stop, because nature's law is so powerful. You can never stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But why do you want to fight nature at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you want happiness. Again I am repeatedly saying that you don't want to stop your old age. You want to remain young.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> No, no, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> I'm saying I think I can be happy by working within nature's laws rather than trying to fight them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you are not working. That is.... That is your.... That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But I'm not unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.... You are not happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> No, I'm not unhappy. I'm perfectly happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is your ignorance. Nobody is happy. That is.... Then it is the happiness of the dog. He is also thinking happy. The hog is also thinking happy. That is another illusion. The dog may be a very big dog, and he can bark very nicely, but he is not happy because he has got a master. As soon as the master, "Come here," "Yes." Chain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But all of these people have a mouth, and you do the same to them. You call them, and they jump.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> That's the same as a dog coming to its master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But to have a real master and to have a false master.... Just like a physician. He is asking that "Come here. Lie down." He is knife.... He knows that he'll make surgical.... He agrees. But if somebody, rogue, says that "I shall cut your throat," he'll not agree. That is intelligence. A physician is also with the knife, and the rogue is also with the knife. When the physician says, "You lie down. I shall have some surgical operation," he agrees to ply on his body the knife. But he'll never agree if he knows that "He is a rogue. He'll simply cut my throat." That is the difference. But superficially you see, "Both of them are with knife," but one for real happiness, one for false thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> I find it hard to see the difference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you find out how to go to a physician, agree to his proposal. Then you'll be cured. Otherwise you'll have to suffer with that boil, always burning, burning, burning, burning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Thank you for your time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Give them some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> [break]...yogi(?). There are many animals. They are also doing.... (background conversation) And Garuḍa also, vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Garuḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Garuḍa. But he carries the Lord Viṣṇu. That is not the point. How to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, that is really.... To become vegetarian, nonvegetarian, that is not very important. But we are interested in Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> We are not in the group of vegetarians or nonvegetarians. We are Kṛṣṇized. We take Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That is our.... We are servant of Kṛṣṇa, so whatever is left over by Kṛṣṇa, we take. If Kṛṣṇa eats meat, we shall take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> What can we do? Therefore we offer Kṛṣṇa whatever He wants to eat, and we take the remnants. That is our.... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> so we offer Him. If Kṛṣṇa says, "<span class="Italic">Māṁsa,</span> eggs, give Me," then we shall offer Him and take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Thank you very much. Bye bye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They all take that this is some kind of a materialistic business, selling books and collecting money, and we purchase a beautiful temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I said that we are not material; it is all spiritual. That they do not know. Where is material? If everything is prepared and everything, there is Kṛṣṇa, then where is material? When it is misused, other than Kṛṣṇa, then it is material. Now, just like the university department and the criminal department. Where is the difference superficially? That's a building; that's a building. There are officer; there are officer. There are rooms; there are rooms. Why it is called criminal, prison house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The activities inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is the activity which concerns. In the university there is only activity of education, learning. And here, all the criminals are violating the laws, they are put together. But superficially they look the same room, same food, same office, same typewriter. So it is the question of understanding why it is called criminal department and why it is called university. So as soon as it is university department, that is good. The same building, the same dictaphone, the same typewriter, same table, same chair, when they are used for Kṛṣṇa, it is spiritual. The same money, everything, it looks like that. Therefore they cannot understand. The <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣavādī</span> and the <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī,</span> they: "Spiritual means these things should be zero." They say it should be zero. "No table, no chair, no house, no, no, no, no..." But that is (laughs) ignorance. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> The things which are usable by Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, if we give up them, <span class="Italic">prapañcikā,</span> as material, that is foolishness. That they do not know. They have yet to learn. It is Rūpa Gosvāmī's injunction. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ, mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgaḥ. Parityāga</span> means giving up: "Oh, it is material." So we are not such fools, <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī</span> and <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣavādī.</span> We are not such fools. Arjuna, he thought that not killing is better than killing, but Kṛṣṇa convinced him, "Yes, killing is better than not killing." Therefore he, after reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he took it, "Yes, killing is better than not killing." Generally people understand not killing is better than killing. But Kṛṣṇa explained to Arjuna, "No, if there is My desire, then killing is better than not killing." And that is knowledge. Therefore we have to carry out simply Kṛṣṇa's order or His representative's order. Then it is all good. Either killing or not killing, it doesn't matter because it is coming directly from the Supreme. And that is spiritual. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa induced Arjuna to kill? He was presenting as very good man, that "I shall not kill." And that's.... Actually that is good. Even if you enemy excuse him, that is very good idea. But if it is not desired by Kṛṣṇa, then it is bad. So our principle is: We have to act according to the desire of Kṛṣṇa. Then it is good; otherwise bad. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So in spite of advancement of knowledge, because they are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, therefore they are all <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ,</span> all sinful men. That is the test. So it is very difficult to understand this philosophy, but this is the fact. We are not going to be followers of zero-<span class="Italic">vādīs</span> or impersonal-<span class="Italic">vādīs.</span> We remain completely in the varieties, but these varieties are usable only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. That is spiritual. You cannot stop the varieties. You have to change the quality of the varieties. Just like we are eating. It is not possible to stop eating. Why shall I stop eating? But the quality is changed. It is <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like we're getting some money for our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The quality's changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They take that spiritual life is negation of anything that they're doing now, no more money, no more anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For our personal comfort, we, our students are lying on the floor. They are not using the money for purchasing nice furniture. No personal comfort. But if you say that "You are purchasing big, big car," yes, for going quickly to serve Kṛṣṇa. Our service is main point. If I can go and serve Kṛṣṇa within a minute, why shall I wait for one hour? So we take all advantages. After all, it belongs to Kṛṣṇa. They say that "We have manufactured." That's all.... But we say that Kṛṣṇa has manufactured. So they.... This philosophy, it is little difficult to understand by the dull men, that nothing is without Kṛṣṇa. Everything.... <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. Sarvam,</span> when we say <span class="Italic">sarvam,</span> how we can exclude this and that? Everything is in relationship with Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">sarvam. Sarvam</span> means everything. So how can you discriminate, "This is material; this is spiritual"? The discrimination is that when it is not used for Kṛṣṇa, that is material, and when it is used for Kṛṣṇa, that is spiritual. That is the explanation of <span class="Italic">sarvam.</span> Just like a thief has stolen my money. The money will be utilized. He'll spend it. I am spending, and he is.... Then why he's criminal. If you plea.... If you present this plea that "Money's for spending, so either you spend or I spend...," but that is not the idea, that the money.... My money means the money should be spent for my purpose, and because you have taken the money and spending for your purpose, therefore you are criminal. That is the distinction between material and spiritual. Money, or everything, belongs to Kṛṣṇa. When it is utilized for Kṛṣṇa, this is spiritual, and when it is not utilized for Kṛṣṇa, that is material. Where is the difficulty to understand? You cannot say that "Yes, I have taken your money, so you are also spending. I am also spending. So why do you call me a criminal?" The answer will be: "Yes, you are not spending for me. You are spending for you. Therefore you are criminal." Is it very difficult to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That last argument again? You're taking money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The money belongs to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you spend it for Kṛṣṇa, then it is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you spend for your benefit, that is material. Where is the difficulty to understand? <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1], ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">, bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> Repeatedly says. Kṛṣṇa is the supreme proprietor. So when everything is used for the fulfillment of the will of the proprietor, that is proper use. Otherwise improper use. Just like we have given several times this example, "Keep to the right," "Keep to the left." So you are driving your car. The will is, government will is, "Keep to the right." As soon as you keep to the left, immediately you are criminal. You cannot put this argument, "What is the wrong? I am driving." "No, because you have violated my will, therefore you are..." The government will see. That is criminal. So everything.... <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasā...</span> He is the proprietor. He is the enjoyer. So because you have enjoyed without His permission, therefore you become criminal. You are punishable. <span class="Italic">Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpam.</span> You'll see this verse.</div>
