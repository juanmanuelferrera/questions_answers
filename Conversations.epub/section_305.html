<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> February, six months ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. I went Moscow in...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> 1970.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Seventy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I think nineteen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Seventy-one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Seventy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> June.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> June.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That was last year?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Seventy-one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In April, I think, or March.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were there at seventy-one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Seventy-one, I was, I think, there. I might have gone to India on leave. I returned in March, the end of March. Because I don't remember the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I went there in June, 1971.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> And did you stay in the city, or did...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in National Hotel. One Madrasi gentleman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I remember now, sir. Abhiyarthe(?) Natarajan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nataraja, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Mr. Natarajan Rao told me because I was away. I was away in Central Asia. I remember his telling me. And Natarajan looked after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have heard something about our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> General, generally, in general.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All over the world, they are expecting something spiritual enlightenment from India. That is a fact. But our government is callous in that respect. Therefore any so-called swami, yogis, come from India, they gather to receive him, to hear something from him. Yes. This is the tendency, that... The real thing is that people expected something... Still they are respectful to India on account of the spiritual enlightenment. That I have studied. Still they go to India to have some spiritual enlightenment. And actually we have got this in India. If anything has to be learned about spiritual, then it is only India. That has been admitted by one Chinese gentleman. He's a learned scholar. His book is recommended in New York University. I forget his name. He has written in his book that "If you want to learn something religion and spiritual, then you must go to India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> It must be Lin-yu-tang, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Was it Lin-yu-tang?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yu-tang. You see he's a very great admirer of (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that's a fact. But our Indian government is not very serious about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> No, we have a difficulty, Your Eminence. We have got a problem in India because we have got this multi-religious society. So we have to be careful. But individuals can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Because we have got to be... We should not be misunderstood. As a government, we should not take too strong a policy about any particular religion, even though it is the religion of the majority of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. It is the duty of the government... Secular state means neutral to any kind of religion. But it is the duty of government to see that people are religious. Not that "Because government is secular, let the people go to hell."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> No, that's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you are Muslim, and, it is my duty as government to see that you are actually acting as a Muslim. If you are a Hindu, it is the government's duty to see that you are acting as a Hindu. If you are a Christian, it is the government's duty. You cannot give up religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmena hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ.</span> If people become irreligious in the name of secularism, then they are simply animals. So it is the government's duty to see that the citizens are not becoming animals. He may profess a type of religion. That doesn't matter. But he must be religious. That is secular state. Not that secular state means government is callous, "Let the people become cats and dogs, without religion. Government doesn't care." That is not good government. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I think, Your Eminence, there's a lot in what you say, but, you know, politics is the art of the possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, politics means to see that people are advanced, citizens are advanced, not that they are degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Your Eminence, I agree, but I think the duty of the government primarily is to provide conditions in which gifted people, spiritual people like you, leaders like you, can function. More than that, if the government does, it might probably even corrupt the religious... I don't know. Like an umpire in a game, you know, or something... Provide the conditions, provide the conditions for free speech. Not like Moscow, you know, where it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is... Just like you have got the Commerce Department. Government has got. What is the duty of the Commerce Department? The government must see that the trade enterprise, common share, or industrial enterprise, they are doing nicely, properly. The government issuing license. They have got supervision. They send sometimes, what is called, inspectors? Education. Say, for education. There is educational inspector, school inspector. They go see that the students are properly being educated in that school. Similarly, government should have expert men in the government to see that the Hindus are acting like Hindu, Muslims are acting like Muslim, and Christians are acting like Christian. The government should not be callous about religion. They may be neutral that whatever religion you profess, government has nothing to do. You do nicely. But it is the government's duty to see that you are doing nicely, you are not bluffing. That is government's duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Probably, as far as moral conduct is concerned, but more than that, how is it possible, you know? For the inner man in the spiritual mind, each individual can conceive his own philosophy, but the external conduct, the, the, what is called...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. External conduct means on religious principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> This is what I was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto...</span> I... You can, you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...understand Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ. Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ</span> <span class="Italic">[SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one has got faith and devotion to God, God is one... God is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Muslim. God is one. So religion means according to... Not according to... This is the Vedic conclusion.</div>
<div class="Verse">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo<br class="calibre2"/>yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>ahaituky apratihatā<br class="calibre2"/>yayātmā suprasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One must be religious. Without being religious, he cannot be satisfied. Therefore there is confusion, dissatisfaction all over the world because, because people have become irreligious. If you want to keep... In Calcutta, there was, in the American Consulate Office, I was invited. There, they have got a department: "Indo-American Cultural Society." Perhaps you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I heard about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was invited there to speak: "East and West." So I explained that so far we are concerned, we have no such thing as east and west. But still, there is difference between east and west that in the Eastern countries, especially in India, even in the remotest part of the village, a cultivator, poor cultivator, he'll understand God consciousness very easily. And so far in the West, I talked with Professor Kotofsky... Perhaps you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes. In Oriental Institute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He said, "Swamiji, after this body's finished, everything is finished." You see? Such a big professor. He...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That is Marxist materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> It is Marxist materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Marxist materialism, does it mean a congregation of some fools and rascals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I think so, true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Does it mean they like that some congregation of fools and rascals? Such a big professor, he does not know, he cannot understand even that there is life after death. He has to accept another body. As we are accepting different bodies. I was a child. You were a child. Then I became a boy. That is different body. Different consciousness also. A child, three-four years, he talks in a different way. A boy, ten-twelve years, he talks in a different way, and a young man, educated young man, he talks in a different way. So with the change of the body, the consciousness is changing. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Children, small children, they're just like animals. The cats and dogs, just they are playing, they're also playing like that. But he, he does not belong to that category because when he'll get..., he'll get another body in which he'll be intelligent. Another body, he'll be highly educated. Another body, he'll be doctorate. The cats and dogs, they'll have to wait to get that body. So with the body, we are changing our consciousness. So different body, different consciousness. Similarly, why not after death a different body, different consciousness? If you make progress. Yes. This is progressive. So that is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So people cannot understand. That means they are not <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> not even, according to Vedic conc..., not even gentlemen. One who cannot understand this simple theory, that, "After this body, as I have changed so many bodies, similarly, I shall change this body also." That's a fact. So <span class="Italic">dhīras tatra na muhyati. Dhīra,</span> one who has got brain, one who can think, he'll not be puzzled. "Yes, he has... Death means he has changed body." Any gentle, good brain will understand. But people are so foolish now, they cannot understand. They are not educated even to understand this simple thing. This is the position of the world. Even a big professor like Kotofsky. So this is the position of our present human society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> But in the countries like Moscow, Soviet Union, they are hostile, against it, but in most countries of the world, they're indifferent. It's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why Moscow? Everywhere. Moscow, they are, rather, good that they say, "We don't believe in God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's true, that's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But others, they say that "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Christian," "I believe in God," but he does not know anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'm afraid most of us are like that, to be honest. That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) I should say that Moscow are gentlemen. Because they cannot understand, they say, "Don't believe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> It's <span class="Italic">mūḍha-dhī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But these rascals, they say, "Yes, I'm religious," but he's doing most irreligious activities. You see? I asked the Christian so many times that "Your Bible says, 'Thou shalt not kill.' Why you are killing?" They cannot give any satisfactory answer. This is my experience. It is clearly said, "Thou shalt not kill." And they are maintaining slaughterhouses. What is this? The other day in London, one lady, she was showing me... She... You were present? Broke some grass blade?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh yes, I was present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Breaking a grass blade is equal to keeping a big, organized slaughterhouse. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their intelligence. She has complained, "It is also killing." Supposing it is killing. Actually it is not killing. Supposing it is killing. This killing and keeping organized slaughterhouse killing is the same thing. Just see. People have become so degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> This is sophistry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They give this example that: "You also kill vegetables, just this grass blade is broken. It is killed. So it is equal to maintaining a big slaughterhouse." You see? This is going on, under the name of re... They, they were Christian nuns. In London they come to me, talk some time. So... And in India also, we see now cow killing is going on, regular slaughterhouse and... What can I say? You are government man. (laughs) You may take some wrong views about me. What is your opinion, personal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'm afraid I'm a very democratic person. If people, if they sincerely believe that they cannot exist without meat, they should be permitted, and once that is granted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> ...you have to organize slaughterhouses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, then that is the, our misfortune that we have lost our Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Your Grace, what you want is really a sort of complete...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> ...a strong, obedient, disciplined society. But the moment the disciplinarian becomes a dictator, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is, it is the duty of the government to see. That is the government. Strong government means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> It's the <span class="Italic">Rāma-rājya</span> ideal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Strong government means that, that government should be very, very vigilant that citizens are doing their duty properly. That is the first duty. They should be given all protection. At the same time... Just like the father gives protection to the children, at the same time, very strict that they are morally and disciplinary, they are going, coming out nice. That is father's duty. It is government's duty. If the father thinks, "Let my son go to hell. I don't care. I give them some food. That's all." Is that father's duty? No. Father's duty, to arrange for their food, for their dress, for their shelter, at the same time, to see that they are growing nice, not rascals. That is father's duty. Similarly, government's duty is that. We see from Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> government duty is that. Otherwise why there is need of government? Government... Now it is government. But formerly it was the king. The king must be representative of God. Because... Who is God? God means <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām, eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">. Kaṭhopaniṣad.</span> So God, what is God? God means He's also person. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.</span> He is also eternal, He's also cognizant. We are also eternal, we are also cognizant. But what is the difference between God and we? The difference is He maintains us. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān. Bahu-vacanam, nityānām, cetanānām,</span> this is <span class="Italic">bahu-vacanam.</span> And <span class="Italic">nityaḥ, cetanaḥ, eka-vacanam.</span> So what is the difference between this singular number and plural number? The singular number is maintaining the plural number. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> So God is maintaining everyone. So difference is that He is so powerful, He can maintain every living entity. He's maintaining the elephants in Africa, who eat, at a time, forty kilos. He's supplying food. There's no scarcity of food in the jungle for the elephants. Neither there is scarcity... In the hole of your room, you'll find hundreds and thousands of <span class="Italic">ui.</span> Who is feeding them, within the hole? Unless they're eating, sleeping, the same thing are there. How they are living very nicely? But who is giving them food within the hole? A small hole. You did not provide that hole. You did not provide their food. But there are hundreds and millions of ants. They're living there within the hole very happily. Sometimes they come out. We see: "Oh, wherefrom so many hundreds coming?" So <span class="Italic">eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That is God. He's supplying food. So there are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities. Out of that, 400,000 are human beings. Out of that, many are uncivilized. The uncivilized aborigines live in the jungle. They have no economic problem. They're also human being. They never come to city for food. They are maintaining themselves. The elephants are maintaining. The ants are maintaining. Why the civilized, a few men, they have got so problem, so many problems? Because they... We are not the only living entities. There are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities. They're all being maintained by the Supreme Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ:</span> [Bg. 14.4] "As many forms are there, in all different species," <span class="Italic">ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā,</span> "I am the Father." The father maintains the sons, as we see actually. He's maintaining. So why you are so much...? Our father is rich. He's not poor. God is not poor. <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa.</span> Six kinds of opulence fully. So why are you talking of this over-population, scarcity of food? Why? Actually the father is God. He's maintaining. And factually we see how many human beings, civilized human beings, are there. The other living beings are many hundred thousand times bigger quantity. If they can be maintained by God, what we have done, that He'll not maintain us? He'll maintain us. He's maintaining. So many people they say, "India is starving." I am Indian. I never see any man starving and died. I've never seen. This is simply advertisement. What is your opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> There is poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> There is poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Poverty, there is poverty in other countries also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There, there also... Now India has got poverty. So why in America and Europe, there are hippies. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> It's an express... It's another type of poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're also thinking that "We are not sumptuously fed," or something. Some demands is there. Some demand. And they are lying down, Amsterdam and here, on the street. And why? But they are coming of rich families, rich nation. Especially America. In London also, I have seen. Regent Park. They're lying down. Police is kicking. Police is kicking: "Get up, get up!" Why? Behind them the British Empire is, British government is there. Why he's lying down there? Who has told him to...? Government is requesting, "If you have no home, come on. I shall give you home." In Bombay also, these, what is called? The huts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Huts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Those tent huts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are on the... You have seen in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We passed, when we passed while coming from aerodrome to city...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> From...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many thatched cottages, small. So Bombay government has given them home, that "You come here, live." But what do they...? they rent to some, another man, and they live in the... In Madras also, I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I know. That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They don't like. They don't like. They want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> They roam, yes. It's what the gypsies did, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> When they were given houses in Moscow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there are different <span class="Italic">prakṛtis. Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there are different <span class="Italic">prakṛtis,</span> different mentality. They want to live, eat. The eating, sleeping, mating, defending is there, but everyone has got different ideas. Just like you say, majority of people, they want to eat meat. They have got different mentality.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Most of them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mostly they are vegetarian, strictly vegetarian. Actually, in Southern India, they maintain the Hindu culture. You'll find big high-court judges, they have got <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Strictly in Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> or Śaiva <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> they have got... Strictly taking bath and <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> In New Delhi, you'll find so many Madrasi gentlemen, big, big, high officers, they're strictly following Hindu principles.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still, if I am correct, in Madras, they, there, there is not many Mohammedans. The Mohammedan culture could not enter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's very true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...into Madras, Southern India. And you'll find also in our Caitanya Caritāmṛta... Now I am translating. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Southern India, practically whole Southern India became Vaiṣṇava by His preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> It is a great period of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. And all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they came from South India. Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya. I think Madhvācārya belonged to your province? Malaya?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> From Kerala. Sir, I have got a question. I have not really been able to locate when exactly Rādhā entered Hindu mythology. Because the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> doesn't mention. They mention only <span class="Italic">rāsa-krīḍā</span> as a... Before that, they were, before Gaurāṅga, Caitanya, did you, do you have rendered exactly the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult to take... The Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, I mean. They were generally the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they elevated people up to <span class="Italic">sākhya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> <span class="Italic">Sākhya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He gave us <span class="Italic">mādhurya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> <span class="Italic">Mādhurya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore about Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it is said, <span class="Italic">anarpita-carīṁ cirāt. Anarpita-carīṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasāṁ...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> <span class="Italic">Anayārādhitaḥ?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I do not know what we can do here, Your Grace, but we will be very happy to help them if they want any special material like dahl or any vegetables or... whatever it is... I think they are quite well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We, we, we have no fixed income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa has given us opportunity. Our books are selling... You have seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I've seen them in Moscow. One gentleman had a complete set. So I have glanced through them. Especially the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> ...translation, yes. And also the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, this one, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is published by Macmillan Company. We are selling about more than one lakh copies per year through Macmillan Company. Yes. Similarly, we are selling our other books. Bring...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> The complete set I have seen. And also the other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not yet complete. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> will be finished in sixty volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, sixty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have published only six volumes. Our manuscript is ready, but it requires great amount of money to publish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> And also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are satisfied that in English-reading public, in Australia and America, in England, Europe-we are publishing in different languages-people are accepting our books very nicely. And lately that, one distributor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This. No, not this. Where is that catalog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Brockridge, Keenan and Hall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Catalog? I think we must have left that in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are also distributing our books, Macmillan Company. People are... Now there will be a big meeting on the 12th, September, how to organize. Because this kind of literature was there, there was none before this. The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, this was never presented to the western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, yes. Mostly it was Vivekananda's explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vivekananda did not know anything about <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> No, I mean he just, literally, it's not <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> at all. Yes, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither Vivekananda nor any swami. That is the regrettable fact. They, actually... Even Dr. Radhakrishnan, he could not present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. You see? He's impersonalist, and he presented in a different way, and now Professor, Dr. Pirindher...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Philinder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Dillinger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said, he came to see me that "Now we have rejected Dr. Radhakrishnan."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because everyone has speculated in his own way. Therefore we have presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> And if you have got time, we can read some of the portions, how we have presented as it is. So people are liking this <span class="Italic">As It Is.</span> Otherwise, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is well-known in the western country, all over Europe. But because it was not presented as it is, there was not a single devotee of Kṛṣṇa. You find out, the whole history. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is meant for making the reader a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So who can become fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa unless he's a devotee? So it is a transaction between God and His devotee. That's a fact. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the clear declaration. He's asking everyone, "Just become My devotee. Always think of Me. Offer Me obeisances." <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī.</span> "Worship Me." <span class="Italic">Māṁ namaskuru.</span> He, He is deprecating the worship of demigods. <span class="Italic">Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]<span class="Italic">. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām: [Bg. </span>7.23] "Less intelligent persons, they simply worship the demigods." This is the statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Most of... Well, I mean, I was a very political person. I must be very honest with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm talking of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> To me, <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> means Gandhi's <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> which said in a very distorted, very limited version...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gandhi did not know anything about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> (laughs) I understand him best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, you... Gandhi may give his opinion, but why he should give through <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I know. <span class="Italic">Anāsakta-yoga</span> is really...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He should not take advantage of... That is being done. Everyone is taking advantage of the popularity of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and he's expressing his own opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. We want to stop this nonsense. If you have got opinion, you write different book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes. But not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you should misuse <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> The devil can quote the scripture for his purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's what Shakespeare said, sir, "The devil can quote the scripture for his purpose."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Yes. That's a fact. Yes, why you should try to introduce your philosophy... Now, say, for Gandhi's non-violence. Where is non-violence in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> (laughs.) It's... Yeah, this is true. <span class="Italic">Ahiṁsā paramo dharmaḥ, dharmo 'hiṁsā tathaiva ca.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our, our point is that you may express your own op... Everyone has got right to... Especially Mahatma Gandhi, he was actually a great personality. There is no doubt about it. But so far <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is concerned, he did not know anything. But from his behavior, it was seen that at heart he was a devotee. Yes. At heart he was a devotee. Yes. Because he was chanting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, of course, he, of course, shares with you this belief in chants. That we noticed, yes, very much in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">raghupati rāghava rājā rāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So that... But maybe for politics, he has explained like that. Now what is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>taṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya<br class="calibre2"/>prakṛtyā niyatāḥ svayā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.20]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Next verse.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also <span class="Italic">kāmān.</span> Whatever benediction they get, that is sanctioned by Kṛṣṇa. They cannot give it independently. You can keep it here. These six volumes are already published.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, I see, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, uh, no, this is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Whatever might be the difference of opinion about the, you know, the subtleties, you see, this itself is very great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have given each meaning of... You can see the Sanskrit verse, how we have explained. Here and in America especially, as soon as they see, they purchase the whole set. Six copies. See.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's on the 11th. Eleventh morning we're leaving, back to London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Back to London. And you'll be visiting only Sweden this time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Not Copenhagen or Oslo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda attem... He traveled to Paris, and also, previously, to Amsterdam and Germany, in years previously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> This temple is going to be a permanent situation, this particular building, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Or somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In the beginning stage, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, then you'll have to locate something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So practically single-handed I am trying to give this original Indian culture to the world. And nobody's helping me. Neither, if some rich man wants to help me, government will not allow to help me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, yes, especially...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now just like Sir Padampat Singhania of Kanpur, he promised that, "You just construct a nice temple in New York." He wanted to give the money. The government will not allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, foreign exchange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not allow. I made correspondence with the government. The last reply was that "You can raise fund locally, but you cannot take money from here." Now who will pay...? Of course, these boys are paying me. We are getting... Now recently, one boy, you know his name, George Harrison. He's a very famous singer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has purchased for me one house, fifty-five lakhs worth. But what, no Indian could help me. At two hundred and twenty thousand pounds. So it is equivalent to fifty-five lakhs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> But I'm told that you have fifty-five temples in the west...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why fifty? More than fifty... In U.S.A. we have got about fifty temples. And Australia, also, we have got five temples. And Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Perth.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we had very gorgeous Ratha-yātrā ceremony in Australia. In London also. You know that? Ten thousand people participated, and we distributed <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> On the 12th you'll have it in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> This big meeting will be in London, on the 12th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That is another meeting. Our Ratha-yātrā is held on July 8th in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> July 8th. And simultaneously in San Francisco and in Sydney, all over the world.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came. He's very nice man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes. He suffered, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> In personal life also, he has suffered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One of his sons died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's what I was telling. He's a very good man. His wife is also coming from a very religious family, like what your grace said, you know. His wife's grandfather was one of the real <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> you see. He lived in a... He was a Jat, but he was also a yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our history, we find so many <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> householder, kings, <span class="Italic">rājarṣi.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Rājā,</span> king, at the same time, <span class="Italic">ṛṣi.</span> This was the king. Just like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. <span class="Italic">Rājarṣi.</span> He's a king, but <span class="Italic">ṛṣi.</span> You read that portion. Yes. The government of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, how they were happy, just see. <span class="Italic">Kāmam, kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ [SB </span>1.10.4]<span class="Italic">. Parjanya.

<div class="After-Verse">"During the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag, and cheerful attitude, the cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, happy attitude. Now the cow are going to be killed. They know it, that "We are going to be killed." They're also intelligent living entity. So how they can be happy? If some human being concentrated in a camp, and they know that "We are going to be killed," can they be happy? So if one is not happy, if the cow is not happy, can she supply sufficient milk? No. No. Therefore just they were happy. Therefore milk was supplied so much that the grazing ground became wet with milk. Muddy. With milk, not with water. So we, we have no intelligence how to live. We... Our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya vaiśya.</span> Means <span class="Italic">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya,</span> to protect cows. Nowadays not to protect cows-to kill cows. Just see, business. <span class="Italic">Vaiśya</span> means businessman. So <span class="Italic">vaiśya's</span> business is <span class="Italic">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> But no <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> Cutting the throat of <span class="Italic">go.</span> This kind of sinful activities are going on, and they want to be happy. Instead of giving protection to the cows... In the Bible, also it is said that the animals are given under the protection of the human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Man, yeah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man. The protection means to kill them. Just see. They have interpreted like that, that "The animals have been given to us to kill them and eat." This is their interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Swamiji, I have taken already... You have been so kind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No it is very kind of you that you have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> No, it's all on you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, we're preparing <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Purīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Purīs</span> and sweet rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are simply trying to revive people's dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So every sane man, every good government, everyone should come forward to help this movement. It is not a personal affair. We are not presenting that "I am <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> I am God." We are presenting science, philosophy. You see? Why we are taking so much trouble to write so many books? If we... We want to convince people through science, philosophy, logic, religious principle, by practical behavior. All these boys are being trained up not to have any illicit sex, not to eat meat, and not to take any intoxication up to tea, coffee, cigarette and not to indulge in gambling. They're doing that. So we are making men of character, men of religion, men of philosophy. Why people should not cooperate with us? We are not presenting any blind, so-called religious faith. No. That is not our business. Our business is <span class="Italic">śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-dayā karaha vicāra.</span> You understand little Bengali? You understand Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Verse">śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-dayā karaha vicāra<br class="calibre2"/>vicāra karile citte pābe camatkāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 8.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If you are sane man, if you give due consideration, and then give your judgement, then you'll find that it is wonderful. <span class="Italic">Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-dayā karaha vicāra.</span> We don't say that you take it blindly. No. <span class="Italic">Vicāra.</span> After full logic, and consideration, you accept, not blindly. But if you do that, you'll see it is wonderful. It is wonder... So why those who are advanced in education, they should not take this movement seriously and try to understand seriously and cooperate with us? It is not a blind thing. So... Actually, from government level, we are not getting any support. Not... I don't speak in India. Anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, I am aware of the government problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Because they think, "Oh, it is religious." Not only they are... In America there are big, big foundation. As soon as we submit some petition, "Help us," "No, no, we don't help any religious movement." That's all. We don't get any help. Simply Kṛṣṇa has given us this chance of selling these books. That's all. Nobody's cooperating. Rather, when our people go to sell these literatures and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, they're arrested and harassed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That is because of, I think, a lot of confusion with drug movement, hippies and all that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. But... It may be... You might have been cheated by counterfeit money in some place. Does it mean there is no good money? What is this reasoning? "Because I have been cheated by some man, he gave me some counterfeit money, therefore I'll not touch money any more. No. Any note, that's all. We don't like." What is this? He must judge whether it is counterfeit or real. That is required. So if you can help us in some way or other, try to help us. Otherwise we shall go on with this single-handed. But I am not getting any help from any other source. Then this movement had been, would have been very, very rapidly progressing. It is progressing, but... Because we don't get any support... Lord Buddha's movement was spread because King Aśoka supported.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Christ also? Constantine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Protestantism, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The Protestant movement also, when they broke away from the Catholic church, the kings would protect the movement and fight to protect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is king's duty.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> But as individuals we'd be very happy to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even if we approach higher authorities... Our men in New Delhi saw Indira Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. She said that "This is the position, that we are secular. We cannot support." Of course, we want simply Kṛṣṇa's support. And we are increasing. We are not decreasing. The movement was started in 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's tremendous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it is all over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All over the world. From this Sweden to Australia, New Zealand, North and South. And all round the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> What about Germany also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's in charge of this zone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> The Germans are very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, we have a temple in Berlin, and Munchen, and Hamburg and Heidelberg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not discouraged. We are not discouraged. But sometimes we are sorry that such a nice movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Is not supported. I mean, I... We have this dilemma. I'm being very honest with you. First, we have got the dilemma of choosing the right thing, you know, because so many people claim to speak about reviving Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, as, as you find out... Just like you issue license to medical practitioner. Registered medical... Why don't you see that which movement is genuine? That is the duty of the government. But the government is also, they're unaware about which one is actually... (Devotees bring in <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, I'm... I'm very grateful to you, but this is, it is a meal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> It is our pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can keep here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'll take the real <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> I'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can take. It is all real <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> But, you know this, to us is, we call in Kerala. This is called <span class="Italic">tryamṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> <span class="Italic">Tryamṛta</span> is sugar and honey and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pañcāmṛta,</span> we have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Hmm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tryamṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes. All this is prepared by these young men? (eating.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. One thing I can request you, that you give us, some of, some of our men, going to India, missionary visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that they can stay there. Because we have now four, five temples. And I require their assistance. To maintain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> In India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India. So if you kindly give some of our men the missionary visa, it will be very kind of you. It is missionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'll immediately write and find out because it is a very logical thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Because we give them to other religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not this? So if you kindly help in this way. That is within your power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'll simply write. Of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, there is no use of writing. You can do it. We can immediately submit some of the names. And you can give us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Of course, from Sweden, I mean, it depends upon the nationality. People can go for three months without any visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is different thing. But missionary visa. From missionary... When there's missionary, there is no question of any particular country, because we have got men from different countries. Our men, ISKCON representatives, they should be given missionary visa when they want to go. That is my... That much help I want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Who is the representative in India? Of this...? In Delhi, of your organization? In Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Delhi?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> He should meet someone fairly senior in the home ministry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I can write to him, and he can also meet. I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can, you can give some introductory...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, I will give the names, too. You come to the Embassy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, visa, of course, it is to be given from here. So why you should refer to Delhi? You can use your discrimination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I don't think so. I'll see. I doubt very much. If I can exercise, I am prepared to exercise it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... No, no. Visa, visa is issued from the country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yeah, from the embassy, but we have got some, some people we can straight-away issue. In some cases they would refer to India. But if we make a positive recommendation, they will agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that I do not know. But visa is given by the embassy, from the local place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you kindly eat all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I feel privileged(?), but I can't eat them all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is only two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'll eat only two <span class="Italic">parāṭās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, two <span class="Italic">parāṭās.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you can submit immediately some of the names. Because we are organizing there, and the security department there: "Oh, your visa is now complete. You please return."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who... We have got now temples. Who will manage that? Big, big temples I have constructed. In Navadvīpa, in Hyderabad.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, In Vṛndāvana. We have got very, very, big, big temples now. So those temples, the Indians are callous. They are after technology. They are not coming. So how I'll manage, how I'll manage them if they are driven away? That is my problem. But the Indian boys, they are not coming. Indian educated... They are coming, but not very educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> That's... I, I understand what you mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The educated Indian, boys, they'll accept good service. Why they come to temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I'm sorry. You are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is education. They are not prepared to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They want some good service and enjoy life. That's all.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> How shall I put it? Extremely material and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everywhere. Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> So I do not expect much response. I'm being very honest with you, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everywhere. In India also. Indians are everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they think... Familiarity breeds contempt. "Oh, Kṛṣṇa, we know. What you have got to teach us?"

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You are... Why you have not right? Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes, I've got, there are discretions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, then it will be useless. Because as soon as you send to Delhi, they'll refuse. So then don't try for it. If you can, if you can help personally, then we'll submit the names. Otherwise, if you go in official channels, I don't expect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> No, I'll look at the rules you see and... I can't break the rules.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you see the rules. If you can...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then when I shall send some of my men to know that you can? When I shall send?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> By tomorrow afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. That's all right. Then I shall... Otherwise, useless. If you officially forward, and they reply, it will be... No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know why. The Christian missionaries, they get missionary visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> But I would... If you permit me, I am still, if I find a rule, rights, I'll do it. Otherwise, I'll be very happy to write a very strong letter to the Deputy Secretary concerned and also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, in whatever way you can help. This is a difficulty for me, that there are chasing after our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I personally think that there is not much reason to... Because we are allowing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no reason at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> And this is the... Hypocritical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If, if they're giving missionary visa to the Christian missionaries, what we have done? So kindly be seriously thinking and, if possible, give us. So he'll go in the afternoon and see him. If he's able, then we can send some men. And many men, they're prepared to go to India. But this botheration. They'll go, after spending so much money, and they'll be chased. That has become a problem. Otherwise I have told some years ago that "Sometimes you'll have to import <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> from this place."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Looks like they are better <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> I agree with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Because there is a... The definition of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> of course, is made by Buddha's said: (Sanskrit )</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says,</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam<br class="calibre2"/>yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta<br class="calibre2"/>tat tenaiva vinirdiśet<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 7.11.35]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These are clear indications that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is not from particular family. And Kṛṣṇa says, another place,</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br class="calibre2"/>ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatiṁ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.32]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Everyone, Kṛṣṇa is open for everyone. Kṛṣṇa does not say that only... He says that <span class="Italic">kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyāḥ.</span> Everyone is accepted. Why not the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas?</span> But <span class="Italic">te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.</span> Those who are not even born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family... Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says, <span class="Italic">kibā vipra kiba śūdra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Kibā vipra kiba śūdra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kibā vipra kibā nyāsī śūdra kene naya, yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, tattva-vettā, sei guru haya.</span> He becomes spiritual master. It doesn't matter what he is. <span class="Italic">Śūdra,</span> or <span class="Italic">vipra,</span> it doesn't matter. The Rāmānanda Rāya, he was a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> According to social position, he was a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But Caitanya Mahāprabhu took lessons from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is in the Eighth Chapter of the Madhya Khaṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> So I'll remember it, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> And if I'm able to come for some meetings, I'll come. If I do not, that means only I am busy, you know. Because it's a little busy. But I think some of the members of our embassy will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> No, I mean to the functions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Functions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> We'll try to come whichever is we are able to come, you know, from the embassy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, of course, you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambassador:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So give him... [break] (end).</div>
