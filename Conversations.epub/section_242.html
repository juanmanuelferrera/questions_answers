<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It appears to be. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is just like Indian market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India also... Similarly, I've seen Philippines also like this. Japanese almost like this.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tokyo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In Malaysia also (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are all oriental countries. Five thousand years ago this whole planet was India, Bhārata-varṣa. That we get from history, <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> This planet name is Bhārata-varṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> After King Parīkṣit, then it divided up, that soon after?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Divided? They are also already divided. But the culture diminished. Because the center of culture was India, Delhi. So as the power diminished, the maintenance of the culture diminished, and by contact with other types of aboriginal, they learned eating meat and gradually degraded. And they discovered different kinds of religion because... Just like at the present moment Christians are protesting why there should not be abortion. So they wanted to degraded. So the Indian culture did not allow, so the separate type of religion came out. This is the (indistinct). They wanted, "Why there should not be meat-eating?" But Indian culture would not allow, so they become Mohammedans, they become Christians, like this. Even in India all the..., what are these Mohammedans? The Mohammedans, they are lower class men, less than <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But Hindus, higher class, they would not touch it. But when the Mohammedans, that we will be on equal right, they, there is a (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So there's no spiritual motive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Later on it became political, because as soon as the spiritual power, culture become diminished, the whole thing became material. So people wanted material advantage, so separated from Vedic culture. Just like Buddhists. Buddhism was a Hindu culture. But Lord Buddha wanted to stop animal sacrifice. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> animal sacrifice is recommended under certain conditions. He even denied that, "No that also cannot be done." So therefore they are separate from Vedic culture. After all these, all these religious systems-Mohammedanism, Jewism, then Christianism, Buddhism-they are at a stage not more than 2,000 years. And before 2,000 years, what was the culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The Christians here, get money from America. In Bali, where there's many Hindus live, they convert many people by saying, "If you become a Christian, you'll have good economy with us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is the Christian propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Same in Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, everywhere. They cannot attract people by their philosophy. It is show money, "Yes, come on, take money." (pause) Hong Kong also. [break] Very, many meat shops. Rather this vegetable,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It costs a lot of money. Meat is more expensive to eat. Actually, most people, mostly they eat vegetables because it is available. But there's much fish. There's much fish and they carry around in the streets everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In the Eastern countries usually people eat little bits of meat but they're vegetable. It's only in the West that they eat steak. But in every restaurant, they all have meat, much chicken also. They raise chickens. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Tomorrow morning we have asked some Indian community leaders to come about 7 o'clock, because they want to be requested by you to do something to help make a temple or what you like. But they... Apparently they feel unhappy because we have not met with the leaders and asked them to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should I put the question? They should first of all. They should come forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, actually that meeting with the Indians they wanted you to eat some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in the room, and come inside, and request, and ask you like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That was before that night they want... I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, he doesn't understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The night that, the first gathering at the Indian man's home, they all wanted to meet with you then but Amogha didn't know that. They were planning to come in the room and offer their services. But there was some mix-up, and they didn't understand. They thought they had been cut off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They told me they wanted you to go in the room for <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> But they wanted a meeting and they didn't tell me. I didn't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can request them. But if they deny that will be insult for me. Therefore I do not like to request them. That will be not good for them, if I request and then they deny, or they do not do. That is not that will be good for them. It is better not to request. That will be offense, if they deny. Or if they did not carry out my order, then it will be offense. Why should they put themselves in such risk? Generally it is the duty of the householder to offer, "Sir, what can I do for you?" Then I can request. But if, as a beggar, I request them and they deny, then that will be great offense for them. That will not good for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We are almost there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you wanted to secure place here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. They have a house in this area, but it is a bit far from the center of town.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. It is good quarter, you can take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> O.K. It is about one mile more though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> O.K.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also a center. It is congested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. It is near a bus station also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (end)</div>
