<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...increase your attachment. And that is also stated in the Fourth..., <span class="Italic">vīta-rāga-bhaya... man-mayā mad-āśrayaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the process. If you want to know God-Kṛṣṇa means God-then this is the process. What is that? <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta-manāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta-manāḥ partha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is yoga practice also. Yoga. Yoga means to concentrate the mind on a subject matter. So we should meditate upon Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta.</span> Then gradually you'll increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa. And that is the perfection of life. The perfection of life, the symbol is in Vṛndāvana. Because all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they were very, very, much attached to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Attached to Kṛṣṇa were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The cowherd boys, the girls, the elderly persons, the trees, the flowers, the land, the birds, the beasts, the cows-their center was Kṛṣṇa. So we have to follow their footprints, how to... We have got already attachment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, attachment we have got for material things. That we have to transfer. This is yoga practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> That is yoga practice. Correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ. Yoga,</span> the... I think it is <span class="Italic">Patañjali sūtra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Yoga citta bhūti yoga.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Citta bhūti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Yoga citta bhūti nirodha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirodha.</span> So our activities are now materially centered-how to satisfy the senses. All these so-called improvements, material improvements, means how to satisfy the senses. So this <span class="Italic">aśaktiḥ,</span> attachment, for material sense gratification...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Has to be transferred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To Kṛṣṇa. Yes. <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta-manaḥ partha.</span> This is yoga. This is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> It is said, <span class="Italic">jñānaṁ te sa-vijñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it can be done <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ. Āśrayaḥ,</span> to take shelter. "Taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa," you can make this meaning or <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ</span> means "one who has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Kṛṣṇa. Correct. Correct. That is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Mad-āśrayaḥ</span> means <span class="Italic">āśrayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Either you... Directly it is not possible to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ</span> means "one who has taken shelter of Me." That is <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. You take shelter of Him. Then the result will be <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Hello.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Asaṁśayaḥ</span> means at the present moment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Without any doubts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... People are in doubt whether there is God, or "If there is God, He might have died by this time." So there are so many... (laughs) Yes. When I first went to U.S.A., the theory was "God is dead." But when I began to speak, they realized, "No, God is not dead. God is with Swamiji." They wrote. They wrote articles. So <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaṁ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Samagraṁ māṁ.</span> From all aspects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From all aspects. <span class="Italic">Yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu.</span> So Kṛṣṇa is speaking about Himself. We can speculate about God. That way we'll never be successful. Because we have got limited senses. Therefore you hear from Kṛṣṇa about Kṛṣṇa. This is called <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> And He wants to tell the <span class="Italic">jñānaṁ te 'haṁ sa-vijñānam</span> [Bg. 7.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> "What I have realized, I tell you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not realized!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam,</span> how it can be practically applied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Yes, how it can be practically applied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not that he has realized. He's God. He's already realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Matter of knowing, application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Practical application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like practical science. If you want to pass B.A. examination, you have to appear for theoretical and practical, both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Theory and practice both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> means to know God, at the same time, practically employ yourself in the service of God, or in the transaction between God and yourself. That is <span class="Italic">vijñānam. Sa-vijñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is the distinction between <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> and <span class="Italic">vijñāna?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāna</span> means theoretical knowledge, and <span class="Italic">vijñāna</span> means practical knowledge. Simply to know "God is great," that is not sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that is theoretical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is theoretical. You must know how great He is. That we have to learn from the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> from the guru, how great He is. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> Vedic, <span class="Italic">yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.</span> He's the source of all material elements. In Him everything stays, and after annihilation, everything goes into Him. This is one understanding. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way, from <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> from guru, from saintly persons, we have to understand. <span class="Italic">Sādhu guru śāstra vākya. Sādhu</span> means who speaks strictly on the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Guru also speaks strictly on <span class="Italic">śāstra. Śāstra</span> is the medium. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na siddhim avāpno...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]. Therefore we protest. Unless there is something mentioned in the authorized <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> we don't accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Is it <span class="Italic">nityaḥ anityānām</span> or <span class="Italic">nityaḥ nityānām?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānām.</span> Plural number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Plural, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plural number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Permanent. Permanent, impermanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of them permanent. No, no, no. Permanent... The <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> and the Supreme Lord, both of them are permanent, <span class="Italic">nityā. Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam.</span> It is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam.</span> Eternal, always existing. And this material word has been described: <span class="Italic">asasvataḥ. Duḥkhālayam aśāśvataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Aśāśvatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aśāś...</span> It is not permanent. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> It appears and disappears. So because <span class="Italic">nityo nityānām,</span> there is transaction between the <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> the Supreme <span class="Italic">Nitya,</span> Kṛṣṇa, and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Cetanaś cetanānām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the subordinate <span class="Italic">nityas,</span> the living entities. So there must be one place also where this transaction takes place. Because this is <span class="Italic">anitya.</span> This material world is <span class="Italic">anitya.</span> So how the transaction between the <span class="Italic">nitya</span> and <span class="Italic">nityānām</span> can take place? Because the place is <span class="Italic">anitya.</span> Therefore there must be a place which is <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> There must be place. That is <span class="Italic">Vaikuṇṭha dhāma,</span> spiritual world. So by practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> scientifically, by practical understanding, practical application, <span class="Italic">yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ,</span> either at the shelter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Anyaj jñātam neha bhūyo...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Anyaj jñātam avaśiṣyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Then <span class="Italic">anyaj jñātavyam.</span> No. Then you become perfect. No more knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> No more knowledge is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, knowledge is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Final</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Final, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam etaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavanti.</span> This is also <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad. Yasmin vijñāte.</span> If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">sarvam eva vijñātaṁ bhavanti.</span> Then you have got full knowledge. And that is also stated in the Fourth Chapter. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyam yo janāti tattvataḥ, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti... [Bg. </span>4.9]. He becomes immediately liberated. Simply if you understand Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ,</span> in truth, then you are, your business is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ [Bg. 7.3].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, to understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy job. First of all, so many millions and millions of living entities are there. They are not interested. They are just like animals: "Eat, drink, be merry and enjoy." Nobody's interested what is the success of life, <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> They do not know. They think, "If I..." Now, especially in this age, if you can eat sumptuously then it is <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> all <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Udāraṁ bharita, svārtham udāraṁ bharita.</span> That just we see people are so lazy. If they can eat their daily food some way or other, begging, borrowing and stealing, just like animals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have got <span class="Italic">ūdara-śiṣṇu-parāyanaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Parāyanaḥ.</span> So they think, "Now my day's business is finished. Now I have eaten." And <span class="Italic">dakṣyaṁ kuṭumba-bharaṇam.</span> And if one man can maintain a family of four, five, men, "Oh, he's Mahārāja Dakṣa." Mahārāja Dakṣa, you know? He was a great personality. He was performing <span class="Italic">yajñas.</span> So this is Kali-yuga. Even they will not be able to maintain a wife, a few children. There is no shelter. I have seen in, all these things in western countries. They have no fixed up. Just like animals. The animal also loitering in the street or in the jungle; they are loitering in a great jungle, a great city. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ [Bg. 7.3].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore the Māyāvādīs cannot understand. Although they have come to the point of <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> still they cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> They are <span class="Italic">siddhas</span> because they have understood that "I am not this body, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span>" This much they have understood. But still they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> Although they are trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ.</span> They do not know. They say,"Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span>" God is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> "I am as good as God." These theories, encumbrous theories... because they do not know. <span class="Italic">Yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kaścin māṁ vetti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when one has come to this knowledge perfectly, that "I am not this body, I am spirit soul, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span>" that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta</span> stage. So, so after <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]</span> stage, there are so many other things. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These <span class="Italic">bhūteṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he comes to the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Not that only <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā,</span> not <span class="Italic">dhani-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You came out with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no that is, that is the deficiency. If <span class="Italic">daridra</span> is Nārāyaṇa, why not the <span class="Italic">dhani?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Again, we are not (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we have to accept. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> A devotee is equal. Either he's <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">dhani-nārāyaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhani-nārāyaṇa,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Both are equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both are equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Either poor or rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Devotee's equal, whether poor or rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> Why there should be distinction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ<br class="calibre2"/>khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me<br class="calibre2"/>bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span>Bg. 7.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Astadhā,</span> that's the lower <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so now the study, first study, begins from material point of view: Wherefrom the sky came? How the sky came into existence? First of all sky. Then, from sky, there is sound. Then, from sound there is air. From air, there is... Along with these creations... the sky creation means the air creation also, the reception of the sound. So in this way it is all described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> very nicely, how creation took place. Then, ultimately, we come to the land, where all the qualities of other elements are there. There is sound. There is touch. There is vision. There is smell. Everything is there. So... And the subtle matters. Mind, <span class="Italic">citta,</span> intelligence, then <span class="Italic">buddh...</span> intelligence. Then false ego. This is... At the present moment, everyone is thinking in the bodily concept of life: "I am American." "I am Indian." "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" "I am <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span>" This is false ego. He's not, neither of them. Because he's spirit soul, a different identity. So these, how the subtle mind, intelligence, are working, one should know. How transmigration of the soul takes place? By the action of mind, intelligence and ego. They do not know. There is no such science. There are so many universities all over the world. But who is studying all these things? The psychologists, they have studied a little more about thinking, feeling and willing. That's all. But they do not know how he is working, how he is carrying the subtle soul to other body. That they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> <span class="Italic">Apareyam itas tu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Why do you not explain that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Why do you not explain that about subtle being carried forward?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is going to come now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Subtle body... Just like your body at night is on the bed, but you are carried by the thinking, feeling, intelligence to somewhere else. Is it not? So how are you are carried? You are actually lying on the bed. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is carried by the subtle body. Similarly, death means that this body stops working. But the subtle mind... Exactly in the same way. Just as while you are sleeping this gross body has stopped to work, but the subtle body is working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is in, I mean, <span class="Italic">svapna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Svapna,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that does not work in deep sleep.</div>
