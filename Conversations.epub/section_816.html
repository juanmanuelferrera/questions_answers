<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Yei bhaje sei boro.</i> Here is woman (indistinct) engaged in worshiping (indistinct), she is great. <i class="calibre3">Yei bhaje sei boro.</i> So why should we hurt woman? Anyone who is engaged in service, he is big. The dress is not important. The advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is important. We have to see from that formula. Just like we sometimes have to dress like ordinary gentleman and sell books. Does it mean he is deviating? No. He's serving Kṛṣṇa, dress or no dress. It doesn't matter. If you stick to the dress, "Oh, I have taken <i class="calibre3">sannyāsī,</i> I cannot..." He cannot sell the books. Where is your service influence? You must give service first. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Is that Līlāvatī? No. It is Līlāvatī? No. I was thinking that she is Līlāvatī dressed like a widow, because she never likes to be widow. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> That's Hridayānanda's old wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> That's Hridayānanda's old wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, Dayānanda's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> Hridayānanda Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> She is widow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Nobody is widow, because Kṛṣṇa is ultimate husband. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Jaya Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Jaya!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Children:</b> Jaya Śrīla Prabhupāda! Jaya Prabhupāda! Jaya Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Jaya!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Children:</b> Jaya Śrīla Prabhupāda! Hari bol!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hari bol! So where is the artist for painting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Photograph?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Make the bullock cart an international. They'll be surprised. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya</i>. We must be always convinced that if we simply take up the knowledge given by Kṛṣṇa, then you are perfect. That's all. If little success is there for me than other swamis and yogis, it is due to my conviction on this point. I never compromised with anything which is not spoken by Kṛṣṇa. Did you mark it or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> One time you told us, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to meet every man at his door and ask him to give up everything he knows and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is simple. "You rascal, you give up whatever you have learned, you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." Don't say "rascal," but indirectly (laughter), that "Whatever you have learned, it is all nonsense." <i class="calibre3">Sakalam eva vihāya dūrāt</i>, "You give up everything, kicked out, and simply become adherent to Caitanya." This is our preaching. And what Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <i class="calibre3">yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<i class="calibre3">,</i> that's all. Because ultimately He is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> Can you repeat why you said you have been successful where others have not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Because I stick to Kṛṣṇa's word. I, therefore, present <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā </i>as it is. We do not make any amendment nor accept any amendment. And, therefore, we decry everything-Gandhi, Dr. Radhakrishnan, Aurobindo, this, that-all rascals. Because they tried to amend it. That is admitted by the science professor. They have all tried to make it modernized, but I have not done. Here is the spiritual master in the disciplic succession, so we remain indebted to him to understand the original traditional knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Also that professor from Mexico City, he appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, everyone who is after truth will accept. If he's a bogus, if you want to be cheated and cheat others, that will not. Ninety-nine percent, they are cheaters and cheated. This is the position. All these cheaters they are cheating, and they accept to be cheated. If I am very clever that I don't want to be cheated, then nobody can cheat me. But these rascals, they want to be cheated. If you say, "No, no, what is the wrong in illicit sex?" That means you want to be cheated. And if you say, "(indistinct) this swami is very conservative." This is the position. We want cheap things because we want to be cheated. And there are so many cheaters, they will take advantage and cheat you. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> Allen Ginsberg, he said that, that you were very conservative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, because he wants to be cheated. And he cheats others. Some followers, he is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> <i class="calibre3">Yato mat tato pat.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Yato mat tato pat</i>. Yes, this is going on. This business, cheaters and cheated. We preach to one, the innocent persons who are being cheated, and we don't want to cheat anybody, but what Kṛṣṇa says. Our business is very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> So we should expose these bogus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, we are exposing, that is our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Actually, by making such wonders they are exposing themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Just like Guru Maharaj-ji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyone, why Guru Maharaj-ji, any Mahārāja. Any man who will speak something which is not in the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa, he is cheating. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> But if we take that we are the only way, then people call us fanatics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They may say. They are themselves fanatics. Who cares for them? If a madman says you are madman, I have to accept? No. He must be a sane man. Then there is some meaning. He is calling me madman, but he is a... If I am blind and if another man, he is blind, he says you are blind, so what is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> So is the principle to first prove that they are insane and then afterwards that we're sane, or first to prove that we're sane and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Our proof is that we are following the sane man's instruction, or sane being, the Supreme Being. There cannot be any mistake. Therefore, we are sane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They say they are also following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Therefore, why they are changing? We don't change, millions of years. What Kṛṣṇa said, we are following the same. But they change every year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> That Vairagi Bhava, he showed up in Hong Kong, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> You know that person who gives us the <i class="calibre3">mandir</i> in Vrndavana and... What's his name? We stay at that Fogal Ashram every year? Vairagi Bhava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Vairagi Bhava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> He showed up in Hong Kong. He said that "There are two great influences in my life: one Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who taught me service..., who taught me devotion," and he said, "Ramakrishna, who taught us service to man." He also showed up with one woman <i class="calibre3">sannyāsīni</i> or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Service to man. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Especially woman. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> And wearing saffron too. You gave him an offer he could travel and become..., and take part in our movement if he was willing to preach <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pañcadraviḍa:</b> He did not accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means he wants to cheat. (loud kīrtana-end)</div>
