<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I remember those days immediately when I see the sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You were getting seasick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I liked it. Although I was sick, still, I liked it. Day and night, for thirty-five days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I came to America in the same way, but I was always sick. I didn't like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sea journey is very good provided there is no sea-sickness. Otherwise very bad. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma... [break] ...all of our books in different languages. At least all the European languages. America is one language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> South America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> South America, different languages. Spanish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Spanish, Portuguese.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Rāma Hare... What about that Japanese translation? Something is done or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Just a magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. His wife was translating Japanese?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It has to be checked over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> There is a girl in Tokyo who is very expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> She's doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> She's been doing the magazine. She can do more. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yesterday Nitāi found a quote from the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> that says, "There are many gurus who will take away your money, but rare is the one who will take away your miseries."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Guravo bahavaḥ santi vittāpahārakaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">guravo bahavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>santi vittāpahārakaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>taṁ tu guruṁ na paśyāmi<br class="calibre2"/>śiṣya-santā-pahārakāḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"There are many gurus. They are very expert in plundering disciples' money, but it is very difficult to find out a guru who can take out all the anxieties of the disciple." <span class="Italic">Śiṣya santa-pahārakāḥ.</span> Guru is meant for taking away the <span class="Italic">santāpa. Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kārunya-ghanāghanatvam **.</span> "The <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> will be peaceful"-objective of life-that is the business of guru, not to take away his money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In one lecture you were explaining those prayers, <span class="Italic">saṁsāra,</span> and you said the first business of the guru is to take away the anxiety of the disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, our people, they have got some hope that they're going back to home, back to Godhead. And all other rascals-zero. Who is endeavoring for zero? What is this endeavor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There's nothing to do for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> also<span class="Italic">-gurur na sa syāt.</span> He should not be guru unless he is able to protect his disciple from the imminent danger of death. <span class="Italic">Na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.</span> This cycle of birth and death is going on. Guru's business is how to stop this cycle of birth and death. And it is not very difficult. Teach him to understand Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is assuring, "If anyone understands Me nicely, then after giving up this body he comes to Me." Where is the difficulty? Give him Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he is saved from birth and death. There is nothing wonderful. There is no jugglery. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...only institution for mitigating the sufferings of humanity. But they don't know what is the real suffering of humanity. <span class="Italic">Dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.</span> That is the real suffering, cycle of birth and death. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> These rascals, they do not know what is the goal of life, <span class="Italic">svārtha,</span> self-interest. Unless he comes to Viṣṇu, there is no question of <span class="Italic">svārtha-gati.</span> [break] ...reclaim this portion, eh... [break] ...strong and stout. Not all. [break] Yesterday it was a very nice city, and today it is finished. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> [break] And there is no God. Just see how intelligent they are. To pour water whole night thousands of miles, can the scientists arrange? So who is arranging for that? His father? His father, of course, arranges, but he does not agree to offer respect to the father. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpananda:</span> Another boy in a different place, householder, his business is making surfboards for a living. He builds the surfboards, and he puts big pictures of Kṛṣṇa, Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, on the surfboard so that when the boys are sitting on the board, like you saw that boy sitting on the surfboard, all day long they are looking at the picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tulasī</span> grows profusely in Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a good sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpānanda:</span> Yes. Many people, hundreds of people, are worshiping <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span> Even people we don't know, they, somehow or other, they have gotten <span class="Italic">tulasī,</span> and they are worshiping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. They will become devotee. Without any fail, they will become devotees. If they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and worship <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> leaf, they'll be liberated without any fail, and they will become devotee. [break] ...gradually appreciate. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But the little boy, the three year old boy, he appreciates very much. He loves your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> I was distributing a book to someone, and when he saw your picture he said, "Ah, yes, in 1966 I chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> And he took a book because he saw your picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. 1966, I was chanting in San Francisco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He said he chanted with you and your disciples on Second Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He said he was fifteen then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that, Thompkinson? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Thompkins Square Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Many, many people came to that storefront.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes, it was packed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Packed every night, seventy-five, eighty people. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I went to that New York storefront first of all, and I was a Māyāvā... Well, I was a rascal. So they called me a rascal, so I became very offended. (laughs) Later on, I saw that they were right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you called them rascal? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No. I knew that they were not rascals. They looked very pure. I just left. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sunshine has covered 93,000,000 miles all round, so the sunshine is big or the sun is big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> The potency is in the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is big, not the Brahmān. And within the sun globe there is sun-god, Vivasvān. They do not know all these. They think the sunshine is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> The sun is different than Vivasvān?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not different. Just like the sunshine is not different from the sun globe. Sun globe means all the inhabitants there, they are glowing. Therefore the whole planet is glowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Vivasvān, he is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is also glowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> He will stay as long as the sun... He is present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he has got a duration of life. When the creation will be annihilated he'll be annihilated. He'll be not annihilated. Nobody is annihilated, but he's not manifest, nonmanifest. He is demigod. The demigods, with the annihilation of the material world, they will be all finished. But Kṛṣṇa will remain there. <span class="Italic">Aham eva āsam agre.</span> And He will be remained. He was in the beginning of creation, and at the end of creation He'll be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> it is mentioned, <span class="Italic">sarva-devāmayo guruḥ</span> [SB 11.17.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Guru is the representation of all Gods and demigods."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda, in Vṛndāvana you were explaining about the sun, that the sun is not fire, but the living entities there have glowing bodies. So how do they glow? You said it was not the glow of the soul, but it was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you not glow? How? God has made you not glowing, and He has made them glowing. That's all. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I mean to say is there a difference between...? Just like we have fire here, is it different from the glowing there? You said the sun is not fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. No, no, without fire how there can be glow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So they have fiery bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But when we see fire here it is also living in that way? Some living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within fire? Yes. That is <span class="Italic">agni-po.</span> Just like you have got microbes and germs in water, similarly, there are microbes and germs in fire also. <span class="Italic">Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam.</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, adāhyaḥ.</span> "It is not burned by fire." Everything, information, is there. And therefore our knowledge is perfect. Take from the perfect source of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam aśleṣya, aśoṣya.</span> (end)</div>
