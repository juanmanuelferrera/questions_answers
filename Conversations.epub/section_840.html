<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What kind of <span class="Italic">mūḍha?</span> Eh? So many of our devotees, they do not work. How they are living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That's Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they do not see to it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> 'Cause they're <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> They don't believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Even they see it, still, they do not believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They're envious, that we can do it and they can't. If you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then it could be done. If you want to struggle yourself, then you have to struggle. That one lady was.... They were criticizing how we have such big building and everything, and then you invited her to come and stay with us and she wouldn't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall go again or go back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can go again if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is time. They are very much attached to their sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The stool, you take them and keep it apart. They will go again to the stool. Nature's way, they must suffer. So-called philanthropic activities, welfare activities-useless. You cannot do any welfare activity; you must suffer. Only way you can do them some good, inducing them chanting, that's all. Otherwise no possibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> In <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> class this morning, that was the verse. The greatest welfare activity is if they hear and chant about Kṛṣṇa's wonderful activities. That is the greatest welfare activity. So yesterday, when that man came from the government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes, the social minister came. He did not.... You simply told him to come and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and he didn't, couldn't believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are practically seeing and still not believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He doesn't have such a nice house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He accepts the result, but he won't take the process. He sees that they've given up everything he is trying to defeat, which is sinful activity, illicit sex, intoxication, but he won't take the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> One reporter told you that she was happy, and you said, "Well, if it is happiness, then it's simply happiness of the dog." So they have become satisfied with that standard of happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they create this botanical garden? If they are satisfied with the happiness of a dog, then why they spend so much money for this botanical garden? Hm? Let them be satisfied like dog, lie down on the street. Why this sense of botanical garden? [break] ...tendency for improving, artificially they are curbing down. Revolution there is. Artificially they say, "No. This is satisfied." Why they are making big, big skyscraper building? Let them remain like dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> [break] ...same for all their purposes, but because they have superior intelligence, they could make a nice facility to enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Superior? That means you have got, you, a separate utility for superior consciousness. So we have to search out what is the end of the superior consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I think that's mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta kovidaḥ.</span> That is intelligence. [break] ...intelligence. Why should you stop in one point? Make further progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> [break] ...the <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> to try to seek out, is better than to be a <span class="Italic">karmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> The <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they are trying to study <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> to find out what is the end. So that is better than being <span class="Italic">karmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Even if they don't know the answer, they are trying to seek out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, their answer is there, merging with the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But again they must come back. That's not complete liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means not complete knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So they have also stopped, ended in Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Practically, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we see that we're dealing mostly with <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> not with <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> in our preaching work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And they are simply interested in some immediate satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> not. <span class="Italic">Vikarmī. Karmī, vikarmī, akarmī.</span> We are dealing with <span class="Italic">vikarmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Vikarma,</span> oh. Prohibited actions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> will not do anything sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vikarma,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So why do we call them <span class="Italic">karmīs</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vikarmīs,</span> opposite <span class="Italic">karmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So there's practically no <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sinful activities, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ. Vikarma.</span> Therefore they will be punished in different forms of life. Therefore we find so many species of life, forms of life. This is punishment. But <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> curtain, they are thinking, "We are happy." Just like this tree is a punishment, but it has no sense that this is punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Thinks he's happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Standing happily for five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Drinking only water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are asked to stand here for five hours, you'll feel most uncomfortable. But they are standing for five thousand years, no uncomfortable. This is punishment. Punishment is there, but unaware. So everyone is like that. Anyone in the material world, they are being punished in different degree, but unaware. That is <span class="Italic">māyā</span>'s grace, that although he is punished, he cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So they answer that "If you're happy, then what's wrong with that?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that class you are here. You go on with that happiness. But we are not satisfied with this. You are rascal, you are happy in that way, but we are not. That is the difference between you and me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Happiness of the fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Sometimes they say that pain is part of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let them say, because they will have to suffer. Unless they think like that, how they will suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> What about on the hellish planets? Do they know they're suffering there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like to an animal, whipping is nothing. And for a man, to show the whip is sufficient. So there are different degrees of consciousness. Even a child, he'll be afraid by seeing the whip, and the animal, actually being whipped, doesn't care. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So either they take the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> or the <span class="Italic">śastra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of <span class="Italic">śāstra</span>; it is <span class="Italic">śastra</span> only. When there is no <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> there must be <span class="Italic">śastra. Argumentum baculum.</span> When there is no logic, give him whip, that's all. So all these, they are awaiting whipping. They are being whipped. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> How can we make them understand they're being punished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can understand, provided you have got the sense. If you are nonsense, you cannot understand. You cannot understand means you are nonsense. That is the difference between sense and nonsense. That I have already given, the example: the same whip, to the animal it is not suffering, but for a man, simply by seeing it is suffering. It is the question of sense. That is the difference between man and animal. The animal cannot understand that he is suffering. Man can understand. That is difference. If you do not understand, then you are animal. Now, here it is clearly said, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> This is unhappiness. And if you think, "Oh, what is there, unhappiness in dying?" then you are animal. The animal are taken to the slaughterhouse. He is not disturbed. He is eating grass very peacefully. That is the animal life. If you do not understand what is unhappiness, then you are animal. You are not human being. But his unhappiness, that's a fact, to remain in a airtight bag for ten months. If you have no sense, "Oh, what is this?" And still being killed, is it not unhappiness? And if you say, "Where is unhappiness?" then you are a stone. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi. Janma</span> is unhappiness. First of all you have to remain ten months in a packed-up bag and that also risk your mother will kill you, and still you say, "It is not unhappiness"? Then what is happiness? You are so dull that you see there is no unhappiness in birth. Practically see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But they're so nonsense, they say, "Well, I can't remember..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But therefore I say animal. Nonsense means animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> (yells incoherently)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think we're funny; we think they are funny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...difference between animal and man. Therefore if one is not spiritually advanced or has no spiritual sense, he's animal. He is not human being. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> The verdict is already there. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ.</span> He is nothing, no better than the cows and asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Often the devotee thinks that he's more unhappy than the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> because he knows he's unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that means he is not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> He's not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's not devotee. Devotee means the first sign will be happy, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> If he's not <span class="Italic">prasannātmā,</span> he's a rascal. He has not entered even devotional life. He's outside. That is the test. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. When he saw Viṣṇu, he said, "Everything is all right. I don't want anything." <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi.</span> That is Vaiṣṇava. And if he is still in want or unhappiness, that means he has no spiritual life at all. He is simply making a show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Our unhappiness is our lamentation for our past sinful activity, and because we're not committing any more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another. That is another. That is to remember the terrible condition of <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> (break-in car) ...devotee who thinks unhappy because he is thinking, "I am not getting tea. I am not getting cigarette. There is restriction of illicit life, no meat-eating..." In this way he is unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He cannot gratify his desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Real devotee will think, "Oh, so many botheration I have now given up." <span class="Italic">Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">. Bhakti-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">upaśamam:</span> "No more this, all this nonsense." That is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, anartha-upaśamam,</span> completely given up. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje, lokasya ajānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām.</span> But they do not know anything. They are increasing <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> They are to give up cigarette. No, they are manufacturing new brand of cigarette and advertising, "Please come. This cigarette is better than the other." This is going on. This is <span class="Italic">karmī</span> life. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has no sense that "I have smoke this cigarette and why, after another cigarette, the same thing?" But no. "I have enjoyed sex here. Why another sex?" He has no sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Available in every species of life also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">ajñāna. Ajñāna-timirāndhasya.</span> This big house, [break] ...so that you will work hard. And he used to do that. You bring money and he'll spend. And if you say, "Sir, we collected this money for this purpose." "Yes, he spent. You again collect." Somebody has paid that constructing temple, and he has spent for other purpose. Then, when the devotee will say, "Oh, what this man will say?" "That's all right. You collect again." [break] ...he'll get some money, he'll make some arrangement for doll exhibition and spend the all money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Are they going to start on Māyāpura building this year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is beginning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Collect and spend. Collect and spend for Kṛṣṇa, that is nice. I am therefore asking them to print books. I have got so much in the Book Fund. Print books. Let there be books stocked and no money stocked. [break] ...<span class="Italic">upaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Prabhupāda, we just got here.... Now we've just gotten one farm, two hundred acres. We're purchasing this next week. For eleven thousand dollars, two hundred acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> And it is up north. It is just like India, very hot, and you can grow everything. Hot all year round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So grow fruits, flowers, grains. Keep some men. It is very nice. [break] ...stones(?), they can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes. They're aren't very attracted to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> A little over fifty dollars an acre? Very reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very cheap. Very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Less than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That New Orleans, our farm? It was nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Māyāpura is the best farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And it will be still better when our plan is made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> We want to set the example this year by also giving a big donation to Māyāpura and also building here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the same time you see that it is not misspent. That is another defect, that our spending is not very frugal and spend like anything. There must be.... But in India they want to cheat you, and you are very expert, being cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is our <span class="Italic">karma.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">karma.</span> You are working sincerely, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> We are expert cheaters also. That's how we get the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are big cheaters. You don't cheat two rupees, three rupees. Two millions. (laughs) That is accusation, Alexander and the thief. The thief accused Alexander the Great that "What is the difference between you and me? I am a small thief; you are a big thief. That's all. Why you are punishing me? You are a big thief. You are doing same thing." Then he was let loose. "Yes, what is difference? (laughs) I am a big thief." [break] ...means Alexander the Great, actually he was great. Otherwise he is the emperor, and ordinary thief is accusing him and he said, "Yes, I am thief." He admitted. That is greatness. That is greatness. If he was not great, then he would have hanged him or punished him: "Oh, you are so.... You are accusing me?" But no, he accepted. That is greatness. Mistake is one fault, but to accept that "I have done mistake," that is greatness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned that on the beach in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That when a man admits that he is a <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> he is no more a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because he has understood that "What I am doing? I am <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Lord Caitanya says, <span class="Italic">ayi nanda-tanuja kiṅkaraṁ patitaṁ māṁ viṣame bhavāmbudhau</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Antya</i> 20.32, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 5]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fell down. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> One has to admit that he is fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the land you wanted to purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, it is still unsold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No one can do anything with it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This neighborhood here, they will not allow any more than three stories to be built, no high rise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. There cannot be any skyscraper building, so no capitalist will purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And no developer will use it just to make three-story flats because the land is too expensive. (end)</div>
