<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He doesn't want any improvement. He wants to keep it as a... Just like professional church, temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're more attached to the external form that they already have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is which we call churchianity. Christianity, churchianity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Churchianity. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Also he may lose his position because he has no knowledge (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda;:</span> That is going on everywhere. These, our Indian people, they're not interested in God. They're interested in (Hindi), some blessing, because they can make improvement in their material position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore these rascals come, they give them (Hindi or sounds like "ashes bath", maybe referring to Sai Baba), I give them, "I am so powerful, I give you (Hindi)," and they give them money, "Oh, here is a <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>" They'll get (Hindi) very cheaply, and make money. Instead of two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> I'll make ten <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> by the (Hindi). And he's Sai Baba, like rogues, they come to show them some magic, that "I have got some power, I can do anything I like, and if you become my devotee, you will improve." All these yogis, everything, they do like that. Mahesh Yogi also: "Take my <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Within six months you become perfect man and whatever you like, you can do."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Ha ha. No restrictions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is business only. Why there should be restrictions? Everyone does so, beginning from Vivekananda, Aurobindo, everyone. Aurobindo also used to say that you haven't got to do anything, you simply think of me, just like Kṛṣṇa says: "Simply think of Me." (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> One man came here, a <span class="Italic">haṭha-yogī,</span> so-called <span class="Italic">haṭha-yogī,</span> and he was putting water in his nose and cloth in his stomach and all twisting this way, going under water, and they were all very amazed and many people came to see. Just like the circus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And then they say "I will make you perfect man, whatever you like you can... You become my disciple, give me some money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> And enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a proverb, that a drowning man catches even a straw. A man is drowning, he's seeing the straw is floating, he wants to catch it. So in western countries, they are so much fed up with this materialistic way of life that any person from India comes, they think he may give something spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Light. Catch it. But what... Why did you not have <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> both of you. You have no time for <span class="Italic">tilaka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Our <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> was locked in the bathroom. The door got locked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tilaka,</span> why it is locked in bathroom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Somehow the door became locked from inside this morning, I don't know how but we couldn't go inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't get him my <span class="Italic">tilaka?</span> All right. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> This is called Jakarta Fair, International Fair for business trade. Once a year they come from all over the world and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This side is better than the other side. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They are sleeping on the street. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> ...things like this. They want to be glorious, to get what they call national spirit, nationalism, everybody is eager to improve the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why do they not back this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is a first-class nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes, but they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) them. Take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy. Your nationality will be first-class. [break] ...your nation, America. If they take it, everyone will take it. [break] Gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Probably gambling, lottery. [break] That Japanese man who you asked to come today, he reads Mandarin, Chinese. I gave him our Mandarin, Chinese <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> to read yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mandarin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you are Mandarin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Chinese, from Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This sky(?), they are making like Calcutta Esplanade. (indistinct) Victoria Memorial, you don't remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I've only been three days (indistinct) Śrīla Prabhupāda, before we left India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You were mostly in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes. "Mata" means "eye" and they use "hari" to mean "day". "hari" means "day" here and eye is mata, so they say it's the eye of day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is Sanskrit words like that. <span class="Italic">Divākara, divākara,</span> sun's name, <span class="Italic">divākara. Divā</span> means day and <span class="Italic">kara</span> means manufacturer. <span class="Italic">Divākara,</span> manufacturer of day, another name of sun. Cross here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes. (indistinct) That's all right. We'll watch. No problem. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is our car. [break] (in car:) (indistinct) should be noted, not (indistinct) (end)</div>
