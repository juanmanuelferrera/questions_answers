<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Just now from the Hanumān Mandir, just down the road there, not far, but I'm, we're all from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Here you are remaining there?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Nim Karoli?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Nim Karoli. And he asked us to come here to this place and ask... He requested a <i class="calibre3">kīrtana</i> at the temple. He would like some of the people here to come and sing a <i class="calibre3">kīrtana</i>, if you, if you, if you wish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Kīrtana</i> we hold here. If we have to go individually everyone's house, how it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> I, I don't know. I'm just... He asked me to come and request it, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We are holding <i class="calibre3">kīrtana</i> here, morning and evening if one is interested.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (2):</b> We have thirty Westerners there, that everyday we go to a Mahārāja's <i class="calibre3">darśana.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Thirty Westerners?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Do you have any, any other questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No, that's all. That just explains our presence here at the moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> You don't have to explain your presence in (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Thank you.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> She (Guest 3) was attending all the lectures at the <i class="calibre3">pandal</i> in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, I have seen her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> And Philadelphia also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, you understand our philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> Understand...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Our philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> Yes, I do. I think I do. (laughs) I was in New York at Hare Kṛṣṇa (indistinct) time, and we have a temple in our apartment, picture of the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> Philadelphia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> And we do the <i class="calibre3">āratik</i> and read all your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Which book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> <i class="calibre3">Śrī Īśopaniṣad, Lord Caitanya, Kṛṣṇa</i> book, (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Prabhupāda's going to put out a book called <i class="calibre3">Thus They Spoke,</i> with all the philosophers and refute them by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Refute them all (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Different schools of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yeah. Especially attacking Darwin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Darwinism. Yes, by all means. That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> They tried, but they weren't, they weren't God conscious. They were (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Hayagrīva:</b> The philosophers, you know, they were just men trying to figure, figure it out with their minds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They are all, so far we have studied all these philosophers, they (indistinct). They are lacking in knowledge. The main difference is that they consider the body as the self, and on that wrong basis they theorize (indistinct). If your basic standing is wrong, then how you can deliver the right? Therefore in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata, Śrīmad Bhāgavata,</i> it is said that <i class="calibre3">yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ:<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 10.84.13] "Anyone who considers this body as his self is no better than the ass and the cow." What is your philosophy? You consider this body as the self?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> I... Oh, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (2):</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Very good. So we begin by (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Uh, from the Rādhā Dāmodara. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> I've got three keys to that room open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Perhaps Subala has already made arrangements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, what is your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> My philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> The body is not the self. The self, or the <i class="calibre3">ātmān,</i> is the one absolute existence, but is has a delusive power whereby...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Who is that God? Delusive power?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b>  God, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> ...the <i class="calibre3">māyā,</i> the <i class="calibre3">māyā</i> of God makes, makes a man identify himself with his body, but it is, that's an illusion, and it's God's play that sometimes..., it's God's play that sometimes a man ignorantly identifies himself with the body, and through God's grace the bonds of ignorance are..., he is released from the bonds of ignorance through God's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> By God's grace, what happens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> One cannot... One achieves, one attains love for God, pure love. And, uh, by loving God, one, one, uh, one's..., one no longer identifies himself with his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So result of loving God, what it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Without loving God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Result is what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Of loving God? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What will come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Is union with God. Union with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> What is that union?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> What is union? Union, I think it, it's called yoga, or it's <i class="calibre3">samādhi</i>. I don't really know so much about it. Just what I've read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now what is the name, what you expressed by union? Just like you are there; I am here. You speak of union. What is the form of unity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> What is the form of unity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> My understanding is that, that, um, the spirit, God, the Supreme Spirit, is beyond form, but yet through loving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Beyond form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> ...through loving the form of God... It has form and yet it's formless. It's both..., has form and formless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that formlessness, and what is that form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> That I can't say. What do I know about these things? My own knowledge is just very slight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are not learning there, where you are staying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> I'm learning. I'm learning love. It's, Mahārāja..., this Nim Karoli Baba, has told us that love, love of God is the highest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But love, if you have no form where to love? The air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You love the form, it's true. You have <i class="calibre3">bhakti,</i> you love the form of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But you said it's formless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Ah, yes. Well, it's, uh, that, I've read the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How it is? How, if is formless, how you can love, enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You can't love the formless, it's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Fictitious love. Why don't you ask this intelligent question? If you say formless, then where is the love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> He doesn't teach the formless. That was my own view, but that is not anything that he's ever taught me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What does he teach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> He said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He teaches form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> He says that... Yes. He is a great <i class="calibre3">bhakta</i> of Hanumānji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Who is Hanumān?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Hanumān is the breath of Rāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> The breath of Rāma, <i class="calibre3">svasa.</i> <i class="calibre3">Rāma-ke-svasa</i>, breath of Rāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Breath?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> The breath. Hanumān was the... Rāma, Rāma once asked Hanumān, "What do you see? How do you see Me?'' and Hanumān answered, "When I know who I am, You and I are one, and when I forget who I am, then I serve you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's so nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Nonsense? Well, perhaps that's true. I don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> When you remember who you are you serve, and when you forget who you are, you think you're one with God. Just like suppose you sat in Nam Karoli's chair, just forgetting who you are, that his <i class="calibre3">chela,</i> his disciple, I'm Nam Karoli.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Nim Karoli.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Nim Karoli. Sorry. Similarly, when we forget who we are, we think we're one with God, but when we remember, we're His <i class="calibre3">bhakta</i>, we're His servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes, that's also true. It's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> When Hanumān, he's a great <i class="calibre3">bhakta.</i> We should follow in his footsteps. "One who says he is My devotee, he is not My devotee. One who says he is a devotee of My devotee, he is My devotee.'' Very humble. Then we can make advancement [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Mahārāja is teaching-you asked his teaching-these things are the same really, I, things that he's told me. But he said that the whole universe was God, and that you should never hurt anyone, that you should serve...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How you can serve whole universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> I beg your pardon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How you can serve whole universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> How can you serve the whole universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You love the beings that you find yourself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You love? To whom you love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Whoever you're with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Whatever, whatever...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is... Suppose you love me. You love the whole universe? Why this false impression?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Well certainly every being in the universe is a part of me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct). You can place your love to a particular person or particular community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Does it mean you love the whole universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like, just like nationalism. You are American?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So you have got your nationality. You love your country. But why you kill cows? Is that love of universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> If I love America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. You love your men, but you kill your cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> <i class="calibre3">Acchā.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Through ignorance. Men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then how you love the whole universe, if you are in ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You do your best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you are ignorant, you do not know how to love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> That's true, of course. Ignorance is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then how do you speak of universal love? When you do not know how to love, how do you speak universe, big, big word. You do not know the art of love, and you are speaking universal love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Well, certainly every...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is ignorance. First of all you say that you do not know how to love, and you are speaking of love the universe. It has already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Certainly each being in the universe is a part of the universe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But you cannot love each being. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They were hinting at it. She was saying if you love a pure being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You love the universe. Like you asked if I loved the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> She said that if you love a pure being, then you can love the universe. She stated that if you love a pure being then you can love the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then there is impure being and pure being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Is it a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then as soon as you say pure being, there is impure being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> It seems that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> The soul isn't impure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> The soul isn't impure. That's the only reality-purity of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You love God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Purity of the soul, that means there are impurity of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> It seems that way. It seems that there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> ...to my eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then you have to distinguish which is impure and which is pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> That's very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> I don't know what your saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> That there can be an impurity of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> He was asking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You said. You said purity of the soul. That means there must be the contradictory: impurity of soul. Then now we have to distinguish which is impure, which is pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> How can we distinguish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> In the absolute sense the soul is always pure, there is no impurity. But when man is in ignorance, as <i class="calibre3">māyā...</i> Śrī Kṛṣṇa's <i class="calibre3">yogamāyā</i>, His power of delusion, He can...., He makes you think, He makes you see impurity. You see suffering in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So wherefrom the <i class="calibre3">māyā</i> comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> From... I don't know, I can't answer that. It's, it's, it's God's nature, it's His <i class="calibre3">līlā</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> You stated that Kṛṣṇa makes us see impurity. Is this correct Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> That Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa makes us see impurity. He mentioned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> When a man is in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Well which is first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Which is first? Which, ignorance or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Does Kṛṣṇa make us in ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Well, He creates the whole universe and everything in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes. Śrīla Prabhupāda maybe you can explain that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Does Kṛṣṇa makes us ignorant or are we ignorant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> We are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> As he said, when you forget, you are in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Can you explain that a little bit more for us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He has already said. This forgetfulness is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes, forgetfulness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He knows that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> The sense of egoism, I and me and mine is ignorance. It's forgetting that God is everything and that you are nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That God and you are different, because you forget God, (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> (indistinct) .... and we forget, so they must be different. We're impure and He's pure, so we're different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Actually that's the best attitude.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> So to understand how we're different means we're in knowledge, not ignorance. And then what to do with that understanding means that not seeming. You said it seems, but we're saying not seems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> That's because my, I've read some other things, some other types of thoughts. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, (indistinct), the universe is God, then you are also God. Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes, that follows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then, how you become ignorant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> That's a mystery. That's something I can't explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Everything is mystery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Is that your... Is that a mystery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> You understand. Well, that's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> (indistinct). Śrīla Prabhupāda. He has made us, <i class="calibre3">oṁ ajñāna timirāndasya, </i>that by the torchlight of knowledge, he has opened my eyes. There's one Sanskrit poem,</div>
<div class="Verse">oṁ ajñāna-timirāndhasya<br class="calibre2"/>jñānāñjana śalākayā<br class="calibre2"/>cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena<br class="calibre2"/>tasmai śrī gurave namaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">By the torchlight of knowledge he has opened my darkened eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Everything is a mystery, but if someone who knows that mystery tells you the answer then you can know, then it ceases to be a mystery. But you can't find out on your own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No, you can't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Prabhupāda was the other day saying that we're the, we have the science of love of God. Many people say, the material scientists say perhaps or about 5,000 years ago such and such happened, but we say 485 years ago Lord Caitanya came. Five thousand years ago such and such happened. There <i class="calibre3">are</i> 8,400,000 species of life, not <i class="calibre3">perhaps</i> there are 8,400,000. So, this is very scientific, this relationship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is very difficult for the Māyāvādī philosophers to answer, that everyone is God but when God becomes ignorant? And what kind of God He is that He forgets and becomes ignorant? In <i class="calibre3">māyā</i>. So <i class="calibre3">māyā</i> becomes better than God? Is it not? Then what is the definition of God? So many things. But they cannot answer. Just like you said that when you become ignorant (indistinct) God, how it happens? (indistinct). God, how God can be ignorant? And how can God become forgetful? It is contradictory. Then what kind of God he is, that he becomes ignorant sometimes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> And if it's Kṛṣṇa's <i class="calibre3">yogamāyā</i> that makes us forgetful and makes God forgetful, that means Kṛṣṇa's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No, no, He's the Lord of <i class="calibre3">māyā</i>. He, Kṛṣṇa's pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Kṛṣṇa's the Lord of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes, of course. Kṛṣṇa never forgets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> <i class="calibre3">Māyā's</i> also Kṛṣṇa's servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now (indistinct) That's right. If Kṛṣṇa does not forget, then Kṛṣṇa is God, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then why not take Kṛṣṇa <i class="calibre3">līlā</i> study? Why go to others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Well, I have. I try to the best of my ability, I've read the <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i>, the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What Kṛṣṇa says, what Kṛṣṇa says, if Kṛṣṇa is God and Kṛṣṇa is never forgetful, then why not go to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> He says he's read the <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> and the <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>. So what has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Reading is not, I mean to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Of course not, reading is very (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...to understand Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says <i class="calibre3">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.7]<i class="calibre3">, </i> there is no more greater truth than Me. <i class="calibre3">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 5.29], I am the Lord of all the planetary systems, <i class="calibre3">sarva-loka</i>. So why should you go to others if you think that Kṛṣṇa is God, there is no greater personality than Kṛṣṇa? Take the instruction from Kṛṣṇa. It is very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Where is Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh? To take instruction from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Of course. As much as He allows me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, He allows everything. What is the difficulty? Kṛṣṇa says, <i class="calibre3">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</i> [Bg. 18.66], you give up everything just surrender unto Me. So if you surrender (indistinct), but if you don't that is your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> How does one surrender?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is another thing. You do not know then, you have to learn who I will surrender, but the position is this, Kṛṣṇa says that you surrender unto Me. You can surrender immediately. Surrender means just like in war field there is surrender: "(indistinct) now. Now sir, you surrender. Now whatever you like you can do." That is surrender. "If you like, kill me, and if you like, keep(?) me. That is surrender. It is very simple thing. In the war field when other party is defeated, the holds the hand, surrender. That means "If you like kill me, I throw down my weapon. If you like, save me." So He is the Supreme. If He likes He can kill me, if He likes He can save me, so I am subordinate. How can, I can do equally Kṛṣṇa? As soon as you surrender, it is accepted that you are predominated and He is predominator. So how you, the predominated, can be equal to the predominator?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Can't be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> He is the Lord (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> The thing you said when you came in was that we merge with something which is formless beyond Kṛṣṇa, the first...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No, it's not beyond Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If he has read <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>, that he cannot say, because Kṛṣṇa says <i class="calibre3">brahmaṇo ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā</i>, I am the resort of Brahman. So He is greater than Brahman. <i class="calibre3">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</i>, even Brahman<i class="calibre3"> </i>emanates from Me, and actually it is so. Just like the sunshine (indistinct) sun globe. Although the sunshine is universe(?), but still dependent on the sun globe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Of course that's true. There's nothing beyond Kṛṣṇa, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's good(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Very nice (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Very good. He's(?) good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I have a question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> If unity means to agree in purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Then what is that purpose? What is Kṛṣṇa's purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is living force. He has got different purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Don't say that Kṛṣṇa has only one purpose, that only purpose is that you surrender. Now, when you surrender, whatever Kṛṣṇa says you do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Oh. So His purpose is individual for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Varieties of purposes. Kṛṣṇa is asking Arjuna to fight with the Kurus, or He's asking me to preach. I am not fighting. So Kṛṣṇa, (indistinct), He has got varieties of order, and your duty is to carry out the order of Kṛṣṇa, that's all. What kind of order He'll give, you accept, just like you are doing, all my disciples. It is not that you are all doing the same thing. Somebody is <i class="calibre3">pūjārī</i>, somebody is preaching, somebody is collector, somebody is (indistinct), somebody is this, somebody is that. So there are different varieties, but your duty is to carry out my order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Just like you're satisfying us all, Kṛṣṇa satisfies everyone, (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Surrender means, whatever is favorable for Kṛṣṇa we apply, that's all. You cannot say, just like Arjuna, he first of all declined, "Kṛṣṇa, I am not going to fight.'' That is not surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> "I'll do whatever you want, but don't ask me to fight."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You cannot deny Him. That is surrender. Then, when he understood <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> he said "Yes, I shall do that.'' So long I deny Kṛṣṇa that is disunity, and as soon as I agree, "Kṛṣṇa, yes.'' Then this unity. Unity does not mean that Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna become united, homogeneous. No. Kṛṣṇa is distinct and Arjuna. They continue to exist. In the beginning Arjuna was denying to fight. That is dependence(?), and at the end when he said, "Yes, <i class="calibre3">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 18.73], my illusion is now over. That is (indistinct). Unity does not mean one's self loses individuality. That is cannot, that cannot be. Kṛṣṇa says that "both you and me and all these soldiers and Kings they existed before, now we are existing and we shall exist in future(?). So, that individuality is always kept. So unity means agreeing with the order of Kṛṣṇa, and disunity means not agreeing with the order. Otherwise your existence(?), mine and Kṛṣṇa's existence, always will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Sometimes people ask what is, what is God's ultimate goal? What is, why is God creating everything and are all these manifestations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> These are very old questions. These are not very intelligent questions. God is not creating. God is giving you chance. The conditioned souls who are not with Kṛṣṇa, they wanted to enjoy this material world. Therefore God is giving them chance. "All right enjoy (indistinct),'' and giving instruction also that you enjoy in this way, so that you may come back again. Just like a father. Children wants to play in the (indistinct). "All right, you play.'' Then, as soon as he asks, "Please come back. (indistinct), they come back. Similarly this material world, we wanted to enjoy, so Kṛṣṇa has given us freedom, "All right enjoy". And now Kṛṣṇa gives instruction that "now you give up all this (indistinct) come back, then you (indistinct).'' He created for you. Same example I always give. Just like the government, when there is formation of the city, jail construction is also there. You cannot say that, "Why government is creating, it is unnecessary, it's premature, construction of jail work(?). But the government knows that there are some criminals who has to be put into the jail. Therefore the jail created. So because there are criminals, therefore government creates. Similarly, there are many conditioned souls who, instead of serving Kṛṣṇa, they want to enjoy. "All right, for you, you enjoy to your fullest extent.'' And when he is tired of enjoying, enjoying, enjoying. Then Kṛṣṇa says that, "If you give up all this nonsense, just surrender to Me, you will be accepted.'' But the demons will never surrender to Kṛṣṇa. They say that this material world is false and Brahman is truth, but they do not know how to act as Brahman. Brahman means to stop. That is <i class="calibre3">nirviśeṣavāda</i> and <i class="calibre3">śūnyavāda</i>, to become void. But you cannot become void. If I say "Mr. such and such, you sit down here, try to become void,'' how long you shall do that, void?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No, that's impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's impossible. So this is a wrong theory. Because I am a living entity, I have got my activities. I can remain void for few seconds, for few minutes. (Guests enter and pay obeisances) Very glad to see you. (indistinct-break)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> As I understand (indistinct). The export minister (indistinct). (indistinct) C. D. Gupta, the old chief minister, you see. He is coming and I take they have arranged a program in his honor. I don't know how they will make this program fit in. I don't think..., huh? [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> ...an Indian edition of it. We should let Dr. Karan Singh patronize an Indian edition of it, without, with one photo. As he was suggesting, let him patronize it, the Indian printing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Because there is so much demand. He wants to see it. He wants to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So why don't you get the manuscript and let us have an Indian edition. I told Rūpānuga that the difficulty is that the enlarged edition when we are attempting to publish, MacMillan says that "We are publishing your book, why not we, we publish.'' If we publish, then we save our investment to publish. That has not been decided, so therefore I advised my secretary in New York that MacMillan's permission or no permission, you should immediately print. If they print it is all right, otherwise print ourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Haven't you given the copyright to them?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In India, yes. No, by publisher, especially publisher like MacMillan you save so much time and investment also. We are not for profit. We want to see the publication in the market, so in that sense we save so much trouble, but they always look after their business profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In the beginning also I requested them to publish the whole, but they said, "No, it will be very big, it will be costly. You reduce it to 400 pages.'' So that 1100 pages were reduced to 400 pages. Now when people are demanding this <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> As It Is, people are coming. When our <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i> party goes in the street many gentlemen comes and demands "Have you got Bhaktivedanta's <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> As It Is?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dr. Kapoor:</b> Hm, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, they demand it. In every center it is going on very nicely. Then we have many customer requested the enlarged edition. So, so everything is ready. Now this controversy, whether MacMillan will publish or we shall publish.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That I am trying, but it has not been decided, but anyway it will be published very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Even if they do publish it, they will not distribute it in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, in that sense we may publish in India.</div>
