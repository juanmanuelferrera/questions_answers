<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that sex is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not missed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt. Viṣaya,</span> the four things-eating, sleeping, mating, defending-in any condition of life they're available. They're available. It doesn't matter in what condition of life you are living, but these things are available. <span class="Italic">Viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt. Sarvataḥ</span> means everywhere, in any condition. This is available. And still, people are busy for these four things. Good morning. (to passers-by) That is assured, that any condition of life, you'll have these four things. <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore we should not endeavor for these four things. That is already fixed. I'll get in any condition of life. Then? What for our energy should be employed? Which was not available, wandering up and down, beginning from the heavenly planet down to the Pluto's planet. This is a passenger ship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They stand there, and passengers come here? Through boats?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. The ships like this go around the Orient, to japan and Indonesia. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Are the shoes comfortable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...available in any condition of life. People are making gorgeous arrangement for that thing. <span class="Italic">Viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt. Viṣaya,</span> material necessities, they are available...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passers-by:</span> Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good morning. In any condition of life: birds, bees, insect, vagabond, wretched... Everyone will get it. [break] ...motorcars, in your country. If somehow or other, one can secure one motorcar, then life is secure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> He very feels secure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, yes. He feels he has freedom. He can go anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only depend on motorcar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. Now everyone is very fearful because there is no gas for the motorcar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They say that a man walking in the street does not feel so big, but once he gets behind the wheel of the motorcar he becomes very puffed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is natural. He thinks, "I am motorcar." He identifies. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We say sense gratification is available for everyone, but they don't agree. They think, "If I don't have this nice apartment it's not the same as sleeping in a bad condition."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bad condition, good condition, that is another thing. But you get it. You get it. Bad condition, good condition, that is my consideration, but things are available. Even the best apartment in India, that is not a good apartment for America. This is simply my mental concoction: "This is good; that is bad." I am thinking, "It is the best;" another may think, "Oh, it is lowest." The hog is thinking stool is very nice food, and I am thinking, "What is this nonsense thing?" So "best" and "good", it is simply mental concoction, it has no value. Just like these western people, what is their ultimate standard of best, nobody knows. Nobody knows. Just like hundred years before, there was no skyscraper building, but now even best skyscraper building is not best. So where is the standard of best and... It is all mental concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Just like in New York, at one time the Empire State Building was the biggest; now they have built two buildings that are the biggest in the world now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now someday it will be lowest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, already in Chicago they're building one, a Sears building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the standard of best and lowest. There is no standard. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Many philosophers have tried to define what is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Many philosophers have tried to define what is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They have no Absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They have no idea. Mental speculators, they are no good. (wind noise) Mental speculator means <span class="Italic">harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā manorathena</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">, manorathena</span> by the mental plane, airship, he's simply hovering. They have no standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So a devotee does not have to cogitate too much. Whatever satisfies Kṛṣṇa, that is best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Kṛṣṇa is best. That's all. And whatever is done for Kṛṣṇa, that is best. That's all. We have got a standard; therefore we are satisfied. "Even in distressed condition, because Kṛṣṇa has given me distress, so-called distress, it is not distress. So this is all right." Because here, distress or happiness, they are simply mental concoction. <span class="Italic">Dvaite bhadra...</span> I am in the material existence-that is my distress. That distress has to be removed, not this temporary distress or happiness. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But when we try to help people in that way, they don't care for our help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We try to give people that. They don't want that; they want temporary help.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. They are mad. Still, we have to do that. Madmen does not, he doesn't think that "I require anyone's help." But still, the father, mother, guardian, government, gives him help. We are not dependent on their decision; we are dependent on Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, <span class="Italic">para-duḥkha-duḥkhī:</span> Vaiṣṇava is unhappy seeing others unhappy. Otherwise, they have no unhappiness. They are unhappy seeing that "This rascal is unnecessarily suffering." That is unhappiness of Vaiṣṇava. <span class="Italic">Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa...</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "I have no, any problem, but I'm simply thinking of these rascals, that for some temporary happiness they make so gorgeous arrangement, and forgotten their real business." Just like all these... What is this city? At any moment, it will be finished, but... Just like they're flying, fleeing some other place, "America will be destroyed." So why they have spoiled so much energy? They do not know where to apply the energy for real benefit. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Therefore they have been called as <span class="Italic">mūḍha, duṣkṛtina, duṣkṛtina:</span> showing very good merit for this big, big building, big, big road... <span class="Italic">Kṛti, kṛti</span> means meritorious. But <span class="Italic">duṣkṛti. Duṣkṛti</span> means for useless purpose, real purpose missing. They have no information of the soul within the body; simply they are engaged in the bodily activities. The soul is neglected.</div>
<div class="Verse">māyār bośe, jāccho bhese',<br class="calibre2"/>kāccho hābuḍubu bhāi</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...at least one verse of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> every one of you, and try to understand scrutinizingly, life will be successful. At least one verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Every day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every day. Why I am taking so much trouble? Everything enlightened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I was reading yesterday about the talks between Uddhava and Maitreya and Kṛṣṇa, and it described that previously Uddhava was one of the eight Vasus who desired to associate with the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> What is exactly the position of the Vasus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vasus, they are demigods. Before appearance of Kṛṣṇa, some of the exalted demigods were ordered to come and arrange for His arrival. So Uddhava arrived, and many others arrived. They were coming from heavenly planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Bhīṣmadeva was also one of the Vasus previously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Aṣṭa-vasu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> In Bhīṣmadeva's instructions, while he was dying, one of the questions that he was asked is "Which is more powerful, action or destiny, <span class="Italic">karma?"</span> He replied that they are both very powerful, but of the two, action was more powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Time. Reaction. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... What is that bird? (tropical-sounding bird in background) Bird, or something else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Bird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That sound? [break] ...our philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness if they actually want to be happy. This is a fact. Not sentimentally, but scientifically, philosophically. Let them... Let the biggest scientists, biggest philosopher, come and understand. [break] ...gone away, but nobody saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah, they saw, but it was very faint. It was not as bright as was expected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> It did not collide. It did not hit the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. But only they saw?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, it was visible to the naked eye, but very faintly, not as bright as it was predicted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They had predicted that it was going to be as bright as three...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...millions times...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> ...moons, like a full moon night. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...predictions were going around about the end of the earth was coming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> End of the earth. Forty... They said they had forty days, forty days left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How rascals they are, just see. I never believed. How shall I believe? I know it cannot be done. That <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets,</span> I have described the moon-going-plan-a childish. Did I not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The cloud is not big, as big as the sky. Similarly, the material world is also... It is insignificant in comparison to the spiritual world. Some portion of it is covered by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> just like this cloud. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passer-by:</span> Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good morning. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] <span class="Italic">...jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.</span> How one bird or flower should be beautiful, nicely decorated? Kṛṣṇa gives His energy only a little and everything is there. <span class="Italic">Svā-bhāvikī jñāna...</span> Just as if a very good artist has painted nicely. <span class="Italic">Svā-bhāvikī-jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.</span> How to do it, that Kṛṣṇa knows. That is His inconceivable energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> So then like the sunset; that is also Kṛṣṇa's artistry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. [break] <span class="Italic">...māṁ paśyati sarvatra sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati.</span> That is advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: everywhere one sees Kṛṣṇa, and in Kṛṣṇa he sees everything. Therefore he sees Kṛṣṇa only. He sees nothing. And the atheist will say, "Where is Kṛṣṇa?" And advanced devotee will say, "Everywhere Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">antar bahiḥ,</span> inside and outside." <span class="Italic">Nato nāṭya dharo yathā</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Then it is a devotee's misconception if he thinks that Kṛṣṇa is outside everywhere, but He's not in the temple. Because I remember...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not a devotee, he's a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, because in one of your... in <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion,</span> you explain about some Māyāvādīs. Sometimes they think that Kṛṣṇa is not in the Deity but He is everywhere else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his rascaldom. And these ships require huge quantities of petrol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Many ships now, they are lying idle in the ports for lack of petrol. (end)</div>
