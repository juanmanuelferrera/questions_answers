<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot give up this habit. A dog is made king, but he will jump and lick up the shoes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> (in background) Glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [Break] It is the grace of Providence you do not see that it is properly cleansed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> I'm sorry. I will see to that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> Your Divine Grace. That is my fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why there is water? This water means the shoes, dirt, it will be dirty. So you have no eyes to see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> I am blind. I am sorry. I will see that it is cleaned for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then become with eyes. Simply praying, what you will do? Do something practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is the argument people always throw against us. "Simply praying, what will you do? Do something practical." They say this all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee or Vraja-vāsī:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So they are guests. They are coming. Kṛṣṇa says everything practical. He never says that "You press your nose and everything will come." He never said like that. "You become a yogi by pressing your nose, and keep your head downward, and then you'll become perfect and everything will come." He never says. And Arjuna also never accepts anything impractical. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> As soon as Kṛṣṇa said that "You practice yoga by this way " immediately Kṛṣṇa said "My dear Kṛṣṇa it is not possible, for me. I cannot control my mind." <span class="Italic">Vāyor eva suduskara.</span> "It is impossible as to control the air." If somebody says, "I shall control the air..." So these things are there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> all practical. Kṛṣṇa was accepted the Supreme Lord by His practical instruction and practical features. They are not following Kṛṣṇa themselves also. That is the difficulty. [break] What is going on here? [Break] Private. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Rudra-yajña.</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody is exploiting. <span class="Italic">Rudra-yajña.</span> [break] ...any mention of <span class="Italic">Rudra-yajña?</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the word is <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra.</span> Where is <span class="Italic">Rudra-yajña?</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> How does one stop cheating in a world of cheats?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This material world is meant for cheating. You cheat, and others will cheat you. That's all. This is material world. It is not "how?" If you inquire, "How it is cold?"... The season is cold. There is no question of how. The place is for cheating and cheaters. So there is no question, "How it is cheating?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So you can't stop the cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You can't stop the cheaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes, it is not possible. But you can do everything by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the advantage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot get out of sinful action, but Kṛṣṇa can do it. Therefore He says, "I'll get you released." You cannot get released; therefore He says, "I'll do that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So bringing it to a practical platform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical means it will be done by Kṛṣṇa. Your only business is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. You cannot do anything. And as soon as you think that "I shall be able to do it," then you are a rascal. Immediately you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So only a fully surrendered soul can do everything perfectly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A fully surrendered soul is the only one who can do things perfectly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot do anything, even in his... Everything is to be done by Kṛṣṇa. But he has to apply his intelligence by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Even if he is intelligent, he cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Except surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He can surrender, and Kṛṣṇa will do everything. You have to act very sincerely under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, and then the war will be successful, as Arjuna did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So imperfect activity is a sign of lack of surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">...avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa. Rakṣiṣyati iti viśvāsa-pālanam.</span> You work sincerely, devoutly, and have faith that "Kṛṣṇa will save me from all dangers." <span class="Italic">Rakṣiṣyati iti viśvāsa-pālanam.</span> "I have surrendered to Kṛṣṇa sincerely. Now Kṛṣṇa will give me all protection." This faith, that is the beginning of devotional life. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So this faith, is this <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> or <span class="Italic">niṣṭha?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā.</span> Beginning, <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span> Then, when he is advanced, then he becomes fixed up. "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is protecting me." [break] ...that here is some goddess Kali, and nobody is living here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, and then they worship in that temple. That's a temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. No, the road is, er, gate is closed. [break] People in general, they take that "There is no God, and if there is God, He is now dead." This is general impression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There is one nice thing I saw on one wall. It says, "God is dead. Nietzche "And then right underneath it somebody wrote, "Nietzche is dead. God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nietzche? Nietzche means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nietzche, that philosopher. He was the one who first...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nietzche first brought up the philosophy of "Everything is nothing," for the Western people. "It's all nothing. It all ultimately boils down to nothing. So there is no possibility of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādī. Śūnyavādī.</span> That is <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī. Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādī. Śūnyavādī,</span> they say, "There is no God, and there is nothing, fact. Everything is combination of some illusory things." This is <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī.</span> And the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī,</span> they say, "Yes, there is God, but He has no form." Therefore we have to kill both of them. <span class="Italic">Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavād-pāścātya-deśa-tāriṇe.</span> The whole Western world are filled up with these <span class="Italic">śūnyavādi</span> and impersonalists. India is also nowadays, but there are, still there are devotees in the <span class="Italic">ācārya-sampradāya.</span> They are fighting against <span class="Italic">śunyavāda</span> and <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In South India I think a lot of the Rāmānuja followers are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> If everything was void, then there would be no hope for living. So might as well die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. By combination, permutation, you create, and if you don't want it, then avoid this combination. [break] Even in four o'clock time, visiting, if he comes at four o'clock, you let him come in. [break] ...Gurukula we require teachers for teaching the small children. So our, these girls, they cannot take this charge of teaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, one is already teaching now. One is already teaching children now, one girl.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Her name is Ruth. She's English. Every afternoon she teaches the children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's also one in Bombay. She used to be a public school teacher in England. After the school is open she can come over here. And there's one in Māyāpur, but she's teaching in Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, other girls, they can take up this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...our guest. Because somebody is guest, paying guest, therefore we shall admit anyone in any kind of dress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't admit people who look like hippies or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That girl, I told her she had to wear a <span class="Italic">sari.</span> And she did for some time, but then again she stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am speaking, that <span class="Italic">sa yadi krīyate rāja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Due to habit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sakrn nasnuta pahanam</span> (?) That is the difficulty. It will be very bad example. People will think... They already thinking that "These are all hippies." That will minimize the prestige of the temple. [break] Jaipuria House they do not allow any hippies. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jaipuria does not allow any foreigners at all. They don't allow any foreigners at all, even if somebody is decently dressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> One boy came a couple of weeks ago. He had long hair. But the next day he came back and shaved up. He's a devotee now. He's doing nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So they will still come. They can become devotees. It's all right then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...doing, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If they come and they have long hair but if there's a chance they might become devotees, I tell them they must tie up their hair in such a way that you cannot see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. If many comes like that to become devotee, then it becomes a devotee place, er, hippie place. You give them chance to become a devotee. In the meantime, it will be known as a hippie resort.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's always been a problem here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is no problem. You can allow for three days only. If he does not change his habit, then he must go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. all right. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...was in the beginning allowing, but they saw some disadvantage. Therefore they have stopped. [break] ...our Dhanañjaya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's sick.</div>
