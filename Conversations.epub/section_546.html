<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and is still going on all over the world. So what is the use of observing centenary (centennial?) for a dead system of religion, and which is not very old, not even hundred years? So what is the use? <span class="Italic">Maṇḍanam loka-rañjanam. Aprāṇasya hi dehasya maṇḍana,</span> with the body which is already dead, if you decorate it, it may be very pleasing to some, <span class="Italic">loka-rañjanam,</span> but it has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, sometimes during your lectures I hear you say <span class="Italic">yata mat tata mat?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">yata mat tata path.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What does that mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vivekananda's philosophy. "Whatever opinion you have got, that is also nice." That means even if we differ, your opinion, my opinion, your is good and my is good. That means no controversy, that's all: making compromise. If I say, "Your, your whatever you think..." This is going on. When Gandhi was approached that "You have got so much influence on the Mohammedans. Why don't you stop this cow slaughter?" Gandhi said, "No, it is their religion. I cannot stop." That is <span class="Italic">yata mat,</span> that "Cow slaughter is also good, and cow not slaughter is also good." (chuckles) This is their philosophy. [break] What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yātrā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yātrā.</span> To collect some money, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then they arrange it so that they save the balance expenses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the meaning of <span class="Italic">yātrā.</span> Every one of our Godbrothers built here <span class="Italic">yātrā,</span> but they have no other source of income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yesterday I was speaking to... I invited the chief guest, so I was speaking with... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsīra alpa chidra bahu-kori mane.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> During the <span class="Italic">āratiks</span> here at the temple where should the women be standing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āratik,</span> there are so many. That also... Caitanya Mahā..., saw Jagannātha. There was crowd. One woman got up on His shoulder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> During the <span class="Italic">āratik.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> During... And he was seeing, and everyone saying, "Get! Get down!" Caitanya said, "No, don't disturb. Let her see. She has got so much eagerness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we cannot imitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imitation is always bad. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Imitation is always bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu have a <span class="Italic">daṇḍī</span> or a <span class="Italic">tridaṇḍī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Daṇḍī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ekadaṇḍī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> from Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why did Nityānanda Prabhu break His <span class="Italic">daṇḍa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not require any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> After taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> though, He had <span class="Italic">śikha</span> and <span class="Italic">Tulasī mālā?</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was Māyāvādī. (chuckles) (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Someone wrote that only Caitanya Mahāprabhu can say <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> He is the only Māyāvādī who can actually say <span class="Italic">aham brahmāsmi,</span> because He is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is <span class="Italic">brahmāsmi,</span> no. He is <span class="Italic">parabrahmāsmi. Kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmine.</span> (end)</div>
