<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda! <span class="Italic">Nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya...</span> (offers obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> Rāmeśvara Mahārāja!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was just talking about you, that "When Rāmeśvara is coming? What is time?" Very good, early in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you look well. Are you feeling well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the present moment I am feeling well because you are here. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā</span> from Los Angeles temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, bring more money. (Hari-śauri laughs) [break] I am going to spend this money in huge advertisement propaganda. I have given him the idea. Because here in India we haven't got devotees pushing as in USA and America we have got our devotees. They are attacking and pushing. Here there is no such devotee. And therefore I have proposed huge, big advertisement in the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Paper and billboards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Especially newspapers. I have given the instruction. You are here, and you can arrange, three. I am reading the matter also like this. Read it. It is very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Read worldwide Hare Kṛṣṇa literatures and be happy. Books by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. 1) <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> Cantos 1-9, twenty-seven volumes, Rs..." (aside:) Not so many. Per volume. "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is; Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> seventeen volumes; <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya; The Nectar of Devotion; Śrī Īśopaniṣad; Easy Journey to Other Planets; Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, the Topmost Yoga System; Kṛṣṇa, The Supreme Personality of Godhead,</span> three volumes; <span class="Italic">Perfect Questions, Perfect Answers;</span> and so on. Recommended by learned scholars and professors all over the world. Available for reading from all university, college and public libraries of the world, and can be purchased."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can give the name of few leading bookstores in each city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not through bookstore. Only our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, and you can give that Calcutta agent, Vrnda Book... That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And for the books you have in Hindi you should write "available in Hindi."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Hindi we shall advertise differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Hindi papers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Advertise in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hindi, yes. And this is English. In this way I have given the idea. We'll make the space contract and ask them the concession, because it is charitable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That we will get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In this way immediately arrange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I can put one for next Wednesday's paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all take the rate. Then when we shall begin, that we shall decide. So Rāmeśvara is there. He has got very good experience in everything. How do you like this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's excellent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then it is final. (laughter) Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think... What if we mentioned how many copies of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> have been sold in the last year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we can say "sold to date." I tell people over four million copies sold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is not required. We are selling all worldwide. That is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And also the American universities are using these books in their courses as required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have said, "Available for reading from university, public libraries all over the world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Before you said that we should put also a line that "These books are available in all major languages of the world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not very important. "All over the world" means it is understood in all other languages. Otherwise how they are reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In Europe when men go to the libraries, sometimes they don't speak English. So they're already taking standing orders for the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> in French and other languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make this immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is the notice of the money we just sent to Bombay from Los Angeles, seventy thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now do the needful about this. And the invoice? You have sent the books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these books are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Now I have everything in stock. We have everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And which we have not got stock you print here. Keep for sufficient stock, in this way. So I was asking last night that at least in Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, simply whatever collection is there, fifty percent print books and fifty percent spend for temple or for pushing on the books. No money available. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is always the situation. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) As soon as there will be money, there will be headache and income tax, this tax, that tax. So keep always empty. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> Vigorously push, and whatever available, spend. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> Finished. How do you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is always our policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. And if we have to take contribution, take ISKCON. They're free. But for Bhaktivedanta Trust there is no need of contribution. Then there will be exemption certificate required and so on. We don't want any contribution. If anyone wants to contribute, let him contribute to the ISKCON. They're tax free. And here there is no tax, no tax free. That's all. Print book and sell and spend. Follow this policy there and here also, and push these books. That is our main preaching. Somehow or other, it must go, from door to door, hand to hand. Then our preaching is successful. Anyone who will read, he'll get some benefit. That is sure, because such literatures are not available throughout the whole world. It is a new revolution to the people in general. Am I right or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. (laughs) Then do it now. And I shall spend all this money for advertisement. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One of the biggest bookstores in Bombay, International Book House, has arranged a whole window display of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many people were seeing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless. I know these men. But you can get some customers. That's all right. Do they purchase or simply display?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. They purchase also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually in Belgium the National Museum has also set up in their main window a display of your books. And that's very good for a museum, because they do not sell there, but they are considering it so important and scholarly that they are displaying them for the public to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good recommendation, yes. If that museum is so important, so to keep our books there is prestigious. In Europe, America, it is going on nice. Now here we have to take advantage of these papers. So I have already given Jagadīśa the idea. Now you immediately put into effect. You keep that also with your papers, this format. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Will there be an address on the advertisement for people to write to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The Book Trust office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you take your rest now. Then you shall come and go on talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I'm not actually tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's not tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I'm feeling completely rejuvenated just seeing you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān.</span> This kind of <span class="Italic">utsāhā</span> required. <span class="Italic">Utsāhā</span> means enthusiasm. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān dhairyāt.</span> So did you write to Dr. Sukla for sending the translation? So do it enthusiastically. It is a new peaceful revolution throughout the whole world. What other news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually it's not so peaceful in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America there are some atheists who are organizing constantly to attack us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is peaceful. That will bring peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. I was seeing it. Because now it has become such a controversy that the biggest television and radio programs are begging us, "Come on my show and explain the issue, whether you are brainwashing." So we have been already invited to be on the biggest nationwide television programs, and we're on radio...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you are presenting nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Usually what they do is they bring someone on the show to ask us questions, and this person is very demoniac. He distorts and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they should question? We shall explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, we get the opportunity to, but that's how they set it up. In other words, they want to see us defeated, but in the end they are always defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is in our charge. Yes. They are afraid of their demonic civilization being killed by this movement. That is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are combining together. The demons, without illicit sex, without intoxication, without meat-eating, without gambling, their life is finished. So they are thinking, "How we shall live if this movement is allowed to make progress like epidemic?" And that is the idea behind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are always saying that "Actually we are not brainwashing; you are brainwashing. You are convincing the people there is no God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are presenting God, His address, His father's name, His residence, everything. If you are intelligent, you can go back home, back to Godhead. If not, you may suffer. Others will go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That example you gave of the dead husband... Prabhupāda gave an analogy, it is very good. To indicate who is being brainwashed. The example was a dead husband is calling his wife. That is very good example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're actually doing service because they are forcing all these newspapers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Hare Kṛṣṇa-this name has become popular all over the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. (to Gopāla?) You have experience. (laughs) The learned people in America are very concerned that we are being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harassed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...harassed, and they are organizing groups to defend us. In Harvard University...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...the biggest professors and theologians have organized now a nationwide committee to defend us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And also the lawyers and psychologists are also organizing in their own fields nationwide committees just to defend us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is so much mercy from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wanted all these things. Unless there is... Kṛṣṇa became important when He killed so many demons, not lying down on the lap of mother Yaśodā. And while He was on the lap of mother Yaśodā, from that day He began to kill. He began to kill. And there was attack. Therefore Kṛṣṇa became the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So even Kṛṣṇa was not exempted, what to speak of us. Prahlāda Mahārāja was not exempted. As soon as you speak of God, this opposition will come. Jesus Christ was crucified. So they are so kind they have not crucified me or my men. (laughs) Otherwise you have to expect all these things. Nityānanda Prabhu was personally injured. So these are the... Haridāsa Ṭhākura was beaten in twenty-two bazaars. This task is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are getting everyone in America to ask the question, "What is Hare Kṛṣṇa?" Because of all their false propaganda, everyone is asking, "What is Hare Kṛṣṇa? What is Hare Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is our triumph. They're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I read that even the <span class="Italic">New York Daily News</span> took a poll to find out. They were asking every person what they think about Hare Kṛṣṇa. Usually they only take polls for very important issues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, but it was terrible. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The poll?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">Dialectic Spiritualism</span> is published?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This year, after the Māyāpura Festival. Hayagrīva hasn't finished working on it completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many pages it will be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Two volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two volumes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Two volumes, eight hundred pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh? So, big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that Harikeśa's book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda explaining the different philosophies of the world. This was something that just appeared just before I left Los Angeles. This shows how they are fighting back. This a four-page article... [break] ...as if it is a very nice thing. And they say in the article that the parents have to pay these professionals $25,000 just to steal a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Heavy tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We don't pay them anything. They come to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are getting advertise, publicity, paying nothing. This is our profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We still have to work very hard to defeat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is necessary. You don't sleep. Never Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna that "I am your friend. I am God. You sleep here. (laughter) I'll do everything." No! "You must fight." That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Yuddhyasva mām anusmara: [</span>Bg. 8.7<span class="Italic">]</span> "You fight and remember Me. Then I'll do everything." This is an opportunity of remembering Kṛṣṇa always-"Kṛṣṇa, save us." [break] So what are these pictures? Against us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. This shows that if they kidnap you and they convince you to give up your belief in God, you will be very happy. You will have nice girlfriend. You will be very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> This material world means this sex. That is happiness. And we are saying, "Don't enjoy this happiness like hogs." <span class="Italic">Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> "This kind of happiness available in the hog's life, dog's life. Why you are anxious for this happiness?" This is our philosophy. Real happiness? <span class="Italic">Tapo divyam:</span> just undergo some austerity for attaining Kṛṣṇa. This is our.... How they will understand it? Therefore they are thinking, "Unless there is brainwash, how this philosophy is being preached?" Just opposite. They are thinking, "This is happiness," and we are condemning, "This is happiness of the hogs." Actually that is.... Hog is also enjoying that sex without any discrimination whether it is mother or sister or daughter. That is going on. Sex must be there. It doesn't matter who is. This is the world's position, hog civilization. Why a person is condemned as hog, especially in India? He's our "sewer <span class="Italic">kavaca.</span>" Why? The hog has no discrimination of sex. No animal has got, especially this hog. You'll find a study, that one side, drinking the milk, and next, plies over him. Cannot reach. Still, hog wants.... Small kiddies for sex. That sex desire is so strong from the very beginning of.... And no sense that "It is my mother."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, I've seen that in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Nature's study gives the... And therefore <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> gives the example: "Don't work so hard simply for hog civilization." So if we use this word-it is very, very harsh for the Western people-"It is the hog civilization," actually it is so. But you cannot say. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ priyaṁ vada...</span> Unless it is palatable, you cannot say straight. That is... They take it seriously that "You are criticizing our mode of life." Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Dr. Patel enters) <span class="Italic">Aiye, aiye, aiye.</span> (Hindi-"Please come in")</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You're not going to walk upstairs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not yet six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I did not go for a walk today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You want to go to <span class="Italic">Māgha Mela</span>? Er...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kumbhamela?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> See, the thing is I am prepared to come, but difficulty would be to come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I would not stay all the time that you are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can help him get a ticket, because we have a letter of introduction from a very big Central Railway officer for the chief man in Allahabad at the Central Railway. He got us the tickets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or let us go by car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> By car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It would take three days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All right. I'll come with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall enjoy. We shall stop somewhere and have picnic. I like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your car from Vṛndāvana is reaching there. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So work very vigorously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I can record that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I can show you this later. This is a copy of a newsletter that we have intercepted from the enemy camp. We have our newsletter, and they also have their newsletter. So we have gotten ourselves on their mailing list, so we can find out all their strategy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When there is fight these things are studied. (Hindi) When there is fight there is no question of immoral or moral. "We must get victory," that's all. Kṛṣṇa did it. Kṛṣṇa asked...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> According to this, they've made it legal, deprogramming. They're making it legal that they can hold a person by force until they break him mentally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Rāmeśvara? Are there many of our devotees who've been deprogrammed, or are they mostly other groups?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Mostly the others. Śrīla Prabhupāda, the business of the Book Trust has gotten very big. So the warehouse in Los Angeles has become too small. So we have gotten a new warehouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got a warehouse like Howrah Station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a picture of the new building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Looks very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's not yet completed. They are building it just for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a picture of the side of the building. This truck holds 20,000 copies of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It's being unloaded into the warehouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These are pictures of the inside as we are beginning to fill it up with books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not yet filled up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It will be, very soon. This is part of it. We just moved in as I was leaving for India, so I had them shoot these pictures very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And the former warehouse... We now need more space for the dioramas. We're going to start manufacturing them for all the temples. So we're going to use the former warehouse, that you once visited, for Bharadrāja. He needs that much space because he's going to be making the dolls, then making a mold. Then once you have the mold, you can mass produce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that we can show in every center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. They'll make them out of a different substance so that they can be shipped, without breaking, all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The original doll will be straw and clay. But then for mass production it will be fiberglass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fiberglass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very hard and light. Not so heavy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not... What is called? Burn? Fire? Inflammable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, it is fireproof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That's all right. Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It will be permanent. Even if you brush into it, it will not break. Very durable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. You take rest. We shall go a little... (everyone leaves room) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've actually legalized it. There's one group, they're claiming that by deprogramming people they give him freedom of thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are... By deprogramming... They are thinking of Kṛṣṇa. You are checking. Where is the freedom of thought? Then you are illegal. They want to think of Kṛṣṇa, and you are checking. Then who is illegal? We have to put in that way, in their word, that "Then you have no right to check him about thinking of Kṛṣṇa." This will be our argument. Yes. How you can check? Let him think of Kṛṣṇa freely, because Kṛṣṇa wants. Then you have to take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as illegal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, if they condemn the whole thing, they have to condemn the whole, entire Hindu religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. We have to fight in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is really separating us from these other cults because most of these other cults, they have no defense because their whole thing is a concoction. But for ourselves, we're actually practicing a standard way of worship, and we have so many testimonials from actual Hindus themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, outside scholars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And from all the scholars and professors and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "It is bona fide thinking and you are checking."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What complicates it is they get ex-cult members to come and testify that "Yes, I was psychologically kidnapped. I was made into a robot just to think of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So the whole thing's become a very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to defend in our way. (end)</div>
