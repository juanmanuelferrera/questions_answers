<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some time must be taken, but unlimited time, unlimited expenditure, that's not good. Ten percent. You produce books. Take ten percent. You may have more than 1,500. You may have more than that. They were to send me one card. There are no letters from them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No. That's all that came, Prabhupāda. There were some more checks. I sent some to London. I sent two packages to London, two, two things to London. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, I was very much anxious to hear about Chidananda. So he has written me. He is not very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, he was in the hospital, and he got into a fight with the guard, I guess, and they arrested him for fighting and put him in jail for six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fighting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he is weak. With whom he'll fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. It was actually very... We have a lawyer working on it to get a suspended sentence. We've got a lawyer who is trying to get him a suspended sentence because he was sick and he..., they had him taking drugs and he was weak and he had been in the hospital for four months. Why they should put him in jail? He just got a little irritable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They mocked him. I think they mocked him for having this and finally he couldn't take any more, and he probably hit the guard, so they threw him in jail for six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> And in jail they won't give him anything to eat except... They won't give him a special diet, so all he can eat is just a little bit of vegetable. They have... On a plate they give him mostly meat and a little vegetable. They won't give him any extra vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes? Where the jail is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Which jail is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> County jail, Los Angeles County Jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we cannot send our <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No. They won't let anything in. You can't even send books there. They won't let him wear his beads. They won't let him have his beads or anything, or his sacred thread. They took it all away from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Can we go visit him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We can visit, yes. Visiting hours on Saturdays and Sundays. I went there the Saturday before last, before I came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how is he here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, he's doing all right. He says he chants and he prays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, what can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We're trying to see the minister there and get some books in to him. If the minister will allow it, we can give him books. Otherwise they won't let him have any books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you see or else why this poor fellow should be given unnecessary trouble. What is this? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Cardamom seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Yes. (devotees offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the price of a closet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> A closet? How big, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Maybe forty dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Steel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Oh, steel. Probably more than forty. Like a locker? A locker like this or a closet like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Closet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Closet. Probably sixty or seventy dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think it is much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We can get it. Six feet high?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> A wardrobe for clothes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Like a chefferon(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Made out of steel instead of wood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Steel is cheaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, steel is more. Wood is cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So steel is, I think, nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Okay. We'll look for one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And one stove.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> A small stove?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Two burners?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
