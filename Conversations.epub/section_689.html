<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda will speak in English or Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> ...you know Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which you...? No, just I want to end this verse. Shall I speak in Hindi or English? That I am...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hindi. (Hindi) You read it thoroughly and you explain it either in English or Hindi, as you think befitting to your friends. So we have got so many literatures in French language. We are also asking some men from Europe. That will create some impression. Yes. White elephant. (laughter) Dancing. Everyone will purchase ticket. Yes. (Hindi) Bring some white elephant. So literature is there. But one thing is that you must be placed in <span class="Italic">sadācāra,</span> well behaved. So you have to sacrifice, especially your long hair. And if you sacrifice your hair, we can export it and get some money. (laughter) Because in Western countries they want these hairs to make wigs. Yes. So just... (Hindi) As they have been trained up to rise early in the morning, this will give you spiritual strength. If you simply becomes a gramophone speaker, then it will not be effective. Gramophone or tape record speaker, that will not be. You must be live speaker. Your living condition should be spiritually, what is called, surcharged. So that means you must be trained up how to rise early in the morning, take your bath, cleanse yourself, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Then you will be spiritually strong. When you are spiritually strong, if you speak something on spiritual subject matter, then it will be effective. Otherwise it will be just like tape record playing. So this is required. And you should... You are asking something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And gradually, when you are well behaving, then you shall be initiated to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> That will give you strength, spiritual power. Strictly observe the regulative principles-no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. It is very simple. Read these literatures, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and observe these regulations. Then you will become gradually powerful. Your speeches will be effective. People will like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Now the program in the village, Swamijī, how to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Village... Just like you acquire some land. That you will get. It is not very... Is it difficult?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just we are doing so many places. So you produce your own food grains, not for making money but just for feeding yourself and the animals, cows. Keep cows, as many cows as possible, and produce, till the ground, field, and make water supply arrangement. If the investment is required, we shall do that. You have no worry about investment. We shall bring money from anywhere. But the work must be done very nicely. There must be good arrangement for water supply and for plowing and keeping the cows in order. Then you get sufficient milk, sufficient food grains and produce your own cloth. The girls and ladies, they can spine (spin) thread, and from the thread you make cloth, handlooms. So your first necessities of life, eating, and make little cottage, sleeping... And if you want sex, get yourself married, live peacefully. And when you are there you can defend yourself. So the first necessity is how to eat and how to cover. That you have to provide. That is not difficult. You can do it. And then you become peaceful, no anxiety for your maintenance. And then cultivate this spiritual knowledge the same way. Have a temple there. Have... Go on chanting, offering <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> You have got your food grains. Don't be dependent on anyone else. Become self-independent. And don't be after money. Simply produce your bare necessities of life. Keep yourself fit, strong. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, read book. Then you'll grow strong. Is there any difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, Swamijī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> To bring more people in our movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should be trained up, more people. Just like I went alone in Europe and America. So I have trained them. So it will depend on your training power, the more people will be attracted. If you advertise, "Come here," and if you have no power to attract them, then it will not be... You must be attractive to bring them. And that is spiritual attraction. You must behave yourself nicely. Then people will come. If you become purified, then naturally they will come. Just like if you prepare nice preparation with pure ghee, customers will be naturally attracted and they will pay and purchase. And if you prepare rubbish thing, one man may be cheated, but that will not be attraction for the general. Purity is required. That will attract. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> One must be pure. Then he will be able to attract. So if they see practically that "These people are very happy; they have no anxiety," then they will be attracted. Is it not? What is the difficulty? But if you want brothel and night dancing and wine and meat-eating, then it is spoiled. It becomes impure. To become pure is not at all difficult. Rather, to become impure, it is difficult. But people, with all difficulties, they are becoming impure. Otherwise the idea which I am giving, you can start anywhere, anywhere, any part of the world. It doesn't matter. Locally you produce your own food. You get your own cloth. Have sufficient milk, vegetables. Then what you want more? And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is Vedic civilization: plain living, high thinking. And poor thinking, poor in thought, poor in behavior, and living with motorcar and this, that, nonsense. It is all nonsense civilization. A first-class Rolls Royce car, and who is sitting there? A third-class negro. This is going on. You'll find these things in Europe and America. This is going on. A first-class car and a third-class negro. That's all. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Car is a necessity, Swamijī, don't you think so? Car is a necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessary. What is the use of car? If you locate yourself to get everything, your necessity, then where is the use of car? If you require car, you have a bullock cart. That's all. Why should you hanker after petrol, mobile (Mobil?) oil, machine, this, that, so many things. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, but don't you think that it would be impossible for you to come mostly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. So long it is not available, we must take the best advantage. That is another thing. But gradually we shall develop a society that all these unnecessary rubbish things should be rejected. That is the idea. Or those who are interested, let them manufacture car; we take advantage. We don't bother ourself how to manufacture car. <span class="Italic">Ajāgara-vṛtti. Ajāgara-vṛtti,</span> the idea is... <span class="Italic">Ajāgara</span> means the snake. So a mouse makes a hole in the field to live very peacefully. So, and he enters the hole, and a snake gets the information and he comes, enters the hole. He eats the snake... The snake eats the mouse and lives peacefully. So let this rascal manufacture motorcar. When we require, we take from them and ride away. We are not going to manufacture. There will be some rascals. Let them do that, mouse. We enter as snake. (laughter) That's all. We are doing that. We are doing that. I did not manufacture this house, but somebody, some mouse, has done. (laughter) And we have entered it, that's all. That's all. This is going on all over the world. You know George Harrison? He has earned money with so great hard labor, and he has given us a house in London, fifty-five <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth. Another boy, Alfred Ford, he's the great grandson of Mr. Henry Ford. He has given. He is giving still money. He is prepared with all his money. So those who are after money, material things, we have to induce them that "Spend for me," that's all, and let him earn. So far we are concerned, we shall live very simple life, simply in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa</span> does not go to construct big, big house. He simply constructs his character, and the other <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they offer him, "Please come here and sit down." Therefore the division is... One who is unable to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> let him become <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> If he cannot become <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> let him become a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> Otherwise let him remain a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But there should be ideal class. So we are trying to create an ideal society of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Then people will be benefited. And if everyone is śūdra, rascal, then what people will be benefited? They do not know how to live. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> will give idea, "Live like this. You will be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamijī, I propose one thing: To influence people more and more in the villages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the attraction, villagers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. We should go there and live with them for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have already suggested that you take land and be an ideal community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, if we don't get land, Swamijī. I would suggest if, for example, one week, four or three, Swamijī... (Hindi) What he wants to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Very good idea, very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That would be mercy to make the people conscious. And then again and again have here a same thing and then they would be influenced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good idea. It is very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The idea was in Hindi. It was in Hindi. We don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the village... I shall speak in Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In English so we can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am speaking in... So in the village, if these people go, they cannot do anything because they cannot speak in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, we should be there to organize. We will be there to organize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you organize, then that will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For example, I propose that Swamijī, sitting there, please tell me and I will tell the people they are the leader, to organize a <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in English, because Swamijī speaks English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can understand English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, there are many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, English edition we have got. French edition... You can speak in French and explain. He can speak in English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. We can stay in a village for about seven days or eight days, so that every night, for example, as we do it here, we can do it in a village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you can organize like that, then I will come personally. I will go and encourage you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I can organize it, Swamijī. There are many people who would like to see you, to talk to you, and to... Not especially to you but to all the swamijis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if you think so, then I can come back again. I'll come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, Swamijī. Do you want me to... I know there is one... Not only one, but if you want me to organize when you come and you would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. My point is: if necessary, I can also come. I can go into the village. There is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If you spent at least one month in these countries, Swamijī, I could...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Whenever you will say. If you say, I can stay just now one month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I can stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, I may organize something there. Then I bring you there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going to Johannesburg today. If you think that my presence will be beneficial, then after a week I can come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, Swamijī. Therefore I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is a very good program. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I shall tell them. There are many youngsters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So if you think my presence will be very beneficial, then after one week I shall come back. Our life is dedicated for this purpose. Whenever the... <span class="Italic">Ānukulyena kṛṣṇanuśilanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> Wherever there is opportunity, take advantage of it. That is our mission. Little light-fan it to make it fire. That is our mission. I welcome all these suggestions from you. Now you be serious and do it. If you like, I shall come back after a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. I have contacted two president of village. For example, Iskadye(?) There is a village known as Iskadye. Now there is Marshali.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have no distinction that "He is Hindu. He is Muslim. He is Christian." No. Everyone is welcome to take this culture, education. We have no such sectarian view. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Excuse me. Your idea is a program similar to what we've done or been doing previously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, Swamijī. Previously you have been only going one day in a village. Only one day means two hours or like this. People are influenced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Once or continual. Yes. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. A continual program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Knock, knock, knock, and the door will open." That philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They have been a little in the villages with books and doing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> in the street. That is very good. But it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Do <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> The villagers will join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But at the same time, if we collect all the people together and put it in place and talk to them every day, continually for seven days or eight days...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. It is possible. These are all practical proposals. There is nothing impossibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. Don't you think so, Swamijī? I have proposed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Paṇḍāls?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. We may build <span class="Italic">paṇḍāls</span> also. That will be... Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paṇḍāl</span> or no <span class="Italic">paṇḍāl.</span> You can sit on open place. There is no harm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We can build a <span class="Italic">paṇḍāl</span> in one day and put up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In villages we can sit down underneath a tree. That is <span class="Italic">paṇḍāl.</span> Why should you unnecessarily spend money? Just cleanse the ground and sit down. That's all. Makes everything simplified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If it's raining there, Swamijī. Rainy days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Rainy day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For that we need <span class="Italic">paṇḍāls.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So think. Kṛṣṇa is giving you intelligence. Think over, and Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I don't know whether it is practical, Swamijī. That is another suggestion. Like you are here for about seven days. Don't you think it would be good if you come here and you call people, youngsters, for example, those who are interested in the Vedic culture, would come here, in any place, for about seven days or eight days to stay with you and to learn what you want to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like a camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Like a camp, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You would prepare... At least every individual get one young man who will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes. Very good suggestion. Immediately accepted. Oh, yes. I speak only selected young men, and they will speak. Yes. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And it will be easier for us to go to their village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They would guide us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good suggestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> When do you think that you could do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I can immediately begin. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I can give you our address in Johannesburg, and you can write letter trying to organize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long it takes to go from here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's just a few hours. Johannesburg letter would only take two, three days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you keep the address and be in correspondence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Best if everything is set up beforehand, so when Prabhupāda comes it is already organized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. We can put it in newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one thing you must be assured, that if you can introduce this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, everyone will be happy. Be rest assured. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because if you go to the villages...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will be happy. Men and animal, everyone will be happy. Even the trees and plants, they will be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We could have big <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> parties in the villages here too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> How is it that the trees and plants will be happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they will hear Hare Kṛṣṇa. Not only trees and plants. The insects and everyone, they will have the opportunity of hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If we have got this act, Swamijī, here itself we can organize it. For example, we are getting holidays in November, school holidays, twenty-first November. So we can put it in the newspaper that "Those who are interested, young people from fifteen or twenty to thirty or forty, these people can send their letters and they would come. So we can answer them through newspaper, also radio, through TV, so that they would come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you do organize, then I shall stay. It is very good program. Let us give it some shape with your good cooperation. So Kṛṣṇa is giving you intelligence. He is giving so nice program. So do it practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And we can conquer out there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam. Śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana</span> is so powerful that it will conquer. It will be victorious. So I am very glad to meet you. And do this program. And if you like, I shall come back after a week and do. Utilize me in this way, I shall be very glad. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
