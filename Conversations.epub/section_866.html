<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...been a <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> leader in his previous lifetime, how could he take so naturally to Sanskrit and chanting like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He's just like a Bengali <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> leader. He joined the movement when he was only sixteen years old. Very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Jagannātha dāsa has just come back from Vṛndāvana. I think he's going to help on the books again. That will speed things up. Everything is going slowly through Sanskrit still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (looking at bones?) Chicken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, some animal, bigger animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ribs? Lamb, sheep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...kill. Simply kill. <span class="Italic">Paśu-ghna.</span> As soon as you become animal killer, Kṛṣṇa consciousness finished. Parīkṣit Mahārāja, <span class="Italic">vinā paśu-ghnāt.</span> Except the persons who are killers of animals, everyone will be interested.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One good thing is that there is generally a growing movement amongst American people, and I don't know about other countries, for vegetarianism. People are becoming more and more.... I think it is due to our books, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Book distribution, we are educating the people in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, we are educating; that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many vegetarian societies now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...they say, Santa Monica?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it is cleaner there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yesterday you suggested that I send groups of <span class="Italic">brahmacāriṇīs</span> to that farm in Oregon where Yamunā-mātājī is staying, but I was thinking that, actually, she is a very, very wonderful preacher, and if she can visit our temples more often, then she can.... In other words, it's more expensive and difficult to send so many people to her...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Otherwise, she can come to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's also a healthier environment, I think. It's a little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> She lives alone with Dīna-tāriṇī. She doesn't have much association. She's keeping herself apart a little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I think, that's one..., there's one disadvantage is that they have a little bit of a, their attitude is a little bit separatist from ISKCON in the sense of keeping aloof, and if the girls go there and live there, they may develop that same mentality. It might be better for her to come to the temples to teach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then make arrangement; I have not objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (laughs) She has objection. We can't force her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the problem. And if that's her feeling, then if you send people there they'll get the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Worshiping Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Oh, they're doing that beautifully, and they're expert cooks. They're very good devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They could just be so valuable to helping our temples if they agreed to preach to our devotees. They could train. [break] ...brought the reporters from <span class="Italic">Time</span> magazine over to see our temple. I had Mother Yamunā prepare some <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and she was also serving them, and then she was explaining about <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and preaching. So I could understand that as long as she stays on that farm, she's limiting herself, because she's an excellent preacher. She could be very valuable, expert preacher. In her.... Their idea is that they would like to make their farm a little bigger, with more women living with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I like that idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There will be no man to help give advice, just the women manage it all themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in Vṛndāvana there is <span class="Italic">bhajanāśrama,</span> they're only women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Śyāmabhajis?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">śyāmabhajis,</span> but <span class="Italic">bhajanāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that's a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With man is dangerous for both. I, I have given that: man is good, woman is good, when they come together-bad. Both of them bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bad. We see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that that farmland in Oregon is too small, very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them organize that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Jagadīśa was telling me that there are some boys who are donating seventy-five acres of farmland about four hours from Los Angeles. It is the best farmland in California. So he wants to develop this, because they have given it to him, specifically to make a farm and eventually to have the children of Gurukula live there. So perhaps we could invite Yamunā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you make Gurukula, government immediately stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stopped. That's the same (indistinct). The government can't raise objection. Better to keep it real small. Children are learning, then they are sent to India when they're eight or ten. The children here are doing very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The children here are doing as nicely as in Dallas, I've seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, small groups, small group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, and it forces all the temples to have a community, which is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Government rascals will come, "Do this, do that, do that," and they will never be satisfied, because their business is to tease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Simply to harass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harass. So that they may not extend this philosophy, no meat-eating, Then their business will be spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. We represent a threat to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore they do not like this program anywhere. No meat-eating, no drinking, no illicit sex. Then what remains? Everything is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually, we have many enemies in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When we printed that <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Consciousness is Authorized,</span> that little booklet, we gave the names of professors who appreciated our movement, and their school, their college. So there are some demons in America who.... Well, like we gave the name and address of the professor in that book. So some demons in America got a hold of that book, and wrote all the professors letters blaspheming our movement and Your Divine Grace and telling them that "Professor, you should withdraw your name. You are giving your support to a horrible movement." So we have many enemies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did the professors write back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Dr. Judah got a copy of one such letter, and he mailed it to Jayādvaita, so I've seen it. Very, very blasphemous, poisonous, but it was written by a very educated person. I could tell by the style of writing that the person who wrote that letter was very literate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not disclose his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, his name and address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That person gave his name and address, who wrote that letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we cannot bring it to the court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Perhaps. I'll see. But this is an example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is mostly from parents. Parents have had bad experience that they have lost their children to this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's the big propaganda now. The, there's one.... There's a number of men who kidnap, their professional business is to kidnap devotees and other people who belong to other groups like ours. And they're paid by the parents to kidnap the children back, and they call it deprogram the children, deprogramming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda saw that article on that Ted Patrick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I saw it in New York recently, our president, (sic:) Ādikeśa, he went up against Ted Patrick on television, big television show, and he completely defeated him. So Ted Patrick was saying that, you know, these people are all fanatics. So (sic:) Ādikeśa, at the end, he said, so, if we're fanatics, then the Pope is even more fanatical, so why don't you deprogram him? And everybody laughed at that Ted Patrick. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says we teach our.... I mean he has many arguments. He knows all about the incidents in Germany and Japan, and he uses this against us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's collected all these bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Lying and cheating," he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A few devotees who have joined him, who left and have joined him, they have given him this inside information, so he tries.... Actually, though, no strong devotee can be changed by him. He only gets the very new men. So now he's written a book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> About his experiences of kidnapping our students and others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the book called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's called <span class="Italic">Let My Children Go.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Let Our Children Go,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So we have got our lawyer to start a lawsuit against him, because in that book they are blaspheming us like anything. And this very big publisher, who published the book, has spent lots of money in advertising. And the advertising always uses our name, because it's controversial. They always try to get people to buy the book, saying "Now you can read about the dangerous Hare Kṛṣṇa people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughs) It's a good propaganda, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But we're trying to stop that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> America is feeling the strength of Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they're getting pinched. You have really come as an aggressor, Prabhupāda. (Prabhupāda laughs) Actually I think we are the most dangerous revolutionaries in the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To the <span class="Italic">rākṣasas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And everyone is <span class="Italic">rākṣasa</span> practically. If the government even understood your mission in coming here, they would never have granted you this permanent residence visa. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They thought "It is very nice, the Swamiji preaching about God." [break] So don't read newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Don't what, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't read newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, no. (laughter) Another smash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many don'ts, add one another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Don't read newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then next they'll make so much propaganda against you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we should do that. Whenever we preach to anyone and we tell them, I tell them that I have not gone to the movie house for ten years, they say "Oh, how horrible! Inhuman!" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> If we tell them not to read the newspapers, they'll think we're telling them to stop breathing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They..., don't read, you say "I am not reading any other literatures." Just like you say that "I have not gone to cinema house." It is another way of saying that "Don't go to cinema."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Christian missionary was trying to convert the people; so they would not listen. But then when he told that, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In hell there are no newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In hell there are no newspapers, they went, "Oh!" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Coal miners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, coal miners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No newspaper, it is horrible. Ask the health department of government, that "You write on the cigarette box: 'It is injurious.' " What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are preaching that; give us some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we're helping them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly, intoxication. And see practically, at least take some certificate from the health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> If they find out that the solution is with God, they would rather have the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from God, see practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...money from the taxes on these things. They don't want them to be abolished. The government make thousands and millions of dollars by taxing the cigarettes and liquor; so they don't want these things abolished. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dānavīr:</span> I'm in charge of the New <span class="Italic">Bhakta</span> program in Los Angeles, and yesterday one boy called up the temple, and he was seventeen years old, and he said, "Five years ago, when I was coming out of a store, I received this <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine. So I took it home, I was twelve years old, and I began reading it. I read six pages, but my mother, she was a strict Baptist, and she took it away, I couldn't read it. I never saw devotees again until this time." He called up. Yesterday he came and joined the temple and became your disciple. (Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just by reading one word of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Any word. (laughter) Surrender to Kṛṣṇa! [break] .... making almost ten devotees, new men, every month. And they're all coming from your books, from reading your books, every one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I am insisting, "Spread books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dānavīr:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there was one boy who just joined a few months ago, and he had been reading your books, and he came to join the temple. He had graduated from college and he's been to law school, and we found out after some time that his father, his name was Dr. Royal McClain, he was a very, very big preacher in the South, and he had his own television program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Christian. His father was the biggest Christian preacher in the South, he had his own TV show. Very big preacher, very strict Christian, and his son joined our movement. So the father calls up the son, "How could you desert our religion and join this Kṛṣṇa movement?" So.... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dānavīr:</span> He explained how he was actually feeling real love of God now for the first time in his life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He convinced his father that he should stay in our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Recently, in New York, my parents came to visit me. You know they.... Actually they didn't come to see me, they came to the restaurant, but I happened to be there. (Prabhupāda laughs) So, ah, they related a very unusual incident that one of their friends is a lawyer in New York. So they were having dinner with him the other day, and he mentioned that recently he had gone to Las Vegas for a vacation. In Las Vegas there are many gambling casinos. So when he was about to depart on the plane, one of his friends gave him a five dollar bill and told him that "In order that your gambling to be fortunate, the first good person you see there, you give this five dollar bill to him, and it will automatically bring you good luck." So the man went to Las Vegas, and when he got out at the airport, one of our devotees approached him, and this gentleman happens to be a lawyer who's fighting against us to keep us out of the New York airport, he's representing the airline company. So he didn't know it was one of our devotees because they were in the regular clothes, civilian clothes. So the devotee said, "Please, we're doing good work, educating people, you kindly give a donation." So the man thought: "Well, my friend gave me this," he gave him five dollars, and naturally, the devotee gave him a book. So the man didn't look at it, but he went into the taxi, the lawyer, and then when he looked he realized-(laughter) he was supporting the enemy. And another incident they related is that they go on vacation to South America. So there were in the Amazon, in the jungle, in the Amazon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh, I heard this when I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...and they, right in the middle of the jungle, suddenly the devotees were there. (laughter) Hṛdayānanda's men were there preaching, and they said they could not imagine that they were in this most unusual place, no one was around, but suddenly the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees were. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They told me they met Tamāla Kṛṣṇa's mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> If he gets a book in an unusual place, they always say, "You people are everywhere."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When we tell the public that we only have maybe ten thousand devotees, they are very surprised there are so few Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, because they see us everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore we're the most enthusiastic missionaries in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break]...say that all the ten thousand devotees, each of them is a moon, not a star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And you are the sun, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We are just reflecting your light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...do the work of many stars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. <span class="Italic">Ekaś candras tamo hanti.</span> Stars, they cannot do anything; they simply glitter, that's all. Glow-worms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, one boy joined our temple here, he was attending a very well known college and straight A's in physics, a scientist. So his parents were a little concerned. His father is a very big professor at California Institute of Technology, the biggest technical school in America. His mother is a professor of anthropology, and she is in the family of millionaires from Germany, German industrialists, so they were very concerned. So they came to visit their boy at our temple, and now the mother is coming regularly, giving nice donations and sometimes spending the weekend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dānavīr:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give him nice. He's living with us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was given one room? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dānavīr, was he given a room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dānavīr:</span> We have him a place to study every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> He also has a Ph.D., from Heidelberg University in philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, I say that take care of him, he's a good.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa:</span> Now that the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> has become so very good in quality, when the people finish reading it they see our ad for membership and they write in for information on membership and they are becoming our members, which means that each month they pledge donations, and they are on our mailing list. They receive newsletters, we even send them <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> in the mail. And now we've got 250 members each month donating to the Book Trust.... Altogether are donating four thousand dollars each month, and it is increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So increase the number of <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa:</span> Yes. As the quantity and quality increases in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> the membership program is increasing, and orders for the literature through <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> increases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's our best means of advertising, that magazine.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa:</span> Each day fifty letters are coming. Some are inquiries, some are orders. [break] ...program Prabhupāda, we continue writing letters to these people, until they become devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa:</span> And last year thirty became devotees. They wrote us letters saying that they have moved into a temple and that they are very happy now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa, he does all this writing; he's the secretary. He keeps correspondence with all of these people every month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In your book, there is an invitation in every book: "For more information, write to the secretary."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I've seen.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We've been planning for some time to prepare one flyer advertising our Vṛndāvana guesthouse, because every year college professors take students to India. They all go to see the Taj Mahal, so they pass through Mathurā, so they can easily stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Agra they must go. Every foreigner, they go to Agra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Agra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So we want to make some propaganda, and Air India will help us distribute it. So the question is, these students and professors, they cannot control their senses from smoking and so on. So do we want to allow them to stay in our guesthouse, because it is certain that they will smoke in their room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very difficult thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the only question, and then if you think it is all right that we still invite them, then we can prepare this flyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, first of all you GBC think, then and (act?) Make one room, smoking room, that's all right. Just like a, that kind of restriction is there in the airplane, smoking, not, non. So you keep a room separately, a smoking room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One time when I was staying in the Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma <span class="Italic">mandira,</span> I saw a man smoking a <span class="Italic">bidi</span> in his room.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was no life.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it was a good organization, that's all. On account of good organization, it was going on. But there was no life. The Marwaris, they can organize business very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> First-class, yes. Same thing with even someone like Swami Chinmoyananda's group. It is organized nicely, but there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no more organization also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was one girl that had some disease, she was unconscious for how long? A year and a half?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> She was, practically speaking, dead, but by artificial means, they kept the heart pumping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For one and a half years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And they thought that "If I pull out the electrical plug on this machine, then it will be murder." She was already dead, and the doctors fixed this machine to keep her heart.... Now they were afraid of pull out the plug.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not dead. Not dead. Dead cannot be continued by electricity. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Spirit soul was still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The soul was still there, but not in that condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So then there was no movement, no thinking, everything was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unconscious, that may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Terrible <span class="Italic">karma,</span> like a tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I remember reading in England there was somebody that had been in a coma for seventeen years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They had been in a coma, in a hospital, for seventeen years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventeen years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bad <span class="Italic">karma</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still he was taken care of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good patient. (laughter) And then after? He revived?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. He was still in a coma. It was just an article that he'd been in a coma for so long, and there was no hope that he would revive or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That description you give in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, at the time of death.... It's in the Fourth Canto. It's very, very graphic. During that Purañjana, the story of Purañjana, how the fire starts to build, an attack is given on the kingdom. Oh, boy, anyone who reads that will become very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sober.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...sobered up. These books are a real slap. They make you awake very quickly. We always.... I used to lecture from that to the new men to bring them out of their <span class="Italic">māyā</span> quickly. People don't like to think of death. They try to forget it. It's so fearful to them. And that brings all of the horrors of death very graphically in front of them. You describe how the soul is kept.... The body is burning like a big fire, and the soul is trying to get out, but all of the holes are blocked. Just like a man in a house that's burning and he can't get out. Fearful condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...numbers of men, big temples, it is all due to our books, to your books. So I was thinking that if one day this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement becomes so powerful that even it is giving instruction to governments, that will also be because of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very easy. If you increase the number of your devotees, government hears you(?). That is not very difficult thing. Simply you have to increase our supporters; then the government is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, although the actual number of initiated devotees is still few, there is a growing, ever-growing number of sympathizers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supporters, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tremendous number, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you make good supporter, then government is yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then it's all based on selling your books more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the principal way to increase our supporters and thus deliver the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When people ask me, "How many members do you have, how many people?" I don't answer any more "Five thousand," or something like that. Now I tell them many millions. Because the thing is when they ask, when you ask someone how many Christians are there in America, of such and such sect, they don't mean priests, they mean also the people who are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Congregation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Congregation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we should give that number, not as five thousand, but as so and so many millions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I say, when people ask me that how many followers you have got in India.... They're wholesale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The whole country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The whole country. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That man was amazed when on the plane when he asked me, he said, "How many members of your religion are there?" So I said, "Well, in India there are hundreds of millions." He couldn't imagine it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's what we should say, two million, like that. American, five hundred thousand. Why should we say five thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Before you were mentioning that we should start to try to get on friendly terms with some of these governmental people. Would that be done in the same way as they do in India? Just like we have so many government ministers that have become life members and things like that. Is that possible to do in America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are many government men. Why not? Human psychology is the same. How many lines in...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many lanes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Four lanes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is biggest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, there is a highway with six lanes, and there's even some with seven. Yes, fourteen lanes. In other words, fourteen lanes both sides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Every family has to have two or three cars; otherwise, they are not respected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also every family has to have two or three televisions; otherwise, there's fighting. Because the husband wants to see one show, the wife another, and the children another. So at least two or three televisions. Two or three cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India also, those who are rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Getting like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhogilal Patel had twenty-three cars. Just for him and his wife and father. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are spending money to save income tax. They have got enough income. So instead of giving to the income tax, they are thinking that "Why not provide some serfers(?), some drivers, some servants, and repair the house every year." In this way, spend money (laughing). It is good policy. Money's distributed to the poor instead of going to the government pocket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's got at least thirty-five servants, and it is only father and son and daughter-in-law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) That's all. No children even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Prabhupāda stayed there. They gave us much, er, attention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very favorable to us. Especially the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, Bhogilal. I remember when I first approached him for a donation, I asked him: "Please give twenty-five thousand rupees." I was the one who was approaching him. So then he said, "I can give ten thousand." So I said, all I did is I, just I said, "Please give more." He said, "All right, twenty-five thousand." (laughter) It didn't take very much preaching, he's so kind-hearted. And his son Pranlal was also nice boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's very intelligent, he knows what we are doing. His wife also, that young girl.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, very nice. They're actually a little aristocratic, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have palatial buildings in Ahmedabad, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, when I was staying there, that young girl, the daughter, she was always taking care, always taking care: "Swamiji, what do you want, what can I serve?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was a wonderful stay. That was when Mrs. Nair surrendered. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Bhogilal was coming daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To talk with you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And Pranlal was offering any help that he could. And they gave our, the secretaries were also treated very nicely, they gave us each a car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when I first came to this, to your movement, the first thing I was told is that Lord Caitanya's movement in this age will, like a moon, rise for ten thousand years. I was told that number, ten thousand years. Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And then after that, they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This movement will go for ten thousand years without any impediment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that means increasing, because it's the nature of the spiritual energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It increases; you should take this opportunity. You work sincerely; it will increase, it will increase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ten thousand years, there is a good opportunity to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many fallen souls will be delivered back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very encouraging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You once said that Christianity will die out. We will be the only religion left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not remember that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Someone told me like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christianity's already dead. We are purchasing the churches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And their priests are coming to join us as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See, this temple, this was closed. There was no men. And now balcony. In the same place, the same countrymen. That is the proof. This building. These boys and girls and men, they are not imported from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are formerly Christians and Jews.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These demons that are trying to challenge us, they cannot stop our movement for ten thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is their challenge? They have no, nothing to challenge. Unless they are violent. That much they can do, like demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That, you think that they will do that eventually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now people are civilized. It is.... But they want to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are thinking. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But on the garb of civilized person it looks odd. Especially in America when religious freedom is there. Otherwise they would have done. [break].... real peace formula, anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's rascal. This is very revolting. "Because I am not Kṛṣṇa con..., because I am a rascal?" "Yes." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, they don't like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) This is too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even you were challenging their gurus. That they get very angry at. Sataji will always tell me, "I like your Prabhupāda very much. But he is always criticizing all of our gurus."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Like Ramakrishna and this cheater magician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "He calls them cheaters, rascals, rogues, in public." At all the <span class="Italic">pāṇḍāls</span> you used to do that. Oh, they couldn't stand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That man that stopped me in the street...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can I say? Kṛṣṇa says. I am simply a child, repeating the words of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, you always tell them that. "It is not what I'm saying; Kṛṣṇa is saying." But that gets them even angrier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are Kṛṣṇa conscious. We are obligated to say like that.</div>
