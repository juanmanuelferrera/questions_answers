<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...no woman can... [break] So I took it very a cheap price. There was no question of woman. I kept my office there. And the address was Multani temple. It is a temple. Multani temple, Grant Road. And in my retired life my office was there, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple and Delhi, Chippiwada. And my residence was Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. And before that, that Keśī Ghāṭa. Who has seen that? You have...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was also temple. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Kṛṣṇa has arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Very nice side, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I lived in that house for seven years. And then I came to Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way? [break] ...stayed in that Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple, Malliks. And still I am living in temple. So Kṛṣṇa has arranged nicely, from the beginning of my life, temple. Which way? This way? [break] <span class="Italic">Medhi,</span> this is called <span class="Italic">medhi,</span> this rod, center. So the, the bull is bound up with it and he goes round, goes around. All day. So <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī</span> means center is home, and he goes round. Throughout the whole life. They are called <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> This is called <span class="Italic">medhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Medhi,</span> yes. Another <span class="Italic">medhi</span> means killing. So one who keeps himself in household life, he kills himself. Killing, <span class="Italic">Gṛhamedhī.</span> And that is little long term meaning. But this is the direct meaning. The <span class="Italic">medhi</span> rod is there, and he simply... He's very busy. Busy means within few feet. But he's thinking he's very busy. Anyone got, he has got home, and he's simply rounding about. Anywhere you go. The center is that. And what is that <span class="Italic">gṛha?</span> Where? Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhur gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate.</span> The <span class="Italic">gṛham,</span> house, is not actually <span class="Italic">gṛha. Gṛha</span> means the wife. <span class="Italic">Gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhuḥ. Gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate.</span> So to become householder means one must have a wife. So actually round the wife. <span class="Italic">Gṛhamedhī.</span> Round the wife. And what is wife means, everyone knows. It means round that thing. Is that good analysis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ucyate.</span> [break] ...explain. It is not my manufacture. What is said? <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi, yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi, yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi...</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...tuccham.</span> The <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī's</span> happiness, what is that happiness? <span class="Italic">Maithunādi.</span> Sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham. Gṛhamedhi-sukham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhīs",</span> what is their happiness? Sex. That's all. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham.</span> And what is that sex? <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span> It is itching between the two hands. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena kara.</span> But the, after that itching, there is very bad effect. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span> That is unhappiness. Therefore <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇāḥ,</span> they are not satisfied.
