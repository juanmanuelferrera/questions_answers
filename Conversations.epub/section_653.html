You attack and be killed." Even twenty years before, the king of Jaipur, every year he should go in the forest and kill one tiger personally. And the dead tiger will be brought in procession. He'd be given... Just like a prince or king dies-his body is taken in procession-tiger would be brought that way. Both of them, <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas...</span> So the tiger should be given the honor of a prince.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Because he was afraid. He was advised by Kissinger that "If you see him, then the Russian leaders, they will become angry upon you." So he refused to see him. So this received a great deal of criticism in America, that "We are for freedom and here he is coming, freedom fighter, and you refused to see him simply to pacify the Russian leaders." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...was a fault?</div>
