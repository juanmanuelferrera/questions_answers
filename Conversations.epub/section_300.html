<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally the gypsies are Egyptian, but are they Egyptian or English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, these are really tinkers. They're just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (talking in background:) In a sense. In a sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> They are, they are wanderers actually. But there are various kinds of gypsies. Now, you've got gypsies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, we have got gypsies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah, types of gypsies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Baul? Bauls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Bauls, or...? What are they called? Bauls? Bauls in Bengal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Baul, Baul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Baul is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> In this country... It's rather interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gypsies are all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Rajasthan, they come, many gypsies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Romeos, Romanic gypsies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nomadic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Romanic? No, Romanies. They're the ones that, they're... Well, they have nothing white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Nothing white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, nothing white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Everything's brightly colored...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> They will have white, but not pure white. They will have white, but there will be colors. Now they are real gypsies. Then you've got your show gypsies, show-business gypsies, you know, from the fairs, the World Circus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They're called carnies in the states, carnies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah. They won't mix. This other, of the top class, they won't mix with those, the showmen. Then you've got what we call Ditticoys(?), and what they term "men of the woods", crawlers, hedge crawlers, Ditticoy hedge crawlers. They are the lowest of the lowest, and they will not associate, nobody will associate with them at all. The ones around here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> The ones that have automobiles and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They're the Ditticoys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Right. They're our Ditticoys. But if you get any trouble with them, let me know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Well, two came around here once when we first moved in saying that Mrs. Ruffles had promised them that they could paint the place. And we thought it was a little suspicious the way they were talking. And we watched them. They were looking mostly at the lead, I think, in the glass. Finally, we told them to get off and not come back. But, a little suspicious of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Umm. Yeah. This, if you do get them, let me know. 'Cause I'll soon warn them off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (laughs) Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> I'll soon push them off. Unless, of course they want to come here as a visitor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They do steal sometimes, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Steal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh yeah, they will do, oh yeah. They will do. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their profession is stealing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Ah, but what'd you say then? Would you come and tell me they've stolen? You wouldn't, would you? Would you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Would you tell then, would you come up and tell me that they've stolen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Sure, if we saw them do it or something. Of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> You wouldn't charge them, though, would you? Or would you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If necessary, we would.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Well, that would be Kṛṣṇa's will, mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (English Man):</span> No, it depends, you know, if it's just some minor thing, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (talking over) ...maliciously try to take our property or something valuable, we have to defend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah. And how would you defend by? Yeah. (laughs) Yes, that's it, how would they defend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's where you come in. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> 'Cause that's right, you were the one who said that we could move in with a gun and shoot them, didn't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, I didn't say that. I'm the one who hit him with a big piece of wood. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh, you are? Well, they said they'd, "Why... Shoot them?" I said, "This is England, not America." (laughter) That was the cows, you know. Remember the cows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, in America, we're used to shooting rustlers, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah, but, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> String him off the nearest tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Lynchings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But what are you going to do about your security? Can I talk to this about this, you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> I'd like to get an idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In the temple room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> In the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, well, gradually we'll be having a lot of jewelry and things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes, I know this. This is what's worrying me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We have our ruby business here, as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes, this is another thing that worries me. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We have a nice safe down there, though, where they're all locked at night. Have you seen that safe, big huge safe, we built into the wall down stairs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Iron, iron safe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes, Iron safe. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Iron safe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh yes. Heavy, thick doors, like this, all surrounded with cement around. It's very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have kept two firearms in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because nowadays there are dacoits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Bandits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> This is in Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if we require, we can keep firearms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Hmm, hmm. Well, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Prabhupāda says; "If you require it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> (In background) ...necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We can keep firearms if we, you require it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> (everybody talking at once) It wouldn't be, no, it wouldn't be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...really need it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, no, no. Not if, unless it's absolutely necessary, but I doubt that... I would have to say that you want a firearm to kill vermin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We (laughs) are not interested in killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, Do you understand? Like rabbits or anything like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, what he's saying is that if we wanted to keep a firearm, it would have to go down in the book that it is for killing animals; that is legitimate business here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In order to get our license.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to get a license for using it for defending the property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Except that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> We could put an alarm system in if we put jewels in the Deity room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh yes, yes, put an alarm in, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> This is England, after all, a civilized country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Even in London, we haven't had need of..., haven't had much trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Well, no, but you see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America also, I have seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> ...there are some people who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in counties , they keep open door. I was in Butler.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (everyone talking at once) Yes, especially in places like Pennsylvania.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Motorcycle gangs, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah, well, you get some down here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...violence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah. You do get burglars, you know, people who'll break in, housebreaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh, you get housebreakers, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh, we get housebreakers. Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Out here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh yes, out here. Oh yes. And when they do go, when they do go in, they, it is quite a lot of stuff they take. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> There's nothing here for them to take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, no, I know... You keep it like that. But the point is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Except for the Deities. Around there, we'll have to have some alarm system perhaps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Uhh. Yes. And have this or a beam, a beam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Photoelectric...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah, photo... That's it, photoelectric. Now photoelectric cells. This is a very good thing because any movement and they are so timed that it won't operate with a fly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Only with a big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> A beam. So only with a human being. Which is quite of a good thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> This is a type of alarm system which shines a light across the openings in the house so that if any person passes across the light, it will break the circuit and an alarm will go off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Ah, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So it's a very simple, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That would have to be just in the Deities' room. 'Cause otherwise, we'd be tripping it all night long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh, no, these are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Open the windows at three in the morning like we did last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> We'd get in trouble all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But that's the only thing... But if there's anything else that you, if you got...? I think, as I say, given time, a bit of experience. But I do feel that a lot of little things which you do in the temple, and I appreciate this, but I think that they, to try 'em outside until people accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But, at the same time, I don't believe that you're going to change all your principles, are you, just to suit people outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> When we go outside, we can act accordingly. There's no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, you do, don't you? There's only these little things, you know. To me, I mean, you come past me, my house, and if I'm out there, it makes no difference to me at all. And I don't suppose it makes any difference to a certain other people, but there's just that little bit of nuclear that, you know, will sort of catch on to it, as a, as a means to their own ends or to justify their rumors, I suppose. This is what I think. Well, anyway, we can sort out that as we go along.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Time heals all wounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Ah yes, time... yeah. I dare say, I mean, possibly about next year, there may be something, someone else may have bought another house. So, so there'd be rumors about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America, we are recognized by the police: We are well-behaved, peaceful persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In America, we are recognized by the police as peaceful persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> That's right. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Every Sunday, we want to have the neighbors come if they will. We will have every Sunday a feast here for everyone in the village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Many people will come from the public on Sunday, but in particular, the neighbors are going to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Well, Father Bernard... We had this... You had a meeting, hadn't you? With the Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> This, now this trust, the Village Trust, the Village Trust, right? This is a good idea. Because you got a couple of dissenters are on the board there. You see. And so when they got the chairman, it's discussed properly, they will spread out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> They will all say, "What you've said is a load of old hooey." You see. And this will be that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> The policy will be decided by them, more or less, won't it? Like how everyone should regard us, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Well, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What he's saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, no, no. You're getting the wrong idea. You're getting the wrong idea. No, you're getting the wrong idea. No you're getting, you're gonna get the wrong idea. First of all, you've got your principles, you've got your independence. Same as I've got mine. Right? It is your place. This is your home. If I don't like the way you live, that's... I don't have to... I can either shut my eyes to it, but I don't have to turn away from you. Same as you may not like the way I live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> So you'll have to accept my misgivings as or I'll have to accept your misgivings. But I'm not going to create a good impression... I'm not going to think, "Well, I mustn't do that because I'm going to upset Mrs. Smith. I'm mustn't do that because I'm going to upset Mr. Jones. And if I do that, I shall upset somebody else." I mean, if you're going to do that, then life is going to be a misery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But the point is this, that if you just act as you are, and, if you don't mind me saying... These little things which come back to me, and thinking a bit logically, from a common sense point of view, I don't think it's necessary. But you can tell me to mind my own business. I'm not here to dictate to you. Now you must remember this. And the only time I should dictate to you is if you commit any offense outside the road where my jurisdiction starts, or there is a serious incident in the temple which I would have to come out and sort out. Now can you follow me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Actually, we would appreciate if you would tell us these things, that the village people are thinking this, thinking that. If they're feeling unhappy about something, if it's something that we can change, let us know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Well, this is it. Look... But you can't do this... Rome wasn't built in a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you cannot satisfy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> You cannot satisfy everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, but about our external behavior...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not. We cannot change our policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No. About our external behavior, things that they are finding bothersome... Like we are chanting loudly on the street or in the doctor's office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> These kind of things, we want to know. See.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Do you agree with that, Prabhupāda? Isn't it? Prabhupāda, Prabhupāda? Do you agree with that, though, that it was not necessary to, say chant continually out in a doctor's surgery or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No. I don't think so. I mean I wouldn't go around in the road holding up my book which tells me about the law. You know what I mean. I would read my law inside my office if I'm not certain of it. Okay. These are the thing... But there again, if you want to, well, you do it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No. What he means is that if, whenever he hears of some incident, like the doctor's surgery, should he tell us or not? And I'm saying he should tell us so we'll know. And if it's nothing important, we can correct it easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we should generally know that we may take pleasure chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa loudly. Others may not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is generally. So when you go others' place, we may not chant loudly, simply chant in such a way you can hear. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah, this'll do it. I mean, if you want to chant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't stop chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that: (softly:) Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma... I am hearing. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not that you have to advertise yourself, you are chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Because, you see, this is the thing. People say, "Oh, you know..." Because you know that they call me. You know what they say, don't you? Hare Kṛṣṇa on this side, and Harry Edwards on the other side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh, Harry on this side and Hare Kṛṣṇa on the other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa on this side, and Harry Edwards on the other side, that's me. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He lives across the road, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> I live across the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So it's Hare Kṛṣṇa on this side and Harry Edwards on that side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> His name is Harry Edwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> My name is Harry Edwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So the people who are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A good name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By chanting your name... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Oh, there you are, there you are, yes. This is it. They are chanting my name, you know. Yeah. 'Cause when I ring up the station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when somebody's disturbed, he can say, "I'm calling Mr. Harry."(laughter).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> You see, when I ring up the station in the morning, you see, say, "Ah, Hare Kṛṣṇa." I say: "Hare Kṛṣṇa to you." (laughter) So I mean some way or other, you're doing what you're asking to do, aren't you? Psychologically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Everyone's being forced to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yeah... But I think these, you know, and I know, of course, you know, I've...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people chant Hare Kṛṣṇa by seeing us. Yes. All over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes. They say to me, Harry Edwards, you see, or Hare...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> So therefore, really and truly, if you look at it psychologically, you've achieved your object without them knowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, this is why we dress this way. Every time we go on the street, everybody on the street says, "There's one of the Hare Kṛṣṇa people." He says "Hare Kṛṣṇa" one time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> That's. Really. Yeah, yeah. But do you think...? I suppose... Well, it's like everything else. I suppose they would get used to it. Oh, I don't know. They say, if there's a problem... As far as we are concerned, as far as the police are concerned, we can find nothing wrong. You have done nothing wrong, nothing wrong. I mean, I don't know what you got, supposed to do, I don't know what you're supposed to do wrong anyway, but... But that's it, as far as we are concerned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> We do have this liaison. You know, I must keep in liaison with you. So if I come over here, gentlemen, you must realize I am not here, I am not here for the purpose of, say, spying, if you may think this. I don't suppose you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You're welcome at any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But this is the purpose, anyway... I don't know if I've got to, stay overstayed my welcome...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We feel very good when we see you here. We feel very pleased to see you on the grounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes, oh, yes, yes. But don't forget, gentlemen, as I say, I, you must realize that I still have a job to do and if there was something in which you think I should report upon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mr. Ha... (opening letter), you can read this letter, that so many people, they offered their place for our temple. Just now we have received this letter. One body is offering his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. I brought that letter from London. It's from Guyana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He wants to write you into his will or something, give some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, also, there is that Bengali gentleman, he was offering two lands, one Agartala, and Agra. The people are still willing to cooperate with religious movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah, this place is also donated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> George is going to Portugal next month for reading and chanting. He's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Portugal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Portugal is a country in Europe near Spain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Outside of Spain, Portugal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Portugal, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's quiet and sunny there. So he wants to go and chant and read. He's beginning to read <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> now. He said, "I've had it here so many years. I even wrote the foreword, but I've never read it. So now I began to read it." And he reads every day. He's into the Fourth Chapter now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, and he says he's completely amazed by it, how wonderful it is, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Very nice, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Athens, we stopped for forty-five minutes. The... I was going to Nairobi. So some young men by seeing us began to chant, "Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everywhere we go, as soon as people see us, they say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." In Montreal, when I was going on road, the children will chant, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." So it is now popular. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Just last summer we were walking in... Was it St. James' park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Around that pond. And one old bum was there on the park bench. He went by and stood up: "Hare Kṛṣṇa." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Yes, yes, well, you know. I think in some ways that you, to a certain extent, you must stuck to, in a common sense way, and also probably to the..., slightly to the Western ideas. You know? But these things, I have a lot of things... I think that the festival week has done a lot of good. There has been a lot of bad feeling, though they didn't know anything about it on Tuesday, did they? You had nearly a thousand people here on Tuesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Nearly a thousand people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But they didn't take any notice of that. On the Wednesday, was your birthday. You had the youth, or young, selected...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, that was on Friday, the young people's day was on Friday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No, no, no. On Wednesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> On Wednesday...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> There were young people here, but that was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> A special invitation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, a special invitation party, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> That's right, yes. I think that's when it was because the, the, the sound or the echo was going that way. But I didn't hear anything. And Inspector Turner, my instructor, came up. You saw me with an instructor who was in uniform like this, not in uniform, and we were quite satisfied. But, as I say, you can please some people, and others, you can never please. So with those people, I say, you'll just have to get on with it. That's all there is to it. Well, I think, I declare, I've taken up His Divine Grace's time enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...you are welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Well, that's all right, as long as you say so. But I have got to go soon. I've got some writing to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> But if there's anything that you feel that you want to ask me or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly, when we are in difficulty, we must take shelter of you. What can we...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harry:</span> Beg your pardon...? (end)</div>
