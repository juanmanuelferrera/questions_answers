<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...every day to get permission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He is coming at one o'clock, so we'll give the whole <span class="Italic">mahā-prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at four o'clock you are coming there? No. At Mr. Raja's house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> ...minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are holding some meeting? Today we have got very good article in the <span class="Italic">Sunday Chronicle.</span> Everyone is reporting about us very nice, and still there are some envious persons, they are creating doubts about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> They cannot create any doubts, Swamiji, as long as you are establishing the equality of man in the eyes of God, only one God. That is being done, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we have no discrimination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> No discrimination. And that is the... I don't think anybody called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Unless one is <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu</span> he cannot reach the platform of devotional...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> And how can there be anything greater service to humanity than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is the first thing, that <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ, Brahman</span> realization. Then <span class="Italic">prasannātmā.</span> He is no more under the material tribulation or anxiety. We are in anxiety on account of our material conception of life. Prahlāda Mahārāja said <span class="Italic">sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because we have accepted this <span class="Italic">asat</span> body, material body, which will not exist, and we are concentrating our attention only on this body, therefore we are always anxious. <span class="Italic">Asad-grahāt. Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt.</span> On account of <span class="Italic">asat.</span> So this is going on all over the world. Simply anxiety. They have created United Nations, but where is the United Nation? The people go there with anxiety, that's all. And come back again with anxiety. Because their <span class="Italic">asad-grahāt</span> remains. The Indian is thinking, "I am Indian, this body." And the American is thinking, "I am American," and the Pakistani is thinking, "I am Pakistani." So <span class="Italic">asad-graha</span> is there. So how the anxiety will go away? But they do not know this. There is no education. They want to keep him... "Feel always that you are Indian," "Feel always that you are American." "You feel always you are Hindu," "Feel always you are Muslim." <span class="Italic">Asad-graha.</span> How there can be no anxiety? <span class="Italic">Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt.</span> So <span class="Italic">asato mā sad gamaya.</span> This is Vedic injunction. Don't remain on the <span class="Italic">asat</span> platform. Come to the <span class="Italic">sat</span> platform. <span class="Italic">Asato mā sad gamaya. Tamaso mā jyotir gamaya.</span> Don't remain ignorant. But unfortunately people are so absorbed in <span class="Italic">asat</span> things they do not know what is <span class="Italic">sat.</span> They cannot go to the <span class="Italic">sat</span> platform. They cannot go to the light platform. And they are struggling like that. No solution. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> The government may change, but the men are the same, in darkness. What improvement will there be simply by changing government? The persons who are governing, they are in the darkness. So how, by change of government, there will be change of situation? I said in, where? That the United Nations is an assembly of dogs barking. Where did I say it? It was published in the paper. I said that if you keep them as dogs, and if you ask some dogs, "My dear dogs, please do not bark. Live peacefully," is it possible? The dog will bark. That is their business. So we are not enlightening them what is actually we are. We are keeping on this bodily conception. That is the dog's conception. And how there will be peace? There cannot be. Simply by agreement, by treaty, there can be any peaceful? No. Just like children. They agree, "Yes, we shall not fight." Next moment they'll fight. And again they will make agreement. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> What could we do, the devotees staying(?) here in Andhra Pradesh state?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You become guided by <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> (Hindi) If you think that everything could run then <span class="Italic">ahobalam(?)</span> is there. They are now (indistinct). But if you are going. Tomorrow they have to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have counted? Not yet. Counting? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I've got it listed. 182. 1-8-2. All their temples should be reorganized on the... People should come there for being educated. Temple means it is an educational center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Educational center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇas</span> means they are teachers. <span class="Italic">Paṭhana-pāṭhana-yajana-yājana-dāna-pratigrahaḥ.</span> So every temple should be educational center, and the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> should be engaged. They should be properly educated and they should teach others also. In this way, temple means education in spiritual life. And actually spiritual life is life. This material life, the bodily conception of life, is dead life. <span class="Italic">Aprāṇasyeva dehasya maṇḍanaṁ loka-rañjanam. Th</span>is nice shirt you have changed because there is life. When there is no life, who is going to change dress? The body is there, but why you are not interested in changing the dress? Better interest... The sooner the body is thrown away or burned, better. So similarly... [break] There is a proverb that a vulture goes very high, but his ambition is where is a dead body. As soon as he finds a dead body, (growling sound) immediately. And we see, "Oh, how high he has gone." So what is the going up so high if your aim is to find out a dead body? And actually, these aeronautics, they went to very high, suppose they went to moon. But after going there they find, "Where is Moscow? Where is this?" The same vulture business. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the only hope to give relief to the human society. So everyone should cooperate with this movement. Unfortunately, there are so many envious persons, they are writing against us, talking against us. They should be envious. Because they want to exploit, keeping the people in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Verse">sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mantrauṣadhi-vaśaḥ sarpaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>khalaḥ kena nivāryate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So our preaching is very difficult task, still we're trying our best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> That's what I find, Swamiji. My work is also very difficult. Work is very difficult. We have about 30,000 temples in this state, properties that have temples, the (indistinct) of temples, interest in temples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it can be... If government takes our advice, we can give them advice how to organize, how to utilize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Definitely. We want a scheme. Definitely. Fortunately, it is the land of this Kṛṣṇā and Godāvarī. It is a sacred land. Tuṅgabhadrā, Kṛṣṇā, Godāvarī. We are finding everywhere there has been some kind of ups and downs. It has been studied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the government's duty to settle up. But they must know how to settle up. If they do not know then they cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> No, we want guidance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That guidance we can give you. That guidance we can give. Because we have taken the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> position. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> duty is to give guidance to the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Government means <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So if the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> take guidance from the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and they try to execute, then everything will be all right. So we can give you sufficient guidance provided you accept it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> The end is common. And we have found yesterday some of your <span class="Italic">śiṣyas</span> had come. They're so happy. They said, "This is what the requirement is," and we accept him as a <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple means a center, educational center, education. Give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Bring. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> And we have centers through Tirupati all over the country in our important centers, we have got some centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the thing is that, say, for Tirupati, it has got biggest income. But I understand that this income is being engaged for industrial purpose. But that, how to utilize in industrial purpose, that you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> But just one thing, let me explain Swamiji. We are not directly giving to industry. What we are doing is we are depositing in a fixed deposit in certain banks, getting the highest interest. That interest we are utilizing for Sanskrit studies, Vedic studies, etc. We are not directly giving. What we are doing is this: we invest in your bank, but bank shall invest in a productive industrial purpose. We put a condition. We are not directly putting in the industry, and that's a wrong propaganda that's being done. What we are doing is the interest that comes, the funds that are there, they are safely there in a bank. The interest that comes we utilize only for religious purposes, like, as I said, the <span class="Italic">dharma-pracāra, veda-pracāra,</span> all that we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, I have taken this <span class="Italic">veda-pracāra.</span> Why not come and join with us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Yes, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All over the world they're accepting. Now these foreigners, they're accepting. I have done it single-handed. So if the government comes forward and join with me, we can do at least ten times work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> How, kindly give us sir... I don't know if I'm taking your very valuable time. We are very sincere about it. We are having Himalayan opposition for some of our schemes. But when I studied yesterday, because before I came to you I thought I shouldn't just come for wasting your valuable time. Therefore I have found that your aims are what we have been thinking of for the society. The <span class="Italic">veda-pracāra,</span> we were thinking that we have also started on a small scale, not on your scale. And if it is that we were thinking in these terms-translation of these <span class="Italic">Vedas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, first of all, you must know what is <span class="Italic">Veda. Vedas, vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Vedic knowledge means to understand Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself, to understand Him. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. So if you accept the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the whole <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are accepted. Because purpose of <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is to understand Kṛṣṇa. And that Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself-"I'm like this." So where is the difficulty to understand <span class="Italic">Vedas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> May I explain to you what we have, we are doing, Swamiji? In the religious we have now taken statistics of our <span class="Italic">veda-paṇḍitas.</span> There are three hundred of them. Now they have said they don't want to come out of their villages. We have said wherever they are, in their own village, for one or two hours, they meet, chant the <span class="Italic">Veda</span> in the temple or the village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> They are now willing to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There may be some percentage. If you do not accept the recognized process... Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He was a great scholar. So He was chanting and dancing. So some of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs, </span>Māyāvādī<span class="Italic"> sannyāsīs</span> in Benares... (to servant:) You keep it there, they will take. There was a meeting, and the question was that "You are a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī...</span>" This question was put to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "You have taken <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> you do not read Vedānta, and you are mixing with the sentimental persons, chanting and dancing. What is this?" This was the question. So He explained that, "Yes, My Guru Mahārāja found Me a great rascal." <span class="Italic">Guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc.</i> <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 7.71]<span class="Italic">.</span> You understand Bengali? No. "My Guru Mahārāja saw Me a rascal number one. Therefore he has chastised Me." What is that? <span class="Italic">Guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsana.</span> "He has said that 'You are rascal, you cannot read <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and Vedānta. You are rascal. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.' So I'm doing that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Chanting, yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He's Kṛṣṇa Himself. He's neither rascal nor fool. But He represented the rascal and fools that who will read Vedānta. Everyone is after this <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> No student will come to study Vedānta. That is not possible in this age. You see? Maybe somebody interested, but generally they'll not come. Even if one is born in the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, he is no more interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> May I submit, Swamiji, therefore what we did was, these three hundred people, if they chant, three hundred rupees for a <span class="Italic">dāna-paṭha,(?)</span> and two hundred rupees for him and a hundred rupees a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> why he will take money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> It is, no, we are giving it as <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā.</span> But they are chanting in exchange of <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā.</span> Because you are giving <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā,</span> therefore they are chanting. And you stop that <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā,</span> nobody will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> True. You are correct. (laughs) That we have told them. If they teach their own children, hundred rupees for him for teaching, forty rupees for a child who learns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they will do, but when the hundred rupees will not be sufficient, they'll give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> One thing is that at least one child is learning in each and every...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say that is not the process. If you want to satisfy with money, and in exchange of money he wants to chant <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> that is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> No, Swamiji, some of them didn't care either for the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> And they were starving, and they were starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But generally, generally, that Caitanya Mahāprabhu's process should be taken. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu represented Himself that "I am fool." He is not fool. He's representing the fools of this age. So if we take that process, it will be successful. It will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> That also, (indistinct) that <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> and every.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let them come. Let them come in the temple and there may be sumptuously offering of <span class="Italic">bhoga.</span> Let them chant and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> In this chanting illiterate, literate, rascal, fool, lower, higher, everyone can join. And give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> See the effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Yes. That is also part of the, that is the other part of it. We are having <span class="Italic">dhana-prasthānam,(?)</span> <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> group, <span class="Italic">hari-kathā</span> group...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are meant for the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> So there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> practically. Neither there is training of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas. Brāhmaṇa</span> means he must speak truth. <span class="Italic">Satyā śama dama titik-</span>and if you ask nowadays anybody that "You don't speak lie, you speak truth," he will laugh, that "What a rascal this is. By speaking truth one can live nowadays?" he will say. The first business is <span class="Italic">satyam.</span> And if you ask him, "You speak truth," he will laugh. So where is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is so simple that if you ask him about his secrecy, he'll tell you, "Yes, this is..." <span class="Italic">Satyam.</span> Just like Jābāli? <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad,</span> he was asked, he went to Gautama Muni. Satyaka, yes, for initiation. Gautama Muni asked him, "Who is your father?" He said, "I do not know." "Go to your mother." He went to the mother. Mother said, "Oh, my dear son, I do not know." He was a prostitute's son. So he came to Gautama Muni and said, "Sir, my mother does not know, I do not know." So he said, "You are a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Because you don't keep any secrecy you are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> I'll initiate." So it is not the birth, but the quality-truthful. But these qualities will come when you make him a devotee. So this process should be taken, how to make him a devotee. And the easiest process of making devotee is let them come to the temple, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Then gradually they'll become... I began this movement on this. Very simple. And they have come. I never asked them to study <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in the beginning. What they'll read <span class="Italic">Veda?</span> What do they know? But this process has become successful. So if you take this process it will be very quickly successful. And then literature. I never gave them literature. I have got about eighty books. Not that in the beginning I asked them, "Come here and read books." No. "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>" Now they are interested in reading books, in publishing them, in selling them and everything. They are doing everything. So if you take the authorized program it will be successful. Otherwise, it will not be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Well... And how long the Swamiji will be here? I'll take up the program. We will. As a matter of fact, somehow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am always at your service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Somehow, the coincides, our program, we have taken a small scale. Every temple has been asked to have this <span class="Italic">bhajana,</span> <span class="Italic">hari-kathā,</span> then this <span class="Italic">pūjā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be some competent man to induce. Everything will be planned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Therefore our training has to be started perhaps here. Some of those people who could go. These are all the ideas of course. If you could give an impetus, that's exactly what I wanted to... Take advice from you. Now if a center is established. What we lack very badly are those people who can competently take up this work in the whole state. The temples are there, the funds are there, organization is there. Men who are, as you say, the real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who could go and preach this, we are lacking. We are lacking. And he has to be trained. And the right training you are giving. Anywhere I see your men are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can give men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Yes. And a training institute has to be started. Very badly we need it. My department also. Having any number of people. It is suffering because we don't have the proper people with that objective to govern...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the culture is lost. Culture is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Because we take the local people as trust board members. We appoint officers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I said if you keep them dogs, what is the use of United Nations? You cannot make the dogs united. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Yes. Therefore recently in Tirupati we have been thinking of starting a training institute along with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, they have no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> They have no idea. Ramakrishna Mission we asked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> They don't have people. They said, "We don't have men even for our own missions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. How long they can go on with false pretense? And these people, they have no idea what is spiritual life. It is a profession for collecting money. So if you... We do not like to criticize. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Kanayalal Munshi, he did not believe there is life after death or he did not believe there is Kṛṣṇa, fact. This is the founder. So what is their knowledge? And Vivekananda made <span class="Italic">Nārāyaṇa daridra.</span> So this is their manufacturing ideas. They have no sound knowledge, vacant. They are misled themselves, and they will mislead others. This is going on. But if you say that, "You are the only man?" I can say, "Yes, I am the only man" at the present moment. You believe or not believe. And why? Because I am following Kṛṣṇa's instructions. That's all. I do not touch anything. That is our process. What Kṛṣṇa has said, we say, that's all. Therefore there is little success. I don't manufacture. I have no extraordinary power or I cannot show magic or jugglery of words. But I do sincerely to present what Kṛṣṇa has said. So if you do that, you'll be successful. If you do not do that, you'll never be successful. If you manufacture idea... We must know that we are defective. Our manufacturing of idea all defective. We must take standard instructions from Kṛṣṇa. Then everything... So if you stick to this point, then we can guide you. And you'll be successful. Guidance is Kṛṣṇa. Our duty is to present Kṛṣṇa. Just like somebody has sent you money order, 1,000 rupees. I am a peon. I am not giving you the money. The money is sent by somebody. But I do not open it, adulterate it-that is my honesty. That is my honesty. So the instruction is Kṛṣṇa's. If I honestly deliver the same message to you then you are benefited, I am benefited. And as soon as I pilfer it, then it is useless. I am useless and you don't get profits, success. So if you decide to take Kṛṣṇa's instruction rightly, then we can give you very good guidance. Everywhere you'll be successful. Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Any plans to have training and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything. It must be sanctioned by the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then it will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> For success the people, the local language, so that they may...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Language difficulty is there. That we have to solve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Therefore training has to be done here and in other places, and a center has to be there. You could plan one of those with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, plan is there. Just like we are doing. And we can give you in detail. Provided you accept this principle that we shall abide by the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Who questions the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult. Very difficult. You see. Big, big scholars, big, big politicians, they are supposed to be preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. They take their photograph in front of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but without Kṛṣṇa. They'll never talk of Kṛṣṇa any time. Banish Kṛṣṇa. Even Gandhi has said, "My imagination of Kṛṣṇa is different." Perhaps you have read in his <span class="Italic">Gītā-Press</span> edition.(?) Kṛṣṇa is speaking... Radhakrishnan said when Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ,</span> he says "It is not to the Kṛṣṇa person." Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad bhaktaḥ,</span> and he says it is not to the Kṛṣṇa person. Just see how misleading it is. And if a person like Dr. Radhakrishnan, Gandhi, misleads, then who will hear me? What I am? There is one big person in Bombay, he said that he has set aside ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees for <span class="Italic">Gītā-pracāra.</span> But when I proposed <span class="Italic">Gītā-pracāra</span> means Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">pracāra,</span> so he said, "No, I want <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> without Kṛṣṇa." Everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Commissioner:</span> Then who is the <span class="Italic">Gītā-pracāra? Gītā-pracāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are doing that. You can see from this big, big person. Gandhi used to say that he believes in <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> gives him solace in difficult times and so on, so on. But has he ever preached about Kṛṣṇa? Tilok has ever preached about Kṛṣṇa? Radhakrishnan has ever preached Kṛṣṇa? Nobody. Their policy is take Sītā and kill Rāma. Rāvaṇa's policy. Take away Sītā. Take away <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and kill Kṛṣṇa. So Rāvaṇa's policy will never be successful. Rāvaṇa's policy means he will be destroyed. You cannot do any harm to Rāma, but he will be destroyed. This policy, that take Sītā and kill Rāma, means he will destroy himself. So this is going on. Take <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and kill Kṛṣṇa. This will destroy the whole thing. This Rāvaṇa's policy. And Hanumān's policy is somehow or other rescue Sītā and get her seated by the side of Rāma. Therefore he's worshiped, <span class="Italic">Vajrāṅgajī.</span> That is the difference between Rāvaṇa's policy. Sītā is the via media. But one is trying to bring back Sītā and seat her by the side of Rāma, and another is trying to take away Sītā and kill Rāma. This wrong policy will not take. We have to accept the instruction of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord. Then everything will be all right. <span class="Italic">Prasāda?</span> So thank you very much for your coming. So, kindly if you will agree to take the instruction of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> I am always at your service. I'll give you such guidance, our men, our everything. But you have to decide this. You cannot take up this policy, take <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and banish Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted.(?) (end)</div>
