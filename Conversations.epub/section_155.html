<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For young man, the more he sleeps, he is dead. He's a dead body. A child, if he overeats, if he overeats, then it is not bad for him. So anyone overeats, it is bad, specially for old man. And if child gets diarrhea, it is good for him. When a old man gets diarrhea, it is death for him. Child gets diarrhea means whatever poisons he has acquired he gets out. His health becomes renovated. And old man, if he gets diarrhea, he loses his vitality. <span class="Italic">Chele hange bastre guru hage mostre.</span>(?) These are the para... What is called? Common sayings? Parables? Oh, it is the time. They are not yet ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No. If we get that house, Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We can get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? You have appealed to the king, and he is willing. Why can you not? What is the difficulty? Now it is your business how to induce, induce him. There is chance, ninety percent chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In which way will it be most helpful, in giving money personally or inducing others to give money? He will give money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> How much money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten lakhs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Ten lakhs. They can give the full amount?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? This man... It is to be very carefully tackled. This king is going to die very soon. And as soon as the king dies, the queen's position is very precarious, almost finished. So if she becomes our president, she'll continue to keep her honor and prestige. That's a fact. She's a good lady. We have no objection to make her the president of the local center. And she is American. She will be able to tackle these American boys and girls with motherly affection. And we shall keep her always in good respect so that throughout her life she shall be honored all over as she was, as she was honored with her husband. This is a fact. So you have to convince her. And I think if the other ladies who are..., her daughter-in-law and granddaughters, like that... Because her son is dead. He was the king. This old man being invalid, his son was king. And I think that middle-aged woman was there. You have marked this? She might be her daughter-in-law and the young girls might be grandchildren. One of them, one of the daughters, girl, was very beautiful. So it appears that she comes from the royal family. <span class="Italic">Rāja-kanyā</span> King's daughters are very beautiful. That is fabulous in India, king's daughter, <span class="Italic">rāja-kanyā.</span> In India if anybody gets a good dowry and a beautiful wife it is said, <span class="Italic">arddhe rajatva eka rāja-kanyā</span>(?) Actually we have seen in..., when Devaki was married to Vasudeva, how much dowry. Can anyone imagine now? So many thousands of horses, chariots, elephants, maidservants, all decorated with gold ornaments. One cannot imagine even at the present moment. Therefore they talk of "legends." But actually such dowries were given when a king's daughter was married. Not only royal family, even in ordinary family still, those who are rich, they spend lots of money to be married, either son's marriage or daughter's. When one spends lots of money during the marriage of one's daughter and son he is considered to be really rich man. That is the proof that he is rich man. So we can begin. He cannot rise, this, what is called, Muktananada? That's all right. Where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Muktananda, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You come here. Girls may sit here. You can sit comfortably on this. (Devotees come in and sit down.) What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kauśalyā:</span> Her baby. Her child. Her son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So we were talking of Ajamila, a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> resident of Kānyakubja, presently known as Kanauj. So, <span class="Italic">kānyakubje dvijaḥ kaścid asit patir..., asit kaścid dāsī-patir ajāmilaḥ, nāmnā naṣṭa-sadācāro dāsyaḥ saṁsarga-dūṣitaḥ.</span> That, what is known as, at the present, prostitute, they were know as <span class="Italic">dāsya, dāsī.</span> (aside:) Don't make sound, "cut, cut." Silent. <span class="Italic">Dāsī...</span> The <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> kings also, when they married, with dowry many maidservants would follow the queen. That was the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> system. So Ajamila was the illegal husband of a prostitute, <span class="Italic">dāsī,</span> <span class="Italic">dāsī-pati.</span> Actually one should be husband of <span class="Italic">dharma-pati,</span> religiously married, not a friend or a husband of illegal marriage. That is not allowed. <span class="Italic">Dāsī-patir ajāmilaḥ nāmnā... Ajāmila nāmnā.</span> His name was Ajāmila. Why the sound is in...? It is not possible to charge? "Cut, cut cut, cut." <span class="Italic">Naṣṭa-sadācāraḥ. Sadācāra</span> means good behavior. Why good behavior was lost? <span class="Italic">Dāsyaḥ saṁsarga-dūṣitaḥ.</span> Because he was associating with a prostitute, illegal sex. Therefore, anyone who wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must be <span class="Italic">sadācāra.</span> His behavior must be very regulated. <span class="Italic">Asadācārī,</span> unclean, nonregulated, cannot make any progress. If somebody says that "Whatever you like, you can do. There is no difference. You can imagine your own way..." This is going on nowadays. "Whatever you like, you can do. You can imagine your own way of self-realization." But that is not recommended in the Vedic literatures. One must be <span class="Italic">sadācāra.</span> This is the beginning of <span class="Italic">sadācāra,</span> to rise early in the morning, to cleanse, then chant, or chant the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> or, simplified as in the present age, Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> This is the beginning of <span class="Italic">sadācāra.</span> So <span class="Italic">sadācāra</span> means to become freed from sinful reaction. Unless one follows the regulative principles he cannot be freed. And unless one is fully freed from sinful reaction he cannot understand what is God. Those who are not in <span class="Italic">sadācāra,</span> regulative principles, for them... Just like animals, they are not expected to follow any... Of course, by nature they follow regulative principles. Still, but human being, having advanced consciousness, so instead of using it properly, they misuse the advanced consciousness and thus they become lower than animals. The animals, for want of advanced consciousness, cannot follow any regulative principles. But by nature they have got some regulative principle. A human being, advanced consciousness, instead of using it for advance in spiritual life they use it for sense gratification and thus they become lower than the animals. So as soon as one becomes irregulated, without any <span class="Italic">sadācāra,</span> then he doesn't care for any sinful activities for maintaining his body and soul together. He doesn't mind. Their philosophy is, what is called? "Existence is the first law of nature," or something like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Self-preservation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Self-preservation. So self-preservation... They do not know what is self-preservation. That is another ignorance. They consider this body as the self. Their self-preservation means to keep this body. And that is also not possible. If you do not follow regulative principles, it is not possible to keep your body in good condition. That is also not possible. Those who do not follow the regulative principles, mostly they are diseased, some kind. We find in the medical, modern medical shop the customers are educated people. Mass of people, they are not customers in the medical shop. You'll find it. They are not so much diseased. In every gentleman's house, modern, you'll find so many bottles of medicine. But you won't find such medical bottles in any house of less educated persons. They are not so diseased. So this is one of the items. If you want to advance in spiritual life you must follow the regulative principles to rectify your mistakes in the past life and this present life. Without being freed from all contamination nobody can understand God. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ anta gataṁ pāpaṁ:</span> "One who has become completely freed from all kinds of sinful reaction," <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām,</span> "Persons who are engaged in pious activities only," <span class="Italic">te,</span> "such person," <span class="Italic">te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā...</span> [Bg. 7.28]. This life, the material life, is <span class="Italic">dvandva. Dvandva</span> means fighting or quarreling. Every one of us has got nature for fighting with others unnecessarily. Even some people come here with a spirit of fighting with me. So this is called <span class="Italic">dvandva</span> and <span class="Italic">moha.</span> How this fighting spirit becomes developed? On account of illusion. What is that illusion? Accepting this body as self. So if one is contaminated by sinful activity-if he is in illusion, how he can..., illusion of accepting this body as self-what is the meaning of their self-realization? He's illusioned. He'll keep himself in all kinds of contaminated life, and artificially he thinks that by some kind of mystic meditation he'll be all right. This is going on. No. One must follow. Meditation, yogic meditation, is also possible when there is <span class="Italic">yama, niyama, āsana, praṇāyāma</span>-the eight principles of yoga system. And nobody follows the eight principles of yoga system and simply sitting down and meditating, that will not help. The first two steps are <span class="Italic">yama, niyama,</span> then <span class="Italic">āsana,</span> then <span class="Italic">praṇāyāma,</span> then <span class="Italic">pratyāhāra,</span> then <span class="Italic">dhyāna,</span> then <span class="Italic">dhāraṇā,</span> then <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> These are explained in the yogic <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So this man, although born of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> father... Now, here it is said that <span class="Italic">naṣṭa-sadācāra.</span> Although he is born of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> father, his <span class="Italic">ācāra,</span> his dealings for advancing in spiritual life...A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is expected to be truthful, to be self-controlled, to be fully cognizant of spiritual life, practical application in life, <span class="Italic">jñānam, vijñānam, āstikyam,</span> to have complete faith in the statement of the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> That is... That is called <span class="Italic">āstikyam.</span> We, according to our Vedic system, we do not accept any other system of religion because we consider them <span class="Italic">nāstika.</span> That is the primary principle. <span class="Italic">Nāstika</span> means one who does not believe in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He is called <span class="Italic">nāstika.</span> Not that he does not believe in God. One may believe in God, but one who does not believe in the Vedic literature, he is called <span class="Italic">nāstika. Veda na manīyā bauddha haila nāstika.</span> Lord Buddha, although he is accepted as incarnation of God, but because he defied the Vedic principles it is said, <span class="Italic">nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ.</span> Lord Buddha criticized the, I mean to say, sacrificial ceremonies because in the sacrificial ceremonies sometimes there is recommendation of killing an animal. But he was preaching nonviolence. So he criticized even the sacrifice in <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> He criticized. <span class="Italic">Nindasi...</span> But a Vaiṣṇava is praying, "My dear Lord, you are defying the Vedic principles." He knows why the Lord is now defying the Vedic principles; therefore he is devotee. In spite of Lord Buddha's defying the Vedic principles, a devotee is offering him obeisances. <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> He knows the Lord, how He is playing, how He is bewildering the atheistic class of men. The atheistic class of men did not believe in God. Lord Buddha says, "Yes, you don't require to believe in God. There is no God. But you feel yourself that when you are attacked with violence you feel pain. Why should you offer to others?" Because his mission was to stop animal killing. <span class="Italic">Sadaya-hṛdaya-darṣita-paśu-ghātam.</span> The Supreme Lord became too much compassionate when he saw that people are unnecessarily killing animals, as it is going on still. Instead of... At least those who are claiming Buddhist, they are killing animals. Bruce, is it not? Yes. But in the Buddhist religion there is no sanction for killing animals. Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Muhammad, he also did not believe in the Vedic literature. But according to Vedic literature, anyone who does not believe in the Vedic literature, he is <span class="Italic">nāstika.</span> Just like the Mohammedans, they say, "Anyone who does not believe in Koran, he is <span class="Italic">kafir."</span> The Christians say, "Anyone who does not believe in the Bible, they are heathens." That is there everywhere. Similarly, Lord Caitanya said that <span class="Italic">veda na manīyā bauddha haila nāstika.</span> He is giving the definition because we have to follow the great personalities, great <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> That is our process. We do not make any research, or we do not make any statement made by us. We simply accept the injunctions given by great <span class="Italic">ācāryas. Ācāryopāsanam.</span> That is the process of Vedic system. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> One must approach a spiritual master and learn from him. So whatever spiritual master says, that is accepted. <span class="Italic">Sādhu guru śāstra vākya.</span> Real evidence is, it must be stated in the scriptures, it must be explained by the spiritual master or saintly persons. That is evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Śastra-vākya-pramāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śāstra-vākya-pramāṇa.</span> And it should be known through the spiritual master. Just like nowadays <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is being interpreted in so many foolish ways because they do not accept explanation from the authority. They become themselves authorities. Therefore misused. That is not explanation. Somebody is explaining that Kurukṣetra means this body, <span class="Italic">pañca-pāṇḍava</span> means the senses. These are all nonsense. You have to accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. When you cannot understand, you should get it explained by your spiritual master. Therefore one has to accept a spiritual master to understand. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijnanārtham.</span> In order to understand that transcendental science one must approach a bona fide spiritual master. That is injunction. So here it is said that <span class="Italic">kānyakubje dvijaḥ. Dvijaḥ</span> means he was offered the sacred thread. That means he was born in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. <span class="Italic">Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.</span> Everyone is born a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> a foolish. <span class="Italic">Sudra</span> means a foolish man who simply laments. That is the real meaning of <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Anyone who has no intelligence, he is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> We also generally say, <span class="Italic">gadāh,</span> less intelligent. So <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they are called higher caste. According to their... <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa,</span> first-class because his intelligence is first-class. <span class="Italic">Kṣatriya,</span> his intelligence is second-class. <span class="Italic">Vaiśya,</span> his intelligence is third-class. And <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> means fourth-class. And less than <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> they are called <span class="Italic">pañcama, caṇḍāla.</span> They are accepted as animals, those who are less than <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> This is the Vedic system. Now, here it is said that this Ajamila, <span class="Italic">dvija... Dvija</span> means he was properly initiated, second birth. First birth by father, mother, is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Anyone, even if he is born in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, the natural birth is considered as <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But if there is <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra,</span> then he's accepted as born <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> born <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Still, one is born <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he has to undergo the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras.</span> So our, this... Now it is known as Hindu society although the "Hindu" word is given by the Mohammedans. It is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> or <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> society, who very strictly follow the four divisions, social divisions of <span class="Italic">varṇa</span>-<span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> <span class="Italic">śūdra</span>-and four divisions of spiritual life-<span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So our, the Vedic system is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇa</span> means the social order. <span class="Italic">Āśrama</span> means spiritual division. Therefore those who are following strictly the Vedic principle, that family life is called <span class="Italic">gṛhastha āśrama. Āśrama.</span> Whenever you add this word <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> there is spiritual significance. So all the division-<span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>-they are known as <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> Anyone can understand <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> As soon as there is <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> that means "Here some men, saintly persons, spiritually advanced persons, lives." That is <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> So that <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> when a student follows the regulative principles, he is supposed to be situated in <span class="Italic">brahmacārī āśrama.</span> A householder living with family, husband, wife, children, if they are following strictly the regulative principles-<span class="Italic">gṛhastha āśrama.</span> Similarly, retired life, if he is following the regulative principles-the <span class="Italic">vānaprastha āśrama.</span> Similarly, a renounced life, <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> if he is following the regulative principles, that is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa āśrama.</span> Not that imitating somebody, I put on a saffron dress and I become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and by begging I live. This has killed the whole Hindu society or the <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> society. Unqualified persons, they do not know the regulative principles but for solution of economic problem they dress themselves. This is Kali-yuga. They will pass on simply by the dress without any knowledge. So here also, although Ajamila was born of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> father and he was strictly following the regulative principles of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>-that will be stated-but he fell. He fell in love with a prostitute And therefore his characters were lost. <span class="Italic">Naṣṭa-sadācāraḥ.</span> The reason is why? <span class="Italic">Dāsyāḥ saṁsarga-dūṣitaḥ.</span> Because he associated with a prostitute, therefore his all regulative principles became lost. And as soon as you are lost of regulative principles then you take to all kinds of sinful activities. The regulative principles will keep you on the standard of life. If you give it up, then immediately you fall down, <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So this man Ajamila, because he was <span class="Italic">durācāra, naṣṭa-sadācāra,</span> lost of all regulative principles on account of associating with a prostitute, then, although he was born of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, he became... His livelihood was <span class="Italic">juha</span>(?), <span class="Italic">bandy-akṣaiḥ,</span> cheating and stealing. <span class="Italic">Bandy-akṣaiḥ kaitavaiś cauryaiḥ. Cauryaiḥ</span> means stealing. <span class="Italic">Garhitāṁ vṛttim āsthitaḥ.</span> This kind of profession is <span class="Italic">garhitā. Garhitāṁ</span> means... <span class="Italic">Hitā</span> means beneficial. But this profession is <span class="Italic">garhitā</span> because it is not beneficial. Ultimately he will be punished either by the king's law or by the God's law. I can escape the king's law by doing something which is abominable but I cannot escape God's law. That is not possible. Therefore, although he is thinking that "Now I am cheating this person," or "I am stealing and getting some profit," that is not good for him. Just like a man is killing some man, another man. So that is not good for him because as soon as he will be arrested he'll be hanged. So they think that "I am cheating the state, I am cheating God, and I can go on gratifying my senses by all these activities," but that is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> as <span class="Italic">garhitā. Garhitā</span> means it is not beneficial for you." <span class="Italic">Na sādhu mānye yato ātmano 'yam.</span> In another place it is said, "These kinds of activities, <span class="Italic">vikarma,</span> is not good ultimately." <span class="Italic">Na sādhu mānye yato ātmano 'yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> the self, is different from this body-that is the first lesson in spiritual life-still, this body, although temporary, but as soon as you accept this material body you will have to suffer according to the body. If you get a dog's body you suffer according to that. If you get a man's body... Suffering will be there more or less as soon as you get this material body. Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva said, <span class="Italic">na sādhu mānye:</span> "You are acting abominable. It is not good because you are already suffering in this body." Otherwise why you are stealing? You are in want of money. You are suffering. Therefore necessity is now law. Therefore you are accepting. Even you know that stealing is bad, still, you are accepting it because that is a suffering. So for some of your activities in the past life you are now suffering, and if you go on, continuing committing this nonsense, then you will again, you will have to again accept a body and you'll suffer. Therefore <span class="Italic">garhitāṁ.</span> There are so many things to know but these things are not discussed nowadays. Very cheap thing: "You can do whatever you like. You simply meditate and become God, that's all." So much cheating is going on everywhere, all over the w</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">orld. So-called yogis, they go, "Oh, you meditate. You are... And as soon as you realize, you are God, within six months." No. Therefore in this age the only method... It is a concession to the fallen people of this world, this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> They 'll not be able to follow all the regulative principles; therefore they must commit all kinds of abominable activities. Under the circumstances the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> or God has given a concession that you simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and gradually you will be elevated to the highest position of spiritual life. Other things you cannot follow. You are already fallen. So you take to this process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> without any offense. And in order to save yourself from the offenses, a little austerity that you cannot have illicit sex life. Why should you have illicit sex life? Everyone's need is sex life. <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam.</span> These are the bodily needs. So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> has sanctioned, "All right. You can live peacefully by married life and have sex life for children, good children." That is allowed. But why should you have illicit sex life? What is this? Irresponsible life. "I shall not take responsibility of family life, and I shall go on as so-called bachelor and have illicit life." But that is not good. That is <span class="Italic">garhitāṁ. Na sādhu mānye:</span> "This is not good." This is the advice of Vedic literature. Ultimately you'll suffer. You are thinking at the present moment that you are avoiding suffering because family life is very responsible life. So if you think that family life is responsible, yes, it is responsible life. If you don't take, if you cannot take the responsibility, then remain as a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> Why should you marry? Yes. If you practice <span class="Italic">brahmācārya,</span> then you become free, seventy-five percent freedom immediately. But you do not want to undergo the austerities of a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> and still, you want to remain as an unmarried man. Everywhere in the world it is going on. This is increasing. That is stated here, <span class="Italic">sadācāra. Naṣṭa-sadācāro dāsyāḥ saṁsarga-dūṣitaḥ.</span> The illicit connection with man and woman will certainly make him abominable, fallen down to this abominable life. I... When I was... In my younger days, when I was in business, so I was to take agency one of big company, Smith's Transit Company. So they had to... I had to give some guarantee of my honesty. So in that program the question was whether married or unmarried. Because unmarried man mostly become dishonest. So that inquiry was there, "Whether he is married?" Married man cannot be dishonest because he has got responsibility. If he is arrested he will be insulted in his family. His family members will be in difficulty. Therefore he does not commit dishonesty very easily unless it is absolutely... But that should not be done. But unmarried man, because he has got no responsibility, he commits all kinds of sinful activity. That's a fact. Therefore in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we do not allow such illicit sex life, no. You must get yourself married. And practically, we are seeing, that is very effective and that is going on nicely. All right. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi) Yesterday I had a talk with Bhagavati Hema.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I have got most of my queries and answers but they remain, some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can inquire. But sometimes wrong report is published.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> People releases wrong report. I am a responsible man, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but some irresponsible report is published in that paper, that "Bhaktivedanta Swami says that Kṛṣṇa is everything and nothing." That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> The very reading was abominable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (unintelligible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I really couldn't believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the reading matter he said that, "He was trained by his father to worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, to observe Rathayātrā, and he was taught <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga."</span> These are all true. But anyone who worships Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and who follows the Hindu ceremonies, Rathayātrā, how he can say that "Hinduism nothing"? Just see how rascaldom. This is contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, there is reason for that. Because that paper, the owner of that press is a Jain. And the Jains have a natural antipathy towards the ...?...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, just see. So how biased man can report? So therefore we are avoiding reports.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, tape may be. But he also taped, that man. But he has misrepresented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I should like to ask one question, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, you can ask. But kindly publish rightly. Don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (unintelligible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Still you want to inquire from her?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> From the entire business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can inquire from me. In my presence, you can inquire from me. Because, after all, they are my students, they may not be able to reply thoroughly. So if you have got any inquiries you can ask from me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes. Yes. Mahārāja, I am a teacher of Sanskrit and English in one of the higher secondary schools here and I am very much interested...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you join us. Simply lip sympathy will not do. Just like these boys and girls, they have joined wholeheartedly. So I do not find any Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I am ready to join but for my family liabilities. Is there is some...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can join. You are family man, so it is not that we have no family men. We have got many family men. Now, they are all family. These girls, they have got a husband. And some of them, they are living separately. Just like one of my students, Professor Howard Wheeler. He is married man. He is living separately. Not separately. He is also conducting our, one establishment, New Vrindaban. So it is not that one has to live with us. He can live separately also, but his whole life is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I would like to live with you and tour with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not come and live and tour with me? Who forbids you? But it is not possible to pay anything for your family expenditure. That is difficulty. We cannot pay anything but you can live with your family. That responsibility you can take. But I cannot pay you. That's not possible. Because we are maintaining by collecting alms. In that case it is not possible to pay something. There is... [break] It is selling all over Europe. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, could you employ me in some...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, employ, I can employ in any way. But there is no payment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I am M.A. in English, M.A. in Hindi. I am trying to devote myself to this work...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So please come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But for my family liabilities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What amount you want for your family, minimum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Five hundred a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. Yes, you require five hundred. I know that. That is not much. To maintain a family nowadays five hundred rupees is not much but where is the money? How can I pay you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I would be a very good asset to your publications work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I know. You are qualified, educated boy. You can do it. But one thing I can do, that you can live with your family just like they are living. That I can arrange. And whatever food we can provide you have to accept. We can... We can arrange for the education of your children also, everything. But we cannot pay anything. That is not possible. We can take charge of the husband and wife. We can take charge of your children. But it is not possible to pay. And besides that, when there is question of payment the service is not good because the payment means he is serving the money. He is not serving the cause. (tape of <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> plays for a second)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> His old mother listens to these chantings. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he has appeared to establish <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> So what is the <span class="Italic">dharma</span> according...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Śāstra-dharma. Śāstra</span> means <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājī-pratiṣṭhā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that <span class="Italic">śāstra veda dharma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Vedic <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that? Explain it practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Yama, niyama, samādhi, dhyāna...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is the process. So what is the end of <span class="Italic">dharma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Self-realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that self?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That is to be realized. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. One has no idea what is <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> what is the end, but he becomes, "Oh, I have appeared for establishing <span class="Italic">dharma."</span> And when he is asked, "What is that <span class="Italic">dharma?"</span> "It is to be realized." Then what you have realized that you are preaching <span class="Italic">dharma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Sadācāra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sadācāra</span> is the means. <span class="Italic">Sadācāra</span> is not the end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Can I know as to what made these young people want to leave the affluent present society and join this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are sincere, seeking after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Pardon, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are sincere, sincerely seeking after. Their material business is finished because they have enjoyed enough of material things. Now there is spiritual inquiry. That is natural. When our material necessities are complete, we enjoy, then next stage is spiritual hankering. And that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> After finishing <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍīya</span> life... <span class="Italic">Karma-kāṇḍīya</span> life means you do pious activities and enjoy life. That is called <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍīya.</span> So... But the fact is that even you get your birth in a very rich family, you cannot avoid the sufferings of this material nature. Just like yesterday we had an interview with Holkar(?), His Highness Holkar, the old gentleman. So he was a king. He has got very beautiful wife, very beautiful family, very palatial building, but he is not happy, we saw. So the foolish people, they do not know that in this material life there is no happiness. They hanker after these palatial buildings, the motor cars, the bank balance, and so on, so on. Therefore those who have enjoyed all these things but have not become happy, there is another inquiry: "How to become happy?" [break] ...say America, they have enjoyed material life. Their children have enjoyed material life to the fullest extent but they are not happy. Therefore they have come to this spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Last night in your learned discourse you said that you're supposed to found a temple in this city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But you preach the Vedic <span class="Italic">mārga.</span> Don't you think that instead of building a temple, <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> in this <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> model would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And without temple the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> will be <span class="Italic">vyabhicāris.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> becomes a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we... Wherever we have got a center we have got a temple and at the same time teaching. These two things must go parallel. If simply dry teachings go on and there is no temple worship, then gradually he will glide down to <span class="Italic">vyabhicāri</span> instead of <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Besides the chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and arousing(?) this Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the people, what else are you doing to establish the way...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have seen this morning. We are teaching every day the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> They are not simply chanting. Their chanting is based on understanding. Therefore they are sticking.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, the educational system of this country has so much deteriorated. I have been studying. I see young people of different colleges, boys and girls taking to LSD even in this city and doing to all sorts of nonsense. What is the best...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was explaining. As soon as there is indulgence in illicit sex life, all bad qualification will come. That I was explaining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> And Mahārāja, what are your impressions of the youth of this country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no estimation of this country or that country. I know everywhere, because spiritual education is lacking, everywhere the boys and girls are fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Is secularism coming in way of spreading spiritual education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Secularism is a bogus thing. You see? That is an indulgence, "Whatever you like, you can do. Whatever religion you follow, that's all..." No. That is not good. The state should be responsible for the spiritual progress of the citizens. Now, especially in our country, we say it is Hindustan, Bhāratavarṣa. So we are not giving the <span class="Italic">bhāratīya</span> or Hindu spiritual cultural education. So that's a great loss of the secular state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Do you think that the present democratic system will be able to impart a spiritual education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Then what system do you advocate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course, so far Vedic culture is concerned, they advocated monarchy because the one man's training, a good king guided by the brahminical culture, although it was autocratic sometimes, but because the king was very cultured there was no possibility of doing any harm to the citizens. But democracy means simply they are given the post by votes, and they may be all rascals. Then what they can think of good to the citizens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, don't you think that monarchy (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is also not possible. And therefore we are training people to be Kṛṣṇa conscious. And when the Kṛṣṇa conscious people will elect Kṛṣṇa conscious leaders there will be peace and prosperity. And now, because the minority is Kṛṣṇa conscious, they cannot elect Kṛṣṇa conscious leaders and therefore havoc is being played.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, do you think the West is being Hinduized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The "Hinduized" is a sectarian view. We are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I mean this, being brought up on <span class="Italic">sanātana</span> culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic ways. Yes. You can... The perfect word is Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is original civilization. Out of Vedic civilization there are so many outcome now, but if you go originally to the Vedic civilization, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you will find the word is <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> That means to follow the Vedic way of life means to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Vedic way means they are following principles, regulative principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> So what principle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was explaining. That is a big principle. But it has been shortened, shortened in this age. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the Kali-yuga you cannot reform the whole population by any other means except this <span class="Italic">harer nāma.</span> Therefore we are introducing Hare Kṛṣṇa movement everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, do the Western and Eastern societies respond differently to this call...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You cannot say that. Two plus two equal to four everywhere, East and West. There is no difference, East and West. It is scientific. It is <span class="Italic">vijñaṇa.</span> So when you call of, talk of science, there is no difference of understanding in the East and West. The same thing is understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Mahārāja, (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Varnāśrama-dharma...</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Qualified. Therefore we want qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> qualified <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> At the present moment, without being qualified, they are passing on as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> That is not <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> Without being qualified they are all <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> all <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> But when they are properly trained and qualified, then it is <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> real <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Where are they to be trained, then? How are they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we are proposing. When we open a center we shall train anyone. It doesn't matter whether he is born in a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> family or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. Just like they are born in a different family other than <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> but they are now <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> because after being trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (Hindi) ...regard, you said that monarchy and democracy, both are systems which cannot help this cause. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why cannot help? If... Monarchy means the king was properly trained up. Similarly, in the democracy, if people are properly trained up, then they will vote for nice men and there will be nice government. Now, because the people are not trained, they are practically asses. The votes of the asses, what has the meaning? If the majority are asses, then one ass will be elected. That's all. So when the executive head is an ass what benefit he can do to the people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> I see.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Should I copy it down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you take it. You take it. Type it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Prabhupāda, in Calcutta Madhudviṣa advertised like that at one meeting, and the next day a man came...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only one man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Two men came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> With his six children and his wife, they were prepared, "Let us live here. We will see."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> And another old man that was so old that he was ready to die. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you write, "Young men." No, even old man, there is no question. That we can test, whether he is able, he is a qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> First of all he is qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> You were going to Peruda(?) that day, so we said, "When we return, then you come and join us." But when we returned they didn't come. They changed their mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They cannot. They cannot. Only young men can join. Old men cannot join. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Asoka Kumar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, I remember. So please, after finishing your education you come and join this great movement. They are joining Communist movement, this movement, that movement. Why not a real genuine movement for the welfare of the whole?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> I am not joining any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> I want to join...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally they join. Generally they join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> My brother also agrees to stay with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> From today I am ready to join you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you finish your education. That will be a good qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Why not you are paying a visit in Lakhpur(?). There is a very big Gītā Mandir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere there is Gītā Mandir. Here there is also big Gītā Mandir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> No, there... Here they have mixture of many gods. Not like that. There is only one <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> and all, the whole temple, belongs to <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if they invite, I can go. Why don't you ask them to invite us? Then we can go immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Whole temple there is a <span class="Italic">pracāra</span>(?) <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how many preachers they have produced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> You must be knowing that Vidyananda, Swami Vidyananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he's a great nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Oh, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> He has constructed that from Gujarat. He's a Gujārati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> He constructed a temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen in Ahmedabad his temple. He established one deity, a woman shape, and there is no Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">"Gītā." "Gītā"</span> means a woman. So I don't think he has full understanding of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> He has money; he has spent. That's all. But he does not understand <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> means unless one takes Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead he does not understand anything of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> That is the test. He may advertise himself as scholar or this or that, but our only test is whether he accepts Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the test. Is that person accepting Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He himself accepts that "I am God." Is it not? Therefore he's a foolish. He is squandering money, public money. That's all. That is his business. He might have some qualification to collect money, but he does not know what is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> He's all (unclear).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I think he is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> He is dead now or he... Sadhanananda is dead, Swami Sadhananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know. So that is the test. That is the test. Therefore it is a revolutionary movement. Even so-called followers of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> they will be caught up by this movement as rascals. Because the real purpose of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> they do not know. Real purpose of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is to know Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That you will find in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi madhava</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> And Arjuna says that "Whatever You have said, they're all right and I accept them <span class="Italic">in toto</span> without any revision." So Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead." One who does not understand Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person, what he has read <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span> He is useless. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply has labored. That's all. That is the test. Don't you agree to this point? So anyone who does not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has no knowledge of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> He immediately becomes foolish. That is our test. So Muktananda, what do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Muktananda:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the test, whether he has understood. In the Seventh Chapter,</div>
<div class="Verse">mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Anyone... How one simply by concentrating his mind upon Me," <span class="Italic">mayy āsakta,</span> "with <span class="Italic">āsakti..."</span> <span class="Italic">Āsakti</span> means attachment, love. <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta-manāḥ.</span> Mind attached to Kṛṣṇa in love. <span class="Italic">Yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.</span> And performing the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, mad-āśrayaḥ,</span> under the disciplinary action by a bona fide spiritual master, <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ. Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ:</span> "Then he can understand without any doubt and fully what I am." That means one who has not understood Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has not found the yoga properly. And why? That is <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ,</span> he does not follow the disciplic succession. <span class="Italic">Mad āśrayaḥ.</span> And in the beginning, in Fourth Chapter it is said, <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So these foolish persons, they do not follow all these principles; therefore they cannot understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Anyone... We say... It may appear to be very strong word but that's a fact. (Hindi) That's a strong word, that's all right, but he's a <span class="Italic">chor.</span> (Hindi) Strong language used here... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> (unclear)... From the very day I saw this movement, I have intent only in Kṛṣṇa, not in any other movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is our movement. Wherever we go, we find out sincere persons, immediately attract. Yes. But if he's not sincere, we cannot attract. If he's sincere, immediately attract. That is the value of this movement. All my students, they were attracted only because they were sincere. Anyone sincere in seeking after the Absolute Truth will be attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> I am not getting ...(unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ekāgra. Ekāgra. Yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ,</span> therefore it is said. "One has to perform this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> under My representative." <span class="Italic">Mad-āśrayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> I am very grateful to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura-<span class="Italic">Prārthanā. Āśraya laiyā bhaje, kṛṣṇa nāhi tare tyāge:</span> "One who takes <span class="Italic">āśraya,</span> shelter of a devotee, Kṛṣṇa does not give him up. Kṛṣṇa accepts him." <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ... **.</span> Because if that person who is giving shelter, if he's pleased, Kṛṣṇa is immediately... If he recommends a fool, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa, here is a devotee," Kṛṣṇa will accept immediately. It doesn't matter whether he's a fool or rascal. Because he is recommended by representative, he will be accepted. <span class="Italic">Yasya pra...</span> This is the meaning of <span class="Italic">yasya prasādad bhagavat-pra...</span> Without his recommendation there is no entry in Kṛṣṇa's kingdom. <span class="Italic">Yasya-prasādad na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.</span> If he displeases Kṛṣṇa's representative he has no entrance to the Kṛṣṇa's kingdom, however learned he may be or whatever he may be. Immediately rejected. In a business office, suppose a secretary is there. A clerk does not accept the order of the secretary. Immediately he should be dismissed. In my personal experience, when I was young manager in a big chemical concern, one correspondent clerk, he disobeyed me. I reported to the head boss. He immediately came and he said, "Get out immediately from the office." And he wanted to plead in so many ways. Said, "No, I don't want. If you don't go out, then I shall call my doorman. He will forcibly get you out. Get out." I was sorry because this man is dismissed immediately, but he took. Disobedient... "Obedience is first discipline." So if Kṛṣṇa's representative is disobeyed-"Get out immediately." Kṛṣṇa is very strict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> (unclear) ...From tomorrow he was not able to get (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just see. Yes. Therefore in our system <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇavāparādha</span> is the greatest offense, to commit offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava, and spiritual master is to be considered the first Vaiṣṇava. If there is <span class="Italic">aparādha,</span> that is great, greatest offense. That will spoil the whole spiritual life. These are stated in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> In <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</span> you'll find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> In yesterday's paper I read that somebody donated some land to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. He has proposed to donate; not he has done. Where you learned this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> In that (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, somebody has promised. Somebody has promised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> And it will (unclear) Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mandir,</span> I will possibly able to get (unclear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Swamiji, you are here still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if somebody gives me land I may go on staying here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> No, no, father and mother, they are forcing me to leave you all in my home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> It is nearby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your father, mother, cannot come here?</div>
