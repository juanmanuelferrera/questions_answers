<div class="Purp-para"></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have you translated or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Inconceivable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Inconceivable or mystic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mystic power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I am just collecting what Śrīla Prabhupāda explained, the different <span class="Italic">acintya-śaktis</span> that we observe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here the <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti</span> is working, this mist, fog. You have no power to drive it away. Beyond your power. You can explain with some juggling of words...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passer-by:</span> Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good morning. ...that "Such chemicals, such molecules, such this, that," there are so many things. But (laughing) you have no power to drive it away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah. They have no explanation how the mist is formed. They call...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can do. That is, I can do also. It is not very great credit. But if you know how it is formed, then counteract it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We know how it is formed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you know, then you discover, counteracting. Just like formerly, in the warfare the atomic <span class="Italic">brahmāstra</span> was thrown. On the other side... <span class="Italic">brahmāstra</span> means excessive heat. So they caused something, they transformed into water. Because after heat, there must be water. So where is that science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is just like milk. Milk looks white, but it is just water. They call it, it's a colloidal suspension of proteins, these caseins, in water. So similarly, this fog is just a colloidal suspension of water in the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you create some fire. It will be immediately driven away. Water can be driven away by fire. So you create. That you cannot. You just shot one bomb. There will be some heat, and all the mist will go away. Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That would blow up the planet. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Water can be counteracted by fire or air. Everyone knows it. So you do it, suspension. So this is for you mystic power. You can talk all nonsense, but you cannot act against it. Therefore it is mystic power. So similarly, there are so many things. That is <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti.</span> You cannot think of even. By nature's way, immediately the sun rises-no more mist. All finished. A little temperature increase of the sun, all finished. <span class="Italic">Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.</span> This example is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> <span class="Italic">Nīhāra,</span> this is called <span class="Italic">nīhāra.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">nīhāra</span> is immediately dissipated by <span class="Italic">bhāskara,</span> by the sun, similarly, if one can awaken his dormant devotion, then all finished, all his reaction of sinful activities, finished. <span class="Italic">Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.</span> You just create... You calculate sun is composition of this chemical, that chemical. Just create one sun and throw it. Simply theoretical future, bluff and juggling of words, that's not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is what the research means. Research means to understand what was not known before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Research means you admit that you are all fools and rascals. Research meant for whom? Who does not know. Otherwise where is the question of research? You do not know. You admit that. So so many mystic powers are there. You do not know how it is being done. Therefore you have to accept inconceivable power. And without accepting this principle of inconceivable power, there is no meaning of God. Not like that Bala-yogī became a God. So these are for the rascals, fools. But those who are intelligent, they will stress the inconceivable power. Just like we accept Kṛṣṇa as God-inconceivable power. We accept Rāma-inconceivable power. Not so cheaply. One rascal comes and says, "I am incarnation of God." Another rascal accepts. It is not like that. "Ramakrishna is God." We do not accept. We must see the inconceivable mystic power. Just like Kṛṣṇa, as a child, lifted a hill. This is inconceivable mystic power. Rāmacandra, He constructed a bridge of stone without pillar. The stone began to float: "Come on." So that is an inconceivable power. And because you cannot adjust this inconceivable power, when they are described, you say, "Oh, these are all stories." What is called? Mythology. But these great, great sages, Vālmīki and Vyāsadeva and other <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they simply wasted their time in writing mythology? Such learned scholars? And they have not interpreted that it is mythology. They have accepted it as actual fact. There was forest fire. All the friends and cowherd boys, they became disturbed. They began to see towards Kṛṣṇa: "Kṛṣṇa, what to do?" "All right." He simply swallowed up the whole fire. This is inconceivable mystic power. That is God. <span class="Italic">Aiśvarya-vairāgya-yaśo-'vabhodha-vīrya-śriyā.</span> These six opulences in full. That is God. That inconceivable power, inconceivable energy or mystic power, we have got also. Very minute quantity. So many things are going on within our body. We cannot explain. The same example. My nails are coming exactly in the form. Although it is spoiled by disease, again it is coming. I do not know what machinery is going on, and the nail is coming, exactly fitting the position and everything. That is coming from my body. So that is mystic power. Even it is mystic power for me and to the doctors, everyone... They cannot explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:</span> The doctors are marveling at the complex nature of the human brain. They are amazed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. But they are rascal. It is not the brain that is working. It is the spirit soul that is working. The same thing: the computer machine. The rascal will think that a computer machine is working. No. The man is working. He pushes the button, then it works. Otherwise, what is the value of this machine? You keep the machine for thousands of years, it will not work. When another man will come, put the button, then it will work. So who is working? The machine is working or the man is working? And the man is also another machine. And it is working due to the presence of <span class="Italic">Paramātmā,</span> God. Therefore, ultimately, God is working. A dead man cannot work. So how long a man remains living? So long the <span class="Italic">Paramātmā</span> is there, <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is there. Even the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is there, if <span class="Italic">Paramātmā</span> does not give him intelligence, he cannot work. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> God is giving me intelligence, "You put this button." Then I put this button. So ultimately Kṛṣṇa is working. Another, untrained man cannot come and work on it because there is no intelligence. And a particular man who is trained up, he can work. So these things are going on. Ultimately comes to Kṛṣṇa. What you are researching, what you are talking, that is also Kṛṣṇa is doing. Kṛṣṇa is giving you in... You, you prayed for this facility to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is giving you. Sometimes you find accidentally the experiment is successful. So when Kṛṣṇa sees that you are so much harassed in experimental, "All right do it." Just like Yaśodā Mā was trying to tie Kṛṣṇa, but she could not do. But when Kṛṣṇa agreed, it was possible. Similarly, this accident means Kṛṣṇa helps you: "All right, you have worked so hard, take this result." Everything is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is coming from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say, "Kṛṣṇa didn't give me the proper steps how to do the experiments."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he gives you. Otherwise how you are doing it. Whatever you are doing, that is by Kṛṣṇa's grace. And when you are still favorable, then Kṛṣṇa will give you more facilities. Kṛṣṇa will give you facility, will favor you, as much as you desire, not more than that. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva...</span> As much proportionately you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, the intelligence will come. If you fully surrender, then full intelligence will come. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Wet? (Asking about the ground)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No. Little wet, but not much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "You fully surrender. I give you full protection." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> He will give you full intelligence. [break] ...these facts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That will be our great success when the scientific world will admit. Let them admit simply. Then our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will (be) great success. You simply admit, "Yes, there is God and mystic power." Then our movement is very successful. And that's a fact. Simply talking like a nonsense amongst the nonsense, that is not a very great credit. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> One blind man is leading other blind man. What is the value of such? They are all blind. And so long one remains blind and rascal, he does not accept God. This is the test. As soon as we see that he does not accept God, he is blind, rascal, fool, whatever you can call. Take it for granted, however, whatever he may be. He's a rascal. On this principle we can challenge so many big, big chemist, philosopher, whoever comes to us. We say, "You are demon." The other chemist came, you brought him, that Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Hm. Chouri.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chouri. (laughing) So I told him that "You are a demon." But he was not angry. He admitted. And all his argument was refuted. Perhaps you remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, in fact, he was telling that "Kṛṣṇa didn't give me all the procedures, steps, how to do the experiment." He was saying like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why shall I give you? You are a rascal, you are against Kṛṣṇa, why Kṛṣṇa will give you facility? If you are against Kṛṣṇa and you want the credit without Kṛṣṇa, that's not possible. You must be submissive first of all. Then Kṛṣṇa will give you all facilities. Just like we dare to face any chemist, any scientist, any philosopher. Why? On the strength of Kṛṣṇa, we believe that "There is Kṛṣṇa. When I shall talk with him, Kṛṣṇa will give give me intelligence." This is the basics. Otherwise, from qualification, standard, they are very much qualified. We are common laymen before them. But how do we challenge them? Because we know. Just like a small child He can challenge a very big man because he knows, "My father is there." He is catching the hand of the father, and he's sure that "Nobody can do anything to me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I want to make sure the meaning of <span class="Italic">Tad apy aphalatāṁ jātaṁ. Teṣām ātmābhimāninām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tad apy aphalatāṁ jātaṁ. Teṣām ātmābhimān..., bālakānām anāśritya govinda-caraṇa-dvayam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. "The human form of life becomes spoiled for those..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Who do not try to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Simply he dies like animal." That's all. Just like the cats and dogs, they also take birth. They eat, sleep, and beget children, and die. The human life is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Jāta</span> means the species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jāta. Jāta</span> means born. <span class="Italic">Aphalatāṁ jātam. Jāta</span> means it becomes futile. Futile. The human form of life becomes futile if he does not accept <span class="Italic">govinda-caraṇa. Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> If he's not convinced that "I worship the original Personality of Godhead Govinda," then he's spoiled. That's all. His life is spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmābhimāninām</span> means the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmā, dehātmā-māninām.</span> "I am this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So those self-centered...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Self? They have no information of the self. These rascals, they think, "I am this body." <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> means body, <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> means self, <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> means mind. So this <span class="Italic">ātmābhimānī</span> means bodily concept of life. <span class="Italic">Bālaka. Bālaka</span> means a fool, child, <span class="Italic">bālaka. Ātmābhimānināṁ bālakānām.</span> Those who are under the bodily concept of life, they are like children, fools, or animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So I plan to expound the principle of transmigration through this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Transmigration. <span class="Italic">Bhramadbhiḥ. Bhramadbhiḥ</span> means transmigration, wandering from one body to another. Just like I am here. I have got my this body, a dress, covering. And when I go India, this is not required. So they are taking that the body has evolved like that. But no. Here, under certain condition, I accept this dress. In another place, under certain condition, I accept another dress. So I am the important, not this dress. But these rascals are studying the dress only. That is called <span class="Italic">ātmābhimānām,</span> considering of the dress, body. <span class="Italic">Bālakānām.</span> Just see. They bring here dogs for passing stool. Dog stool is so very much infectious. The diphtheria and other germs, they are grown. But these rascals they do not know. They distribute dog stool everywhere. But cow dung, there is no cow dung. <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says cow dung is pure. That is neglected. Dog stool is pure. This is their intelligence. They give signboard: "Littering illegal"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But dog stool is not illegal. Just see how foolish they are. If you drop a paper on this grass, that is illegal. But you can get your dogs pass stool, it doesn't matter. This is their intelligence. They will not allow if you are bringing one mango from other part of the country, but they will allow dog also bringing so many germs. They do not know. Dog also brings so many germs, infectious germs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is why they were very careful. When the astronauts from the moon, when they come back on the surface of the planet, they thought there might be some germs which they do not know yet. So they put it in quarantine for several days, to make sure that they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all make sure whether he had gone there, and then talk of all these things. (laughing) I am not sure they are going there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> You know they made another blunder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> They made a spaceship that they wanted to orbit around the earth so that they could send men and ship an outpost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> A house, station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> So they sent it up and it failed. It cost two billion dollars or something, squandered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see why they are wasting time in that way? Money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> They were criticized in the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fool. Simply childish. <span class="Italic">Bālaka.</span> What are they gaining? For the last, how many years they are trying? For going to the moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Russia started in 1957. First sputnik where Gagarin was there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-five years. So they could not get anything, not a single farthing even. Still, they are doing. Just see, obstinacy. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita.</span> This is called chewing the chewed. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> They will never be successful. So I am a layman. When I wrote that <span class="Italic">Easy Journey?</span> In 1950, 67. How many years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Six years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not 67, 57. Sixteen years before. They are all childish. I am a layman. It will never be successful. It is already written there in my <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets.</span> Here also, that, some press reporter asked me in San Francisco, when I landed, "What is your position about this moon planet?" "It is simply a waste of time and energy. That's all. You cannot go there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have very big plan in the future, going to the surface of the Mars planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is future. That is all your statement, future. With future hope you become a big man. That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Future, about ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever... It may be one year, but we do not accept such proposition. We want to see what you have done now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> First of all they have to develop the methods how to do it by a small scale...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In my childhood I was thinking... The tramcar is going on trolley. So I was thinking I shall stand on the tram line and just take a stick and touch the wire and I will go. I was planning like that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> [break] without knowing Kṛṣṇa, is this a struggle for existence, any activity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Activity without knowing the purpose of it, that is struggle for existence. You must know why you are working so hard. What for I shall work? The aim of life is missing. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ.</span> They do not know it. Therefore failure, confusion, hopelessness. All the results of this world, hopelessness. Is it not? What is one... Show one result, that it is very successful, hopeful. Just like, say, moon planet-hopelessness. What is there? They spend so much time and money, but what is this? Hopelessness. They do not know. All scientists are working, all politicians are financing, but result is hopelessness. Is it not? Similarly, everything they are doing, but they are so rascal, they will never admit that "We are failure." Still they will stick, "Yes, we are success... Future, in ten years we shall do it. Never mind." I have seen, one man was condemned to death in Allahabad high-court. So the lawyer was assuring, "Don't be disappointed. I shall get you out by appeal. Don't be disappointed." I have seen it. That lawyer was very big lawyer, an Englishman, Mr. Allston. And one man was condemned to death. He killed his servant very mercilessly. And the case was... He was a doctor, medical practitioner. So he was condemned to death. So after the condemnation, when he was coming out of the courtroom, I saw that he was flattering, "Don't be disappointed. I shall get you out by appeal." This is going on. He wants to bluff him, but this is the high-court judgement. How there can be appeal? There may be appeal in the Supreme Court, but he is simply bluffing. Just like medical men. They'll repeatedly give you medicine, "All right, let me try this. This pill you try. This pill you try." They will never admit, "This is hopeless." This is going on. Bluffing, simply bluffing. Cheating, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> If they admit they are failures, they'll never get any more grants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see. All utopian. One platform... It is called <span class="Italic">ākāśa-puṣpa, ākāśa-puṣpa,</span> to get flower from the sky. It is called <span class="Italic">ākāśa-puṣpa.</span> This kind of plan is called <span class="Italic">ākāśa-puṣpa. Ākāśa-puṣpa.</span> Or the <span class="Italic">bakāṇḍa-nyāya. Bakāṇḍa,</span> the testicle of the bull and the duck, he is expecting, "Here is a fish. It will drop, and I will take it." He is following. Have you seen? In India we have seen many. The bull is going on, on the..., and the <span class="Italic">baka</span> is going on. And whole day and night, he is after that. "It is a fish, big fish. It will drop and I shall take." <span class="Italic">Bakāṇḍa-nyāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There is also a bird, Śrīla Prabhupāda; it is called heron.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Heron? I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah. They have long beaks. They also, they are always with the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">baka.</span> We call <span class="Italic">baka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are all the time... They stay mostly in wet lands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">bakāṇḍa-nyāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The scientists, when we say that "The attempts that you are doing are no good." Then they want to make sure that what I am saying is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because I see that you are rascal, therefore I am right. You are rascal. You don't admit, but I see that you are rascal. You don't admit, but I see that you are a rascal. Therefore I am right. This is the argument. You are so rascal that you cannot admit your rascaldom. Just like this moon planet expedition. But I, sixteen years before, I told that these are rascals. Therefore I am right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They claim that "We have done so much."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What have you done? You have simply spoiled money. That's all. In that sense I have done so much. Simply by teaching people, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," they are coming to such light. What do you think? I have done most wonderful thing than them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But even if they do not know during their lifetime, at least, towards the end of their life, at the time of death, then they'll remember that, "I have wasted my life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is warned by Śaṅkarācārya. Vivekananda lamented at the end of his life, that "I have simply wasted my life." He admitted, "I have not given anything." <span class="Italic">Bālakānām.</span> He was after this body, and he was recorded, government record, as political <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Yes. He had political purpose, but was acting as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Just like Gandhi, "Saintly statesman." He is recorded, "Saintly statesman." He's a statesman, politician, but he was introducing some morality, non-violence, like that. Actually, his philosophy failed. He wanted Hindu-Muslim unity, but it was divided. The Muslim and Hindu divided. He wanted non-violence. He died out of violence. Therefore all his philosophy failed. And Indian independence was achieved not by Gandhi's non-violence method but (by) Subhas Bose's violence method. And he wanted to explain nonviolence from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just see, another foolishness. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is spoken in the battlefield, and he was screwing some meaning to prove his nonviolence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In one of the articles by Bharatiya... There's a man called Bharatiya, in... What is (indistinct) university? He was saying that Nirana Subhas Bose, he wanted to join Ramakrishna Mission. Is this true, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For future. No. Might be. He wanted to join? Why he should join? Why he did not join?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It was explained that he had a better, great mission, so he should not join, "You should do your..." By that time he was started, fighting for freedom. So he was not allowed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what was that greater mission?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> For independence, fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why he wanted to join Ramakrishna mission? What is the attraction of Ramakrishna mission? What they have done? Ramakrishna mission, what they have done? The Ramakrishna mission is working here in your country... (end)</div>
