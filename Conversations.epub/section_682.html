<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are growing this flowers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śaṅka:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śaṅka:</span> Many, Śrīla Prabhupāda</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. It is very nice flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śaṅka:</span> Also <span class="Italic">campa</span> trees, many <span class="Italic">campa</span> trees, down here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, thank you. Grow such flowers. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (Whispers) Got an umbrella?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are these trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We should bring an umbrella.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These... [break] There is no understanding? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Japan also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Japan also. Well, everyone is against us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, these boys who are recruited newly. They don't have much about the idea of Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's a fact. But what can I do? They are my helper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have to be trained up earlier and then let loose. Otherwise, you know, they create it. Because all the bad impressions are for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They'll be trained while working. Not that simply theorizing at home, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right, but I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should work, and at the same time, they may fall down, just like a child tries to walk, falls down, again walks, again... Then he becomes complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those thirty characteristics of a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> that are depicted in the, in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata....</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible in one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Thirty cannot come, but a few should come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Few that... They are... <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate</span> <span class="Italic">[SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If they have got unflinching faith in Kṛṣṇa and guru, that is all qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all qualification. <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcan sarvair guṇaiḥ.</span> All these qualities are already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But for that you see, he has to withdraw his mind and all the senses from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even he does not withdraw, even it is <span class="Italic">sudurācāra, api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva saḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But then <span class="Italic">bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">ananya-bhāk,</span> they are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Without severing his mind, anywhere he goes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They are fixed up in Kṛṣṇa. That is a fact. That is a fact. You cannot bribe them to take from this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not possible. They may commit some mistake, but they are fixed up in Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span> You cannot deviate them. <span class="Italic">Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this qualification they have, and for this qualification they will be triumphant, without anything else. We shall return now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those thirty qualifications do come naturally, as you say, but they come slowly. But (Hindi) we must teach them this in the <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti,</span> the qualities of a real <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you make a condition that "First of all you become qualified; then you preach," that will never come. Rūpa Gosvāmī therefore recommends, <span class="Italic">yena tena prakāreṇa mana kṛṣṇe niveśayet:</span> "Somehow or other bring him to Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Then other... <span class="Italic">Sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ. Vidhi-niṣedhāḥ. Sarve vidhi-niṣedhā syur etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ.</span> Automatically they'll come as servant. First of all let their mind be fixed up on Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the present difficulties are because they don't know the <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how they can know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we... we are bringing them from which status? Yes. You cannot expect that they will be perfect all of a sudden, overnight. It is not possible. But their mind being fixed up on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is the first qualification. They do not know anything beyond Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In our Vaiṣṇava religions this <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedha</span> is a must right from the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is must. It is must. But you cannot force in the beginning. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they have to be explained of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if they fix up their mind in Kṛṣṇa, the <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedha</span> automatically will come. That process I adopted. When they came to me I never said that "You don't do this, don't do that, don't do that." No. "You simply come here and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." These are... Old students learned. I never said that "You have to follow these rules, these regulations, then you can come..." Because if chanting is properly done, then <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12]</span>-the mind will be cleansed of all dirty things. <span class="Italic">Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathā kṛṣṇa puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ [SB </span>1.2.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply by hearing and chanting, they will be pious. <span class="Italic">Hṛdy antaḥ 'stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti suhṛt satām.</span> Kṛṣṇa is there. As soon as He sees one devotee is sincerely chanting, He'll help, cleansing the heart. <span class="Italic">Vidhunoti</span>... You will read Ajāmila <span class="Italic">upākhyāna</span>. Simply by chanting Nārāyaṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ajāmila got it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Offenseless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All psychological matters, and in the <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga,</span> it is the <span class="Italic">sūkṣma-śarīra</span> which is more important than the <span class="Italic">sthūla.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The behavior of the <span class="Italic">sūkṣma-śarīra</span> is more important than the <span class="Italic">sthūla.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is... The example is given that Ganges water, even it is superficially... There are floating stool and foams...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Dead bodies also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this stool and foam does not pollute the Ganges water. You set it aside and take your dip. That example is given that. External feature does not pollute the soul. <span class="Italic">Asaṅgo 'ya hi puruṣaḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span>... it is simply our <span class="Italic">abhiniveṣa. Abhiniveṣa</span> is dangerous. Otherwise the soul has nothing to do with this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. No, soul is separate from all the three bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Exactly like that: one is on the motorcar. He has nothing to do with the motorcar, but if he thinks, "My car is life. Everything my..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Air is coming into...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">abhiniveṣa</span> gives him trouble. So this <span class="Italic">abhiniveṣa</span> can be removed by increasing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And the Kṛṣṇa consciousness is increased by following the regulative duties. Rise early in the morning, have <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati,</span> this, that, up to ten o'clock. Means <span class="Italic">vidhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is religious <span class="Italic">vidhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So by <span class="Italic">vidhi,</span> he becomes practiced, and....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That becomes a nature then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then it is nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And finally it gives you <span class="Italic">sākṣād-dharma.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All that thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are... The <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedha,</span> if you give up <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedha,</span> then you cannot improve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, the <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedha</span> is a must. Otherwise you are <span class="Italic">daitya</span> sort of a thing, even though you may be practicing anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that they are doing. They are following the regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating. This is the <span class="Italic">niṣedha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I quite understand, sir. But the most important, the climax of the whole thing, is that you see the presence of God everywhere, which is very difficult in the beginning, I understand. But they should be informed that "This is our aim, that Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, and we have a <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of Kṛṣṇa everywhere." Then and then he would not spite another man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they know. This is preliminary. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Not like... Not like the <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājhis:</span> "Kṛṣṇa is everywhere except in the temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have to create a temple within you, then seat Kṛṣṇa there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever it may be, their proposition is "Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, but not in this temple." "Don't go to the temple." That is their proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have theorized that just to oppose Islam. I don't think they meant much about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they have done? Simply hallucination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They believe more in the Vedic scriptures and Vedic injunctions than other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they have meant that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They don't believe in these <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> That is a misfortune for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is a misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only that. They write <span class="Italic">Satya-artha-prakāśa.</span> That means they have understood the real meaning, and all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they are fools. That is their intelligence, <span class="Italic">satya-artha-prakāśa,</span> that so long there was no <span class="Italic">satyārtha</span>; now they have invented <span class="Italic">satyārtha.</span> This is their intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have actually... I mean, through <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> people realize the presence of God everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. In comparison to Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span>... Apart from the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they have done nothing even like me, what to speak of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> I am only a servant and a servant of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> They could not do anything. They admit. Real <span class="Italic">Arya-samājīs,</span> they admit that, that "What was our program, you have executed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In Punjab there was lot of Muslim hierarchy, and that is what they wanted, that... <span class="Italic">Arya-samājīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are not against any "ism," either Muslimism or Christianism. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we never preach against anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was a socio-economic problem or socio-political, not a religious problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, but we never criticize anyone. When the Christians come forward-"Whether our Christian religion can also give the same meaning"-"Yes, why not?" Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It has the same <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I never said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span>ut I think the Christianity is nothing but <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span> It has been preached in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They inquire, "What is your opinion of Jesus Christ?" And "He is our guru."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, that is what it is, what what we take, in fact...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Christians don't know that we take it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if we say "Mohammed," why not? Anyone who has preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness, maybe little differently according to time, circumstances, but anyone who has tried to preach the God consciousness, he is guru. <span class="Italic">Yei kṛṣṇa tattva vettā, sei guru haya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's version. Anyone who preaches about the Supreme Lord, he is guru. Maybe in a different way, according to time, circumstances. The Mohammed also said <span class="Italic">Allah akbar.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Only the difference is that Mohammed is trying to worship <span class="Italic">nirañjana, nirākāra,</span> and we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even Christianity considers His <span class="Italic">ākāra</span>-"God has form."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Mohammed also has got... Caitanya Mahāprabhu argued in Koran. He proved there is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti.</span> He proved with the Pathans. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Otherwise the Christianity is just our way, I mean, absolutely Vaisnavism. It has been wrongly preached and wrongly initiated in India. That is why it has fallen to disrepute. Otherwise Christianity is just <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-dharma.</span> Nothing else, to my mind, the way I have studied, I mean the New Testament and all the Christian, all the things. Now, the sermon of Christ is nothing but the preaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I never criticized. I simply said that positive side, God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Christ himself was drunk with God consciousness totally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Christ himself was drunk with God consciousness <span class="Italic">in toto,</span> absolute.... There cannot be a higher <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> than that. It is said that Jesus Christ learned all these things in India. It might be a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And he daily <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> (?) He came for <span class="Italic">pūjā,</span> for guru. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">devatā bhaktāḥ, te 'pi mām eva kaunteya yajanty avidhi-purvakam.</span> They give examples, as the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> worshiped Kātyāyanī. But that is not <span class="Italic">avidhi.</span> They went to Kātyāyanī for getting the favor of Kṛṣṇa. They prayed to mother Kātyāyanī, "Please be favorable to us so that Kṛṣṇa may be pleased upon us." Others go to beg from Kātyāyanī some material benefits, but the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they did not ask for any material benefit. And therefore that is <span class="Italic">vidhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Gopīs</span>... Those who worship with Kṛṣṇa with sort of a sexual intention, but they became beyond the, I mean, <span class="Italic">guṇas,</span> <span class="Italic">nirguṇa</span> (Hindi), because Kṛṣṇa was <span class="Italic">nirguṇa.</span> That is the thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They became purified. That is simply so they are purified. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then, in ordinary social conditions also, when you have a friend, you become a great lover...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any condition, if you come to Kṛṣṇa, then you become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I know. But what I mean to say, when you have conditioned yourself with Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">guṇas</span> will come to you, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...<span class="Italic">nirguṇa, nirguṇatvam,</span> beyond the three <span class="Italic">guṇas</span> of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a verse in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> <span class="Italic">etad īśanam īśasya.</span> This is the, what is called, <span class="Italic">īśanam,</span> means controlling power, of Kṛṣṇa, that when He comes in this material world, He is not infected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is all the <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava ācāryas'</span> teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">īśanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even though we see Him as an ordinary physical body or a human body, but that is <span class="Italic">divya</span> body, and it is not contaminated by any <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because it is not contaminated, therefore it is not ordinary body. Therefore anyone who thinks of Kṛṣṇa as possessing ordinary body, he is described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> In the ordinary human, this material body, nobody can be controller of the laws of nature. That is not possible. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Unless one has got spiritual body, it is not possible to be unaffected by this material world. Kṛṣṇa never became old although He lived for a 125 years. He never became old. Now, how you can say...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was the controller of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> but we are being controlled by the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, anyway, a 125-years-old and looking like a young man of twenty years old. How it is possible in a material body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So all the <span class="Italic">avatāras</span> of God, they come with a controlling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātma-māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Controlling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā [Bg. 4.6].</span> They do not come under the control of this <span class="Italic">mahāmāyā.</span> They have got their own spiritual potency. <span class="Italic">Āhlādinī-śakti. Ātmanaṁ sṛjāmy aham.</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmanam:</span> Myself, I advent." How it can be like ordinary man? We are... <span class="Italic">karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> We get body. But He says....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And it is by His own free will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, as He likes. He likes to appear as fish, that's all. Not that... Ordinary fish, it is forced to take the body of a fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are controlled by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and its actions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...and take this body for the fulfillment of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He takes the body to fulfill His mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the way. That is real understanding of Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. As soon as the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī</span> thinks that Kṛṣṇa also accepts a material body... Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī</span>. They are called <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī</span> because they think Kṛṣṇa's body is also <span class="Italic">māyā</span>. Therefore they are known as <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He takes birth in <span class="Italic">divya-vigraha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Their story is: "As soon as there is form, it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" They cannot think beyond that in their own terms. Because we have got this form, material body, so their generalization is "As soon as Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, anyone, if He takes this form, then it is material." That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But He takes the form with the control over <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> We take the form under control of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is the controller of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That they do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They don't understand what is <span class="Italic">divya-vigraha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They understand slightly <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda,</span> but they cannot think of that <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That they cannot understand, being less intelligent.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are <span class="Italic">aparādhīs</span> of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They, the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> they are offender to Kṛṣṇa; therefore they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> In other places it is said, <span class="Italic">aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.</span> Their intelligence is still unclean. <span class="Italic">Vimukta-māninaḥ.</span> They are thinking that they have become liberated, <span class="Italic">māninaḥ,</span> imposition, but actually</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.</span> Their intelligence is not yet clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Clouded, cloudy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Clouded, yes. <span class="Italic">Aviśuddha.</span> Therefore confirms this. Because the <span class="Italic">aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ,</span> it takes many, many lives to purify it. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When they come to the purified stage, then they surrender <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabha [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> They... [break] ...to be <span class="Italic">aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ</span> unless they come to the point of surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. And we are unintelligent persons. We do it immediately. Let us do it immediately. Why we shall wait for many, many births?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is not that, sir. I think complete surrendering of our ego at the sacred feet of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and they cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but they cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they are egoistic toward the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only that. They think they are very intelligent, overintelligent. They do not take advice of Kṛṣṇa. They are so intelligent that Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">,</span> and still they will stick to their <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> yoga, <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Kṛṣṇa clearly says that "You cannot understand Me by this process." <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś </span><i class="calibre3">cāsmi </i>:<span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.55] "If you want to know Me in truth, then <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Nothing else." And still, they will stick to those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but I think they have not understood even Śaṅkarācārya. Śaṅkarācārya has composed <span class="Italic">stotras</span> on Viṣṇu and... <span class="Italic">Bhaja govindam, bhaja govinda, govindaṁ bhaja mūḍha-mate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have become more than Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have seen the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like later on, the Gandhi's disciples became more than Gandhi, more than Gandhi. That's all. Gandhi planned village organization, and Jawaharlal Nehru planned industrialization. And everything failed. There is no money, and he wanted to establish industry like America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he did not understand economics, sir. What is money after all? Money is nothing but the labor transformed into materials. We had the huge labor of sixty crores of people. He was capable of transforming that labor into material unfortunately and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, they changed the Gandhi's program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what Gandhi understood, but he did not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he can understand? He wanted to utilize to become prime minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Internationally that happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Now the village program of Gandhi is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Absolutely. But whatever he has got, he had a lot of <span class="Italic">vidhi-niṣedha</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it is lost because it was not God-centered. It is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he was God conscious. I mean, I have been brought up in that camp. Gandhi was a saint. But these people could not follow him. They have not understood him well. Those people who understood him, they died out. They died out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, now, Gandhi's <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> was there any temple for worshiping Kṛṣṇa? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They had a temple. My wife was brought up there in the <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the morning they had to say prayer to Deva. (?) <span class="Italic">Gītā-mandir</span> they had. They had all the characteristics of a good saint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not from the beginning? No, no, no. Gandhi did not believe in Kṛṣṇa. No, yes, he has written, that "I know..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not that the way we believe, but he did believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That means he is right and we are wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We may be right. We may be right. Who knows? Many ways may be right. It is not only that one way be right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how we understand who is right and who is wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There cannot be only one way. There are many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the defect. Therefore we present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, no other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Gandhi was a politician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was not a politician. He was more a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> than a politician. He fell in politics. He was a saintly man turned into a politician. He was more a saintly man than a politician. He failed in politics. I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he was studied by the governor of Bengal that "Either Gandhi is a saintly man amongst the politicians or he is a politician among the saintly persons." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These people have not been able to understand Gandhi's intentions. It is the misfortune of this country they have not been able to carry out his message. Other people are able to carry out his messages. Other people of the world are able to understand him well, but we people are fools not to understand him. No. His socio-economic condition..., I mean, program. His program for lifting the society... You are religious head. He was a sort of a, another man, but in his own spirit he was doing a good work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our proposition is that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins to distinguish the soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> From the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the body. But Gandhi has never said anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was always, you know, <span class="Italic">anāsakta-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is all right, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He always used to, daily, twice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the beginning this is the... You can have any yoga, <span class="Italic">anāsakti</span> or <span class="Italic">āsakti,</span> but the primary instruction is one has to understand first of all this, that one is not this body. And the national movement is based on this bodily concept of life. "I am Indian."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All the national... All the world's on that body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is the difference. First of all one has to understand that he is neither Indian nor American nor English. But if you go on pushing on national movement, where is the chance of understanding that you are not this body? Just like our movement, we never say anything national. We simply state that "You are not this body. You are spirit soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gandhiji, when he went to one first round table conference in London, and he had to confront those women, I mean the wives of the workers of the Manchester mills, he said that "We are poor." They say, "We are poor. We are suffering for the poor of India." Then he had to give this argument that "Poors of India are much poorer than what you are." So he is trying to..., I mean, take a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is bodily concept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he was in politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Poor or rich, that is due to this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In politics you have got to be body conscious. Politics or war is the same thing, after all. Your sphere is much different, sir, than those. And we cannot compare them with you or you with them. You are a, I mean, out and out a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> and a saint. He was a politician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I am talking about the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All right, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Whatever little we understand, we preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that the first principle of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is to understand that "I am not this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gandhiji's program was to emancipate the poor, downtrodden people of India in whatever way... In that way, in which there is no implication of falsehood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it may not be falsehood, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It will be by the right way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This may not be the right way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> May not be or wrong way, we do not know. But then he did. According to him, he brought and he tried, and he struggled...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we simply study that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins with this education, that "You are not this body." Yes. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]. Asmin dehe, dehi.</span> It has nothing to do with this <span class="Italic">kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> This is to be understood. The whole world requires to understand this verse; otherwise they remain <span class="Italic">go-khara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is right, sir. That has been explained from time immemorial, but the world does not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why not? These people are understanding. These all Kṛṣṇa conscious students, they are understanding. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These type of students were eternally there with all the religious teaching, past and present. But unfortunately...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So those who were there, they understood. They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Unfortunate for the world it is not going to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there was no preaching. That's it. Now the preaching is going on. They are understanding. Nobody preached this. If you... Just like a big building. If the foundation is wrong, then it will not stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has got everything, all aspects of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is the beginning of teaching, that "You are not this body." If you remain in the false understanding that "I am this body," "I am Indian," "I am Englishman," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," there is no spiritual education. <span class="Italic">Mohita.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">mohita. Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair, mohitaṁ nābhijānāti.</span> He remains in ignorance. (aside:) (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kali-yuga, it is excessive, but this is going on. Even... Maybe in Satya-yuga it was less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Maybe nothing, perhaps, the first Satya-yuga. People were all saints.</div>
