<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> His last questions are like this. He's asking about proselytizing in the Western countries, preaching. Is there any hope for preaching? He says Hindi <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> like this. I think everything is arising because of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement and your Divine Grace's preaching work. Otherwise, they were all sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ten years ago if they'd have asked these questions before you came to the West, they wouldn't even have thought about going to the West. They are only asking that now because they can see in the last ten years we've been so much successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> what is Vedānta. They do not know. Simply aspiring, all after women and money, that's all. First-class rogues. I know all of them, all first-class rogues, after money and women. Beginning from Vivekananda. But they are so popular, if you say openly... <span class="Italic">Satyam bruhet ma bruhet satyam apriyam(?).</span> "You can speak truth, but don't speak which is unpalatable." But we speak in a different way. And directly we don't speak. People will be angry. They're already fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of the others are trying to make some compromise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also bad. How we can make compromise? Here is gold, here is iron, how you can compromise? Can we accept iron as gold? All right, let us accept. (laughs) Where is the possibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They don't see that clearly. They are looking at their iron and thinking it's gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are seeing... They're tested. I don't make any compromise. All my speaking is also no compromise. Here is guru, here is Kṛṣṇa, here is God, here is Vedānta. Real version they neglect, and they stick to the rascal's version, Śaṅkara's version, <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya.</span> All over India, they are reading <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rāmānujācārya is very well known in India, so why don't they read his commentary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They hate Rāmānujācārya because he's Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because he doesn't allow them to speculate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very strict. He is a stubborn enemy of Śaṅkarācārya. All the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, declare it: <span class="Italic">māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you hear the interpretation of <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> then you are doomed. You have no hope for spiritual advancement. This is the statement. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa.</span> Finished, your spiritual life is finished. You can write this also, that Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction is strictly to avoid the so-called Vedantists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All these impersonalists, they always represent themselves as being big Vedantists. They don't know anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people, leaders of India, they are thinking, "Where is this Vedantist?" In foreign countries, what is their position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Somehow or other, they seem to think that the Vedānta is something better than any of the other <span class="Italic">śāstra. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> doesn't seem to be so popular in India as Vedānta or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very popular amongst the Māyāvāda people. You speak also... Now the so-called Vedantists they are speaking on <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> distorting. Akhoyananda, Akandananda, Karpatri(?), the rascals. Because they have no subject matter to speak, they are distorting the meaning of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> This boy appears to be nice, this fat boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Kīrtanānanda said he's the only local boy who has taken interest. He's from hereabouts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that "I've wanted to see you since a long time." So, keep friendship with... Giving them <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kīrtanānanda Swami cut up some watermelon, and we distributed it to the guests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, shall I lock this up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. (end)</div>
