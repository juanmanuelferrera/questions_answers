<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole world is becoming CIA. (laughter) We can say, that "All right, the Americans have sent their CIA, but why the Germans business there? They are also CIA?" And where is... Soon the Russians also will join, the Polish also will join, everyone will join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Africans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They can't say the Russians are CIA. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We have got potency to force everyone to join. The Russians have already imperceptibly joined-they have praised my books. That is imperceptible, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ajñāta-sukṛti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. In East Germany also, they have placed order. So this is joining. Just like for us, if you bring any other literature, we throw it away immediately. We take it as useless. Actually it is. We have nothing to learn from them, anything. All bogus. Either he's scientist or astronomer, or..., we know they are talking all bogus things. There may be some truth. Even that truth is there when a child speaks, there is some truth. When a child speaks to his parents, there is some truth, otherwise where is the question of talking? So little portion truth is there, everywhere. But when they talk of big, big things-they are going to Mars and scratching sand there-that we don't believe. That we don't believe. When they talk of this tape recorder, some electronic machine, joining together and it is working, that much care you can take. But when you speak of so many things, that millions of years there were germs and germination, now they are trying to come out, and it is all vacant-these are all bogus, we don't accept. Talking too much. In Bengal it is called <span class="Italic">yatap</span>(?) When the same child speaks something too much, "Ah, stop." To the extent of his capacity, that's all right. But if you talk more than that, then you are rascal. So they are doing that now. Because they have got some electronic success, or they have manufactured some jet plane, or these, they are now thinking "Now we have owned over the whole world situation." That is nonsense. They are thinking like that: "Now we have control over the world world." That is <span class="Italic">yatam,(?)</span> speaking more than their capacity. And so far we are concerned, we don't talk anything, except what is mentioned in the books. That's all. We remain always foolish. And as foolish men, we do not talk. We simply talk what is mentioned by Vyāsadeva, by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. That's all. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu...</span> These things have been discussed in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> by Prahlāda Mahārāja, that in the material world, the only pleasure is sex. There is no pleasure. Always working hard like asses, that's all, everyone. Not only in one. Life after life, life after life. This is material. And... (children outside yelling) So why they are here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I'll tell them... (to devotee outside) Those children out there, their terrible screaming's disturbing Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They're all the way down the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Get them all off the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the trap of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> to keep them captivated by sex attraction. All these living entities who are in this material world, beginning from the higher planetary system down to the ants and germs and flies. This is the primary enjoyment, sex. The central attraction is sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> The human being, the same sex desire, they decorate it in a different way. But the central point is the same. "So all right, why? It is enjoyment, why you are forbidding?" Saintly persons say, <span class="Italic">yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span> It is a pleasure of itching sensation. Itching sensation, when you itch, it is very pleasing. But <span class="Italic">bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Aftereffect is very bad, suffering. Itching, if you itch more, it aggravates, sometimes causes so many other by-products and so on, so on. That is fact. But everyone knows it, that "I may enjoy sex pleasure now; the aftereffect will be very bad." <span class="Italic">Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> But why people do it again and again? <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa-kṛpaṇa</span> means not <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>-those who are not trained up as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> they cannot tolerate this itching sensation. They become victimized and the aftereffect is very, very bad. So either illicit or not illicit... They know it. The modern civilization, they have adopted the means of killing. First of all, they try to stop pregnancy by contraceptive method, and still if it is not stopped, then kill. And if he's still born, then again they put up in a box and go away. You know this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, the baby, they put it in a closet and lock the door and walk out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, in Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is happening in Japan and other places. They put, and when the obnoxious smell comes, they open it and they find. Mother has become so kind. They put in a box and lock it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Airport lockers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are happening. But when you talk of that "You learn how to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span>" that they will refuse. This is the position. The aftereffect is very, very bad, either you get legally or illegally. Legally, we have to raise the children very nicely. Otherwise, they will, unwanted children, create so much trouble. You have to take care for their proper education, of their clothes.(?) We say, "Never mind, you have got children, give them proper education, make them devotees, make their life successful." We cannot say that "You kill them." That we cannot say. That is not possible. Neither we can pack them in the, what is that box?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Lockers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is not possible for us. We welcome. But we must be well organized to utilize these poor souls for becoming first-class devotees. That should be done. Otherwise, sex life and the by-product, that is always troublesome, either you take this way or that way, it is troublesome. If it is not troublesome, why they are killing their own children? To avoid trouble. This is psychology. They want to avoid trouble. But our process is, if you want to avoid trouble, then don't marry, remain <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> If you cannot, then, all right, have legal wife, get children and raise them very nicely, make them Vaiṣṇavas, take the responsibility. So we are organizing this society, we welcome. Some way or other we shall arrange for shelter. But to take care of the children, to educate them, that will depend on their parents. Now our Pradyumna was complaining that in the <span class="Italic">Gurukula,</span> his child was not educated to count one, two, three, four. So I have told him that "You educate your child. Let the mother educate in English, and you educate him in Sanskrit." Who can take care? So similarly every father, mother should take care that in future they may not be a batch of unwanted children. We can welcome hundreds and thousands of children. There is no question of economic problem. We know that. But the father, mother must take care at least. Properly trained up, they should be always engaged. That is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī gurukula. Brahmacārī guru-kule vasan dānto guror hitam [SB </span>7.12.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> From the very beginning they should be trained up. From the body, they should be trained up how to take bath, how to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa or some Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> go to the temple, offer obeisances, prayer, then take their lunch... In this way, they should be always engaged. Then they'll be trained up. Simple thing. We don't want to train them as big grammarians. No. That is not wanted. That anyone, if he has got some inclination, he can do it personally. There is no harm. General training is that he must be a devotee, a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That should be introduced. Otherwise, the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> will be... Otherwise Jyotirmayī was suggesting the biology. What they'll do with biology? Don't introduce unnecessary nonsense things. Simple life. Simply to understand Kṛṣṇa. Simply let them be convinced that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is our duty to serve Him, that's all. Huh? (indistinct) What is that? <span class="Italic">māyār bośe, jāccho bhese' Khāccho hābuḍubu bhāi jīv kṛṣṇa-dās ei biśwās korle to ār duḥkho nāi.</span> So organize. If you have got sufficient place, sufficient scope, let them be trained up very nicely. If some four, five centers like this there are in Europe, the whole face will be changed. Important places like Germany, France, England. Now we are getting place. I like that place, German, on account of this. It has got scope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's no land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can acquire, that you can acquire. But building is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We don't own that place, though, do we?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind, own or not own. You possess and that's all. You don't own anything. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Do you think it is, you own this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, I was thinking in terms of ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is all Kṛṣṇa's property. So long He likes, we shall remain. That's all. I know that. (laughs) Just like we entered Bhaktivedanta Manor without any arrangement. I know that so long Kṛṣṇa will like, we shall... If Kṛṣṇa says "Go away," we shall go away, what is that? Why so much legal implication? Everywhere, although we have got big, big buildings, I don't think we own it. It is Kṛṣṇa's. So long He likes, we shall remain there, if He doesn't like, we shall go away. What is this? Why you should stress on the proprietorship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, I was just thinking in terms of the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not proprietor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Would you like that tomatoes and cucumber and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, bring. <span class="Italic">Mānasa deho geho jo kichu mor arpiluṅ tuwā pade nanda-kiśora.</span> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. "Whatever I have got, it is all Yours." <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyasya saṅkalpa.</span> Whatever is favorable, take it, that's all. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇa-anuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā.</span> This is? What is that, apple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Apple, cucumber. The apples are not fresh, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from the tree, because those apples you saw yesterday were just for cooking. They're very sour...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They have eating apples. We have eating apples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're sour, too sour. Just for cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That's fresh cucumber? And our tomato?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're a little warm because they've been in the sun all day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The peas were good last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good, but I could not digest them. That is my fault, but, oh, it was so nice palatable. Chick peas, chick peas, grow fresh. Eat very nicely, keep strong, drink milk, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> Don't depend on this outside work and then gradually become debauch, thief, rogues, prostitutes. Is that civilization? They cannot imagine that the modern civilization can go without all these things. Do they not? Slaughterhouse, brothel, cheating, diplomacy, roguery, drinking-without this, no civilization. We are quite opposed. We want to show it is possible, yes. You can stop all this nonsense and still you go on as a perfect civilized man. With character, knowledge, satisfaction, everything. They are trying to gather knowledge by sending so many machines up to date. We have already got. We say you cannot go there, you are simply wasting your time. We have got so much knowledge. No, you can attempt, just like a monkey, that's all right. But our verdict is already there. You cannot go there. Ten years before I said this moon excursion is simply childish and waste of money in my <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets.</span> I am not a scientist, but how I dared to say? Because I know, I have got full knowledge. That is the difference. Without becoming scientist, we can give our verdict. <span class="Italic">Veda-pramāṇam.</span> (Prabhupāda is eating) Umm, better give this fresh fruit. Don't bring all rotten. In the market you cannot get fresh. All three hundred years old. Anything fresh, that is full of vitamin. Grow fresh, take fresh. In India there is no system to purchase three-hundred-years-old bread and eat. It must be freshly made. Wife is preparing in the simple oven, husband is eating, children are eating. You know Yaśodāmāyī calling Kṛṣṇa? "Come back! Your father is waiting!" You remember this? That is Indian system. The father and the children, they sit down, mother will bring fresh <span class="Italic">dāl,</span> rice and <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi,</span> and distribute, and they eat. We used to do that. Along with father we shall sit down for eating, separately. There was no need of table-on the ground. And mother will distribute, cook. No servant; mother personally, wife personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book you describe that in Kṛṣṇa's palace there were so many beautiful maidservants, but Rukmiṇī chose to fan Kṛṣṇa personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Still, in Indian family system, when the husband comes from office, the wife takes care immediately. Even in these days. That is, at least, a manifestation of faithfulness. (aside) No, don't bother. This has fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Requires some steps or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You go on walk tonight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They can fix all your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Someone can come in whilst we're gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The cucumber cutting, there is a process. I'll show you. Sometimes cucumber is bitter. By that process it can be avoided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You mean chop the top and you go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is bitter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We tasted one piece. Yes, little bitter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> When they work in the fields, we have speakers all over the land, and they hear you chanting all day long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. This should be arranged with lemon juice. If you have got these fruits, there is no need of purchasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The tomatoes are supposed to be as good as oranges. The tomatoes are supposed to be as healthy as oranges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In our childhood, these tomatoes were called foreign eggplant, <span class="Italic">bilāti beguna</span>. And because it was foreign, nobody will touch it. In our childhood we'd never eat the tomato. It was rejected by whole Indian Hindu culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Tomatoes don't grow in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It was imported. Because it was imported they would not touch. The mill cloth, because they were imported, no gentleman will touch. No religious function would allow to use mill-made cloth. And so far medicine is concerned, they would never touch it. This is the difficulty... (indistinct) sent a confidential report that if you want to keep Indians as Indian you'll never be able to do like that. Then they will gradually introduce all this nonsense, drinking tea, drinking wine. "You are uncivilized. Whatever British are doing, they are civilized way. England's work in India." And they were given facilities, those who were English educated. In this way, they first of all tried to make the whole Indian population Anglici... Not possible to all. At least, those who are educated. So the so-called Indian educated, they took it seriously. Just like our Bon Mahārāja. English way of living, with fork and... Yes. He has taken it seriously. He is under impression, whatever is foreign. In this way Indian culture was killed. The Muhammadans, they had no such idea. They wanted to rule over, that's all. And the money was not going to outside They were spending lavishly-in India. The money was in India, but these people, they're dispersing all the money, jewels, and everything valuable, outside India. So they became poverty-stricken. And culturally conquered. (aside) Not so many. This will be enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> One time you said that they criticized you when you were going to America because you did not know about the knife and the fork?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bon Mahārāja. And the book <span class="Italic">English Etiquette.</span> Very big book. How to sit, how to laugh, how to smile, how to pass water, how to this... (laughter) And they would learn it and waste time. (pause) So, if you grow more, and offer fruits to the Deity in the evening, and this will be very nice. You can distribute that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Would you like to go for a walk soon? I'll get everything ready. The palanquin was nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, everything is nice. In the morning also you give me fresh fruit and that milk and medicine, that's all. And when I'm (indistinct), someday we can take <span class="Italic">puri</span> and... (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...any expert in your country who can fry foodgrains in hot sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Like they make puffed rice, I think, like that. I don't think so. They do it by machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Puffed rice? How? What is that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> When they make a thatcher, they use some kind of machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we can do it very easily. Sand should be very hot. You can make hot sand, it is not difficult. Any fire. And then take the grains in some, another pot, and put the hot sands under it and then agitate. And it will <span class="Italic">puff-puff-puff-puff-puff-puff,</span> they'll be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Put the hot sand where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sand is being heated in fire, so you put the grains in another pot and put the hot sand there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Underneath the pot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why underneath? I said another pot. You are so dull brain. Here is hot sand. I bring in another pot, the grains, and the hot sand I pour on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pour on it, on top of the grains. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And then agitate and then put the whole thing on a mesh and make it like this, again put the hot sand there. Is it clear? Then you get the puffed-up grains. That is very good food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Devotees make popcorn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That's another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Popcorn, they fry it in <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> hot <span class="Italic">ghee.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not much though, just a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I've seen it. They do it. But that is not very digestive. If you make this sand, hot sand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very light. In the morning you can give them this puffed grains, then fruits and milk, very good breakfast. I mean to say all self-dependent. Yes. We should save time, as much for this purpose, for chanting, discussing <span class="Italic">grantha.</span> Not for any personal so-called comforts. We can sit down anywhere on the grass here, and whatever available we make our food. This is the idea. Life will be sublime. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.</span> That is real business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are spending so much money for entertainment in material life, but no one is becoming enlivened. But this kind of discussion is so fresh. For a show they pay five dollars, to go to one movie for one hour, two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another artificial agitation of the mind. It has, there is no practical benefit. Just see how many varieties of flowers, colorful. Can they make such colorful? "Yes, we're trying to overcome nature. Wait millions of years." And what about not? "Now you sleep." (laughter) These rascals are misleading other rascals. And they are, "Oh, a scientist!" Very misleading civilization. We shall appreciate in every flower the craftsmanship of Kṛṣṇa, how He has done nicely. Unnecessarily puffed up by so-called advancement of knowledge, misleading themselves and misleading others. Who is that old man comes? Some old man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He's a life member from Belgium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He has come from Belgium? In the last German war, the first attempt of attack was on Belgium. And within few hours, Belgium finished, conquered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's a very nice part of the day. It's warm, nice part of the day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this part is better situated than New Vrindaban, eh? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is a lot nicer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New Vrindaban is on the rocks and hills, and this is plain. Therefore situation is better. That New Orleans is also plain land. You have been there? And Pennsylvania is also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pennsylvania is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it doesn't matter. Our purpose will be served anywhere. So, try to concentrate in this village organization life. Full of anxieties, city life. The houses already there, if you repair them nicely then it is a very nice place. They're gradually being repaired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. No one is getting any salary here, they are just working and taking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all. Why salary? Kṛṣṇa's servant. We are eternal servant. That is the beauty of our institution. We have no hired men. Unless one is sincere, why he'll work? What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Eight-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think it is stopped. Just see how beautifully it is colored. This sense, aesthetic sense. Kṛṣṇa knows how it will become beautiful. <span class="Italic">Svā-bhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.</span> Construction-eh?-of the flower. And there is no intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So beat them with shoes and when they protest, "Oh, it is chance, don't mind. It is by chance I am beating." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It seems they are struggling so hard for existence they do not have time to contemplate these simple things, working so hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So show the simple example that how by simple living and thinking of Kṛṣṇa, one can become perfect and happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> People's minds are so much agitated by false desire that they can't appreciate anything. Real beauty they overlook, searching for something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My mother used to make puffed rice at home. So there is special rice available for making puffed rice. Either you can prepare at home or you can purchase in the market, special rice. So she was preparing nice puffed rice, very, very nice. In a sand pot. My mother was always engaged in making some food preparation. Some pickle, some chutney, and this puffed rice, or something else, something else, something else. Besides cooking for the family, she was being assisted by my sisters. Always palatable foodstuff. So many guests were there, and if son-in-law would come, they would specially prepare food for him. To receive guests, give them nice food to eat, prepare nice food for the family, this is the Indian pleasure. They are not very much, nowadays, for upkeep of the home, very... That, in their own way, they keep it very nicely. Every utensils, very cleansed, they are kept ready for use, some cloth. If you go in a poor man's home, but you'll find everything very neat and clean. Ask these <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> to keep their home very neat and clean. Are they keeping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are the general program for eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> For eating? Every morning everyone has a nice glass of yogurt, chickpeas and apple, orange and banana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chickpeas fried?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Boiled, chick peas. And apple, orange and banana. And in the afternoon they have rice, <span class="Italic">dāl, cāpāṭi,</span> and salad, and in the evening they have a glass of milk and a little bread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. What is that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One of the vans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vans. (child crying outside) "Prabhupāda?" (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We brought the Jagannātha Deity here from Paris for Ratha-yātrā, and He stayed here for eight days and then went back. And when He went back all the Gurukula children, they were all crying and running after the truck.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā</span> (laughs). So... It is natural affection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The little boys also, they were crying, little girls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Ratha-yātrā was functioned here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, yes, very big, two hundred devotees here. It was very ecstatic. Nice <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> and nice procession. When He came, all the cows came up and they were looking. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The villagers joined?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are finding something new</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">Times of India</span> gave a very good report of New York Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's in the room, I thought you'd seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They cannot publish anything bad about us. They try to find, sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seems they're always carrying little snippets of information about what we're doing. Before there was a report about the restaurants, and here there's two reports about..., one about the Jagannātha festival in New York and one about the proposed Vedic university in Kurukṣetra. These were on consecutive days. The one about New York, it says, "Washington, July the 19th." That's where it's reported from. It says, "New York saw on Sunday an unusual spectacle of three brightly colored chariots being pulled along the city's prestigious Fifth Avenue from Central Park to Washington Square, a distance of about five kilometers, by members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa group. The <span class="Italic">rathas,</span> built in Orissan style with giant wooden wheels, attracted large crowds of spectators all along the route. It was a novel experience for the New Yorkers. Many resident Indians who are not members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement enthusiastically gave a hand in the pulling. The Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees were celebrating the feast of Jagannātha in the traditional Indian way. The police and the city administration readily cooperated. In a city that is coming to be known for its tolerance of diverse cultures, chariot processions promise to be an annual event. While a few citizens booed and some altercations were reported, the spectacle was well received by the New Yorkers. 'I think it is great,' the <span class="Italic">New York Times</span> quoted a man as saying. The person, who identified himself as a visitor to New York and was not a Hare Kṛṣṇa fan, referring to the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, added, 'They are all happy and dancing, and that's what life's all about.' Later a vegetarian feast was served to the admirers."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very good. There's just a real short one about the university in Kurukṣetra. It says, "Vedic Varsity for Kurukṣetra Soon." "The first Vedic university will come up soon at Kurukṣetra and will be affiliated to V.M. Cakravarty University. The proposed university is being set up by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, ISKCON, and will cost rupees two <span class="Italic">crore.</span> Most of the funds will be provided by Mr. Alfred Ford, the nephew of the auto magnate Henry Ford. Mr. Ford, on becoming a disciple of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder of ISKCON, changed his name to Ambarīṣa dāsa. The Vedic university will offer courses leading to <span class="Italic">bhakti-śāstrī </span>and <span class="Italic">sarvabhauma.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...new devotees joining?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The garden crew, when they go out in the afternoon, they have <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> out to the fields with <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> and <span class="Italic">karatālas</span> where they work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to arrange for little more water so you can... The pump is not in order. You can arrange for that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This, in July, this is normal weather now, in August and July. But generally in July it has some rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This year...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. And it was the hottest weather in a hundred years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It was, in July. Extremely hot. And actually our well was one of the only ones functioning in the whole area, and we were watering the crops and everything. Our corn is very nice, very high, and our tomatoes are very good. The barley harvest was five tons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five times more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Five tons of barley we got, from our harvest. It was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Did you get some barley flour?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't have any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) We can't make, it's not finely ground enough. We can't make it into <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis.</span> It's just too coarse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You could do one thing. You just smash that and boil with milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You mean a mortar and pestle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Smash and boil with milk. Don't put sugar. Then I shall put sugar according to my taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want that this evening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. Tomorrow morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We are the only farm in the whole area that is growing chick peas. The man said he did not think they can grow. But we have a whole field of chick peas. They'll be coming up ripe for harvest in about three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chick peas very nutritious. If you simply boil soft, oh, it is very nutritious. A little, so much, is as good as full meal. Next time, if possible, I shall come in June-June, July, August.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, these are nice months, best months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not difficult. To come to Paris it takes eight or nine hours from Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But you might already be in America at that time. (laughs) You're always in America at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now this place is very nice. The outside, so pleasing, the outdoors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I think you are feeling a little better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, little. This facility is nowhere in America, outdoors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, we have one or two places that are just developing, like Miami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have a nice program on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> where at least twice a week they go to a house and give a class at someone's home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Wherever they are. They meet some interested person and they go and they have a class in their home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he invites friends.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And one man, after the devotee was there, the next week he sent two thousand dollars in the mail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And then he came to the Paris temple and he gave another thousand dollars. And then two weeks later he sent again two thousand dollars, and then he moved in with his whole family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> (laughs)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> South of France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If we had a big farm in the south it would be very nice. In the south of France the weather is always very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> South of France is near Mediterranean. Marseilles is south?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Marseilles is right on the Mediterranean. We have very big <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Of all the different groups in this country, we have the best reputation. They hardly ever write any bad thing about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> French people are, I think, cultured than other states.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They like to read. When they distribute the hard-cover books door to door, many people always look at the binding, how the book is made, and they like the pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our own <span class="Italic">mung dāl</span>?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Not yet harvested. But the plants are all very healthy, strong.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> When we installed the Gaura-Nitāi Deity last January, many villagers came, and they all came, they were touching the floor, they have never seen such a nice floor, how smooth it was. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such marble floor they never saw. (pause) [break] ...who has paid you more than five thousand dollars and he has joined, that does not mean that he's a foolish man. He's a businessman. So what about his business? Leased to somebody else? He leased out to somebody else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He's finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, stopped that business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. He's full time here. He had plumbing business, so he does all the plumbing here. And he meets all the officials, the police, and they like him. He is older man. He has a very nice way of presenting himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's been here over a year now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Several months ago we had a parents' meeting. Because on account of this man Moon, there was much agitation about groups taking young children away. So we had a very nice meeting with <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and slides, and one of the parents was saying that "We want to be angry at you, but the problem is that you are all so nice that we cannot be angry."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One gentleman has joined, he has paid five thousand dollars. His whole family has joined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Just now? That's nice.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I wanted to get <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book published while you are here. So I really pushed our printer to work very hard. I told him, "But the thing is, I have no money to pay you right now," because we had just printed <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> He said, "You try to give me five percent down and I'll give you eight months' credit."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So I didn't have the money because we were fixing up. So one girl joined, and she gave eight thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is the whole bill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That was..., the whole bill was about forty-five thousand dollars. So that was sufficient for the downpayment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is about more than ten percent. He wants five percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> But I gave him. (end)</div>
