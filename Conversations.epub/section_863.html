<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> While I was in New York, I've been going to the United Nations building there, and there's a organization called ECOSOC, the Economic and Social Council. It's made up of the members of the U.N. and I think there's very good chance that our society can be represented amongst this group as a nongovernmental organization, which means that in various matters which the council discusses, we would be a consultive group and we would be able to present statements as well as literature on how to solve..., on our viewpoint on how to solve various problems facing the council. And these would be distributed to all the United Nations representatives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you say "God," they will reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, actually, one of the things which this council handles is freedom of religion throughout the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they do not believe in God. Freedom of religion means whatever you like, you do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on. Religion is not very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. It's not one of their major considerations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, that is their consideration. Animal activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But one advantage of this is that all of the.... Just like they make a lot of studies of various countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Studies" means if they do not take the science of God as the most important items. Then they'll say: "Yes, you have freedom, you can do. I have got my freedom."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. They make a lot of information available on the.... In other words, it'll help our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement because they make inquiries into the freedom of an individual, for example, to.... As we want to distribute literature in various countries, they have so much facts and figures on where that would be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the newsreel will say that this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement is nuisance, it is disturbance. Then what they'll do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There's also some respectability if we become connected with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's prestigious, and it also allows us to have a lot of information available. Just like, as we're finding out, for example, Rāmeśvara Mahārāja is working with our lawyer here, and we find that we have the legal right to distribute in airports. Legally, we have the right. Similarly, there are legal rights for our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement in various countries in the world, and through this group we would get access to all information on what the legal position is and other things of this kind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Yes, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (Maharishi Mahesh) Yogi, he tried to file a trademark on the words "Transcendental Meditation" with the United States government. So we protested that actually he cannot claim that he is teaching transcendental meditation, what to speak of prohibiting anyone else from using those words. So they accepted our claim and kicked out his application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They were writing, their lawyers were writing our Society letters that "You cannot use the words 'Transcendental Meditation.' Maharishi has made up this process and you are stealing from him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's stealing from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Yesterday you gave an example of a man who was lying asleep in bed, and he is transported somewhere in dream, walking on the beach. What is the full...? Because we're going to try to make an exhibit of it. So what is the full analogy? Is he actually going to another place by his mind, he's actually transported?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The soul is going there. The seer is the same in this gross body or in the subtle bodies. I am in the, walking in this gross body, I'm seeing this ocean, and I will leave my gross body in dream, I go to India. So the seer is the same. That is the proof of transmigration. He's dreaming tiger, and he's crying, "Here is a tiger, tiger, tiger," and another man, who is seer of the body, he says, "Where is tiger?" So this is the difference. One is seeing through this gross body, another seeing through the subtle body, but the seer is the same. Transmigration of the soul means, when he's seeing through.... That is practical. The child, when he's seeing through the childish body, he's talking nonsense. The same soul, when he's talking as an elderly person, he's talking beautiful (indistinct). The seer is the same, simply the glass is changed. Sometimes blue, sometimes red. [break] Seer is the same, medium is different. That you have.... And dead body means the seer is no longer there. It has entered another body. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> ...when someone is sleeping and dreaming, that the seer has left the gross body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> How does the.... Life symptoms, how are the life symptoms maintained in the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> The life symptoms are maintained in the body still?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, life symptoms, there is not. The body's fit; therefore, he comes back again. When the body is not fit, he enters another body. Just like your car you leave. We have come here. Now the car is all right; we go. If it is useless, we don't go. We take another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> The body is breathing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That is like leaving the motor running.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They, unless the seer returns back, the body will lie down. That is death. The seer no more comes back. Then it is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, sometimes a man dies in his sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So sleeping is like temporary death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All deaths are temporary. When you change bodies, you die for seven months. This death is for few hours, and that is for seven months. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> What happens when he dreams of the spiritual master or Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Dreaming means he's seeing. The seer is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In Hawaii you were saying that they take rest for six months and wake up a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter) [break] ...a small garden like this, that is called a hanging garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we can walk there in the mornings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is considered to be the watering process, and sometimes from chanting, the weeds, from watering, the weeds also grow along with devotional service-the weeds of different desires. I don't understand how it is possible that from chanting that these weeds grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting is purifying all material desires. It will take, gradually. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> If you are chanting without any offense, then your heart will be cleansed of all material contamination. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> So pulling out the weeds means avoiding the offenses in chanting the holy name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So long we'll have material desires, we'll have to accept a material body and fulfill the desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Sometimes, although a devotee understands that he must take birth again if he does not, if he is not strict, he thinks, "Oh, it is so difficult to be strict. Maybe I'll just take it easy and remain engaged in devotional service, then I'll take another birth as a devotee and maybe next time I'll finish up my business."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He gets good opportunity of material enjoyment, and then take birth in good family, aristocratic or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then where he ended in last life, he begins again. There is a verse: <span class="Italic">paurva-dehikam. Paurva-dehikam</span> means previous birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> It seems, though, that in that respect, he's gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gambling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Yes, he's gambling, that he's thinking that "Oh, next life I will come back in a better condition," but his next might be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should he desire like that? That means he has not understood what is meant by Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. One who understands wants to get out in this lifetime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One who understands Kṛṣṇa consciousness should want to finish the business of material life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore he's required to read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> thoroughly. It is said clearly, "This is a place of misery." Why do you desire to keep yourself in this.... That means you do not understand what is spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Still thinking he's this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thinking. Thinking, he's under the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā. māyā</span> is dictating, "Why you are trying to go away? Come on, here, Santa Monica." (laughter) And when you become detestful either this Santa Monica or any Monica, "I am not interested," then your spiritual life is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagannātha-suta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when I was in New York recently to check the color printing of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> 7.2, we were presented with two awards which your books had won for color and design, two awards from the Printing Industries of Metropolitan New York. They gave us big wooden plaques with a certificate of excellence, yes, for <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and for <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You should show Prabhupāda, bring him those plaques.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagannātha-suta:</span> Yes, we have those plaques hanging up in the Press building now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Bring it, I shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...diminution on this path of devotional service, <span class="Italic">nehābhikrama-nāśo'sti</span> [Bg. 2.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> So does that mean that once one enters the material world, there's only progress in going back to Godhead, although it may be slow, over many lifetimes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. One is going slow, one is finishing very rapidly. If one is serious, he can finish very rapidly. If one is not serious, it will take time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...contests and get all sorts of awards and recognition. Because no one has such beautiful books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have also won awards for <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> the cover design.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cover designs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> They like the cover, but they're afraid to look inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, at the time of death, when the soul leaves the body, at that time the body is destroyed. So at the time of sleeping, when the soul leaves the body, how is the body maintained?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> At the time of sleeping, when the soul leaves the body, why is the body not destroyed at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Suppose you have left the car; does that mean it is destroyed? You are going again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But at the time of death it is destroyed when you leave it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Death is different. When the car is no more usable, that is death. But we are returning to the car because we know that it is usable. And if we know that it is useless, we don't go to that car. That is death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. At the time of sleeping, there is a subtle reality that the subtle body enters into?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Reality means as you take this awakening vision as reality, similarly, the dream vision is also real.... Nothing, none of them are reality. They are all temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> But that subtle reality is just as real as this gross reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They'll not stay. This reality will not stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's all a dreamlike existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, simply a long duration dream. Do you think this skyscraper building will stay? Nothing will stay. It may stay for five hundred years or five thousand years. But is it not permanent. Anything you take-the trees, this land, nothing; even this ocean. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> It appears again and again disappears, that's all. Everything. The material world means that. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate. Vyaktāvyaktam.</span> Sometimes manifested, sometimes not manifested. This town is manifested, and one big wave of sea, it will be nonmanifested, immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So that subtle reality is existing side by side with this gross reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reality is in the spiritual world. This is imitation reality. Real reality is in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have to go left here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (pause) The material universes are like a produce of Mahā-Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A big dream, that's all. Material existence means a big dream. How long you'll dream? So long you are in this body. And as long as the body is finished, your dream is finished. Your nation, your society, your friends, your money, your bank, everything finished. Is it not a dream? Then dream another-you become cats and dogs or demigods. You dream in a different way. You are now dreaming as American; next life you may dream something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> So every man has his own world that he's living in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? He creates his own world. Nothing is own-temporary-he creates, and Kṛṣṇa gives him the opportunity, "All right, you enjoy." <span class="Italic">Hare nāma, hare nāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Govardhana-dhārī:</span> While doing books we create an atmosphere sometimes, the devotees..., Kṛṣṇa gives us the intelligence to give the spiritual world to these living entities. How can we always stay on that transcendental platform, to make them see this? [break] (in car:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If the soul is the living force, if the soul actually leaves the body, how the body will be..., work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There's some connection still. When the soul is..., when the body..., when you are dreaming, and the soul leaves the body, but still there must be some connection between the soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Connection is there, just like you leave your car, you keep the engine going on-<span class="Italic">gug gug gug gug gug gug</span>-but you are not there. The engine, you keep it started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Somehow the soul's influence is still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You make that engine keeping-<span class="Italic">gug gug gug gug.</span> If you like you can stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it actually Kṛṣṇa who's maintaining the life in the body then? The life of the body is maintained by Kṛṣṇa or by the individual <span class="Italic">jīva</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, by Kṛṣṇa. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's property. You are thinking, "It is mine." <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> I am the proprietor of this body, but another body is there. He is the proprietor of all the bodies. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> The landlord, he's the proprietor. You are occupier, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh. So the Lord in the heart is keeping that body for that <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> so that when he's finished dreaming he comes back to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's actually the Lord that's keeping it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...the engine going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe driver. Driver is left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Driver is left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Like chauffeur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span> Kṛṣṇa has unlimited energies. Yesterday you were explaining in your garden to that priest that Kṛṣṇa, He says, Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the father of all living entities." And you were saying, "Who can challenge this or deny it?" Now someone can say that there is contradiction, if there is some contradiction in Kṛṣṇa's statement, therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who can deny? Who can contradict this? That is my challenge. The contradiction is not valid. Who can contradict it? That is my challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, say in some philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a father, a real father can say, "I am the father." Who can challenge? Father is one. Who can? Nobody can say "No, you are not father, he's father." No. The real father is father. Father cannot be replaced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Suppose real father says, "I am the father of this boy." Who will challenge it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Someone who does not believe my father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he's a rascal. But father cannot be changed. He does not know; he challenges, that's all. How the father can be changed? Father is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We say that Kṛṣṇa is all good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And then the materialist says, "If Kṛṣṇa is all good, then how is there any evil?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Evil is you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But everything comes from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything comes from.... Yes. If.... You have created a situation. So for your satisfaction, Kṛṣṇa has given you the chance, but that is evil, what you have created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But I have this propensity because I am part of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When you come under <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> you have got so many propensities. So as soon as you disobey Kṛṣṇa, the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta</span>)<span class="Italic">,</span> immediately. Just like darkness and light. As soon as you give up light, you come to darkness. There is no second alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the friend of everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So why does He allow me to have this independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is His.... Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because it is not good for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are not perfectly Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">aṁśa.</span> Kṛṣṇa has got independence. You see one son is born, even a father has got a black spot here, sometimes the son has got black spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But if it's not good for me, if I will misuse it, why would Kṛṣṇa give it to me anyway?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore the demand is "You surrender, rascal. You are suffering, you surrender. That is your good..." Therefore He comes, He loves His sons, "You rascals, why you are creating plans? You come here. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> I shall give you all comforts."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Kṛṣṇa knows everything in the past, and everything in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So when Kṛṣṇa.... Kṛṣṇa knows that I will misuse my independence, but still He gives me independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Even though it is bad for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You say Kṛṣṇa knows you are going to misuse your independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because He knows everything in the past and everything in the future. So He must.... Kṛṣṇa is all-knowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This present, future, means, just like a father knows the..., how the child is. Now if the child changes, and touches the fire, Kṛṣṇa knows it will burn. He knew when the child did not touch the fire, his future. And when he touched the fire, Kṛṣṇa knew the result. So He always knows. His position is to know the future. He's always.... Now you are changing, what is the future due to your little independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So can you actually say that Kṛṣṇa knows you'll misuse your independence? He knows if you misuse your independence what will happen, but can it be actually said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...he knows you will definitely misuse...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...you can use your independence properly, it's up to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But then that limits Kṛṣṇa. If you say that Kṛṣṇa did not know when I will misuse my indep.... or if I will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That means you do not know what is the independence. You can, you can change your position at any time. That is your independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But doesn't Kṛṣṇa know if I will do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because you are independent. That is the meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Marginal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What will the.... That will depend on.... And the result He knows. Just as a lawyer knows that he has done this, criminal, he'll be punished like this. So His position to know the future is always there. Either in this condition or other condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But the lawyer doesn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why Kṛṣṇa? Everyone knows. Suppose you have got this body; next body he's a dog. I can say you'll bark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you'll do? That's all. What to speak of Kṛṣṇa; I can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was Satsvarūpa's question, Satsvarūpa Mahārāja's question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the answer. Kṛṣṇa's position is always the same. He knows past, present and future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is Karandhara's problem, this point of philosophy. He cannot understand it. His argument is that he is having so much trouble due to his sense attraction. And Kṛṣṇa gave him the sense attraction, or Kṛṣṇa gave him senses; now he is having trouble controlling his senses. But he argues that Kṛṣṇa knows everything, so Kṛṣṇa knew that he would have trouble controlling his senses; therefore why did Kṛṣṇa give him senses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says Kṛṣṇa is playing games.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have given you charge of this BBT, millions of dollars you are dealing, but it is not for your misuse. As soon as you misuse, that is your responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, but he says but still, you'll know that I'm going to misuse it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That Kṛṣṇa knows, when something charge is given. But because you are independent, I know that "Rāmeśvara is very good boy; let him be in charge." But you can misuse at any moment, because you have got independence. You can misuse at any moment. At that time your position is different. That is this Karandhara's, he was in this position, but as soon as he misused it, immediately, Kṛṣṇa changed his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's so foolish, he blames...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our foolishness, that we cannot understand. That is our foolishness. How you can understand Kṛṣṇa's activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's the only answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Kṛṣṇa is doing.... You are little independent, but He is fully independent. He knows everything. His independence is not under condition; your independence is under condition. If you misuse your independence, you'll suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His argument is that "I should never be allowed to misuse my independence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no question of independence then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not independence. Independence means you can use properly or improperly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He cannot understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to become a machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, he'd rather be a machine and be in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, machine we are, but still there is independence. That means you are not absolutely independently, relatively. The state, you say we are American-independent. But that does not mean you can do whatever you like. As soon as you misuse, you are arrested, punished. Even the president is not independent. As soon as he misused his power, drag him, "Come out." What to speak of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's like an impersonalist. He doesn't want any individual existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he does not agree to be guided by the supreme controller. He does not agree that He is supreme controller. "I am everything." Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">mūḍhas, māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">. Mūḍha.</span> He's being controlled. As soon as there is some toothache, he goes to the doctor. And he says "I am God." He's becoming old, and he says that "I am God." Why you are becoming old? God is always young.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He has another argument. He says that he's in the grip of <span class="Italic">māyā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So even though he wants to go back to Godhead, he cannot be freed from the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> is keeping him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless you are fully surrender, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> you cannot do it. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> will not leave you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But in order to fully surrender, you have to be free from <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> will keep you freed when you fully surrender. If you surrender to your wife and many women, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's thinking freedom without Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> keeps making him full of material desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> must keep you, must keep you, must keep you because you are not surrendering fully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then he says that "As long as I have all these material urges, I cannot control them. The <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is insurmountable."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> is not.... What <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is? Punishing, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The desire is ours; it's simply either Kṛṣṇa or <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to rectify your desires. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> By chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> How do you.... But then he says, "How do you develop the strength to keep chanting even when <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is making you so attracted?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means your chanting is not pure. That is called <span class="Italic">aparādha.</span> You are thinking that "I am chanting, I am purified," and finding out another woman, illicit sex. Then how you can be purified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One argument a lot of them use is that, er,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is prohibited, <span class="Italic">aparādha.</span> If you chant with <span class="Italic">aparādha,</span> offenses, then how you can be pure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The process is to follow some rules and regulations, but they say, "How do you get the strength to follow the rules and regulations?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not your business, that is Kṛṣṇa's business. You follow Kṛṣṇa. If you cheat Kṛṣṇa, then you'll be cheated. That's all. Kṛṣṇa does not cheat you, but you create a situation to cheat yourself, and <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will make an arrangement so that you are cheated. This is <span class="Italic">māyā</span>'s business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So it's a question of honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You promise no illicit sex, no, before God, before spiritual master, before fire, and you play hypocrisy. So <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is not seeing that? How you can avoid? <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is always there. <span class="Italic">Yac cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām.</span> You cannot escape the eyes of God in so many different agencies. And still He is personally sitting within your hearts. How you can escape? You may pretend to be a very great devotee, but the Person, Supreme, He is within yourself, He's seeing everything. No cheating with Him. <span class="Italic">Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.</span> "Oh, I am chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, so even I do something wrong, it will be adjusted." Adjusted, when you are sincere, by chance you have done something. That can be adjusted. But not intentionally. As soon as there is intentional cheating, that you'll have to suffer the effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So someone who is in knowledge and commits sinful activity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...his position is very bad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...compared to the innocent person, ignorant person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But then again he argues like this, he says, "The living entity cannot do anything without the sanction of God. So I am desiring certain sinful activities, but why is Kṛṣṇa sanctioning it?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa does not sanction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then how is it going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you insist, so Kṛṣṇa, in disgust, says, "All right, do at your own risk. You rascal. You will not hear Me." That's all. I have given this example many times, that my son wanted to touch the table fan. Did I say it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I never heard it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, so, when he was only two years old, so the table fan was running, and the child, he wants to touch it. So I am: "No, don't touch." So, and he was.... So there was another friend, he was a doctor. He said that "Slow the speed and let him touch." So I did it. So he touched, <span class="Italic">"Tung."</span> (sound imitation) Then I said, "Touch again?" "No!" (laughter) So it is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh. It is actually Kṛṣṇa's mercy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...that He allows Him to feel the pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Purifies his desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But he doesn't have to feel the pain if he's obedient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If he insists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He gives instruction. Just like I said, "Don't touch. It will hurt your finger. It is not good." "No, no." "So all right, touch."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned that the more intelligent person can become obedient by hearing. The less intelligent person has to see, suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By practical experience. <span class="Italic">Dekhe sekhe thekhe sekhese. Tekhe sekhese(?)</span> means he's a fool. Unless he comes to the actual position, he does not learn. And therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra-cakṣus</span>-one who follows the <span class="Italic">śāstra's</span> instruction, he is safe. That is experienced already. (end)</div>
