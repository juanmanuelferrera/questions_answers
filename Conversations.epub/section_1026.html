<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> And then in the temple itself they're starting to fix the carved marble on these columns and it's just getting very exciting. Then on the gate they're starting to put the domes. And yesterday Saurabha and I went to see some samples of furniture, very attractive furniture. So we're going to make a model room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Model room? What is that model room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A model, sample.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We're going to fix one of the rooms on the first floor with all of the furnishings and everything just as it will be when the building is complete. But there is still other work going on. So it couldn't be used for living, but it will look just like a finished room. And Acyutānanda Swami is doing very nicely. He attends <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati</span> every morning, he gives class in the temple in the morning and in the evening. And we're having a lot of programs at Rotary clubs, Lion's Clubs, colleges and universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Mandiras.</span> And distributing literature. Well, the final lift in the building will still take until December, and then so far as another lift for your present quarters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why? There is no need of present quarter lift. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Okay. Anyway, the new lift is going according to their schedule which is much faster than their original schedule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So on the whole it is coming nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh yes. There's a lot of enthusiasm for Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Bombay. Just due to this <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī</span> we made about 15 or 20 life patron members. They just keep coming. "I visited your festival," then they come back and arrange other programs for us and become patron members. And newspaper people also are starting to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Giving some coverage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> ...good... The Free Press wants to make a two page feature with pictures all about our activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about taking action against Blitz?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well he wrote to me but I didn't have time to discuss with you. Girirāja discussed with everyone and they feel that it's not worth it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The thing is that it's not very certain that we'll win and if we file...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is not a question of winning. It is a question of discussing in the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, but that's also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the paper does not give any publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, see, their paper... You see, this man, the editor, he thrives on controversy and notoriety. So he likes cases. And then when the case comes up, he gives the report of the case in his newspaper. So most people felt that he would be very happy if we filed suit because that will increase his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be in his favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I met one, but, I knew the assistant editor of Times of India and I spoke to him about it. He said if we wrote a strong reply, we could perhaps get him to print our reply on third page. We could perhaps get him... He's done that in the past. But it's a risky gamble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There was a new article this week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Blitz?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No. I thought you might have it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They were very agitated that so many big ministers and people came to our function in Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Actually, it's like a backhanded compliment. Whatever they wrote was very favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is counteraction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. Actually it was good publicity. The headline was that the Andhra government is falling for our tricks. But all the subject was very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We got very good coverage in Hyderabad by all the papers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Have you seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, you sent me some clippings. They're very good. In bold type...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "CM praises ISKCON."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> In the Blitz in the bold type they quote the Endowments Minister that we owe a great debt of gratitude to Śrīla Prabhupāda for reminding us of the great treasure that we have in our own culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they've already owned (won) the case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, they don't know that you addressed the whole cabinet in that Endowment Minister's house. That Blitz doesn't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They mentioned that the Commissioner of Town Planning designed the temple. They mentioned that the Chief Minister came. They mentioned that we have a farm to help the poor people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> All of our credits are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Although they are Communist they just want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One thing is now that we can expect something almost every few weeks. Blitz, once it starts on something it just goes on. I think we should at least write a letter to them just saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I was... At first, I thought there is no use to meet the editor because he's a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Delhi man who wrote the story, this editor told me he's an outright Communist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually an outright Communist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The other point that people felt that nobody will take it seriously because everyone knows that it's just junk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Third-class paper. (Child speaking in background.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has a wide circulation in India. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...leave this boy in the park and we shall go. Let them come, walking. You come walking? Live here? No. Cannot walk? He can walk. Leave him here. (Prabhupāda is teasing a little child.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> That's the park! Here we are!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will come back by walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> There we are. <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> We're going to come back by the walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many Hindi words do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> I know <span class="Italic">ācchā...</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, no, very good. (laughter) [break] Sudāmā and Puruṣottama, another boy, he was also... There was competition in collecting flower. I think Sudāmā stood first. And he was coming. We have to go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Any way. We can go this way, we can go this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We want to avoid any hills and things if we can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Which one? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? He'll come walking. We are going in the car. There is no place. They can walk. They are young children. (Children playing and laughing, "<span class="Italic">Jaya </span>Śrīla Prabhupāda!") [break] ...twice, thrice in a year total.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hut! Hut!</div>
