<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the business of the representative of Kṛṣṇa to push the nipple. (?) Because they know what is the necessity. The whole world is upset for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the necessity. It is not a, I mean to say, whimsical sporting. It is the necessity. But they do not know. It is a very responsible task. That is called <span class="Italic">prayojana.</span> Is it clear? What do you think? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, they... There has to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know. The scientists, they do not know what is the necessity. (laughs) Do they know? Do you think, all the scientists, do they know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If they know, they'll be all <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They think it is necessary to gratify the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think that, that by gratifying senses... Therefore they are having the same sex at home, again going to the naked dance. They think, "This thing will be able to give me happiness." But that is not giving, actually. Then they become mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Chewing the chewed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chewing the chewed, that's all. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know. That is the mistake of the whole civilization. They do not know what is the necessity. They are manufacturing, <span class="Italic">durāśayā bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> By adjustment of this external energy they are trying. You'll see the whole world, especially in the western world, they do not know what is the necessity. Here at least there are <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> there are gurus, people at least taking, still, although it is dead now. But in the western world they do not know at all. Their only happiness is this sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi sukhaṁ hi tuccham kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Itching. Itching sensation. More and more itching and the itches are increasing. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena...</span> They examples are given very nice. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham. Karayoḥ</span> means hands. There is itching sensation, like this, like this, like this. And the itching disease is increasing. So therefore it is advised that <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpanā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> By itching, by satisfying the senses, itching sensation, then troubles and miserable condition increasing. That they do not know. Increasing. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpanā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ. Bahu</span> means much, <span class="Italic">duḥkha</span> means miserable condition. Therefore one who is sensible: <span class="Italic">kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> one (who) is sober, he understands, "What I am doing? I am simply trying to eat and the disease is increasing. Therefore it must be stopped." This is called <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> That is, one word is used, <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> in <span class="Italic">Kumāra-sambhava.</span> That Pārvatī was induced. Lord Śiva was in meditation, and the necessity was that Kārttikeya... Kārttikeya means, "With the semina of Lord Śiva and Pārvatī's, what is called? Semen, they mix together, the child will be born. He can kill these demons." Therefore Kārttik... So Lord Śiva was engaged in meditation. So Pārvatī was engaged to worship the genital of Lord Śiva. That... Therefore they introduced this, <span class="Italic">Śiva-liṅga</span> is worshiped. <span class="Italic">Śiva-liṅga.</span> So when she was worshiping, a young girl touching the genital, but he was sitting without any disturbance. Therefore he has been described, <span class="Italic">dhīra. Dhīra.</span> One who is not disturbed by the sex impulse even in the presence of very beautiful young girl, he is called <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> So <span class="Italic">kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ.</span> One has to become <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> That is wanted. Just like Haridāsa, Ṭhākura. Twice he was induced by very beautiful young girl at dead of night. But he remained... "Yes, I'll satisfy you." He turned... That is called <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> There is another place. The <span class="Italic">dhīra</span> word is used in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">That <span class="Italic">dhīra. Dhīras tatra na muhyati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Even by death he is not disturbed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not disturbed. So one has to become <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> Then he'll be satisfied. Then he'll be satisfied. Then... That is the <span class="Italic">prayojana-siddhi,</span> to finish this business, material business, and completely prepare for going back to home, back to Godhead. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very strict. He therefore advised, <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya. Bhagavad-bhajan,</span> devotional service of the Lord means <span class="Italic">paraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya.</span> Going to the other side of this material ocean. So one who is serious about going to the other side of this ocean, for him, two things are very dangerous. <span class="Italic">Viṣayināṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitām ca hā hanta hā hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'py asādhu</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 11.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is dangerous, it is most heinous activities than drinking poison. What are these? <span class="Italic">Viṣayināṁ sandarśanam,</span> to mix with the... Or... Mix very intimately with the materialistic person and to have association with woman with sense purpose. <span class="Italic">Yoṣitām.</span> To see woman is not bad, but as soon as one sees woman with a sensual purpose, that is very condemned. That is condemned. So unless one becomes <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> he cannot do that. So we have to finish this business of material sensuous engagement and become <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> Then we are fit candidate for going back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That, that <span class="Italic">dhīra</span> cannot be attained artificially. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless you find something better than the sex life, you cannot be <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa's name is Madana-Mohana. Madana means Cupid. Cupid is enchanting everyone. Everyone is enchanted by Cupid. Madana-dahan(?). And Kṛṣṇa is Madana-Mohana, He enchants Cupid. And Rādhārāṇī is Madana-mohana-mohinī, (S)he enchants Kṛṣṇa. Madana-Mohana-mohinī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One is Madan-madan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One is Madana, and Kṛṣṇa enchants Madana. Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful that Madana becomes enchanted by Kṛṣṇa. And Rādhārāṇī is so beautiful that Kṛṣṇa becomes enchanted. That is spiritual sex. That is not ordinary. Therefore the attraction of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is not ordinary thing. <span class="Italic">Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir,</span> this is the spiritual energy, display of spiritual energy. But the <span class="Italic">sahajiyās,</span> they take as material attractions. As we are attracted, men and women, similarly, they take the Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa attraction... (end)</div>
