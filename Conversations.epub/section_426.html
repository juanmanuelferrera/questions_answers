<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That <span class="Italic">dharma</span> by which the soul becomes fully satisfied, can it be found anywhere else aside from Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think. Because they are all <span class="Italic">ahaitukī;</span> there is motive. Motive. And conditional. Therefore it is very difficult. And it is clearly said, <span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihatā.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> ...the founder of our International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> This is Prabhupāda's first visit to Rome, to Italy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Oh yes. You will stay some days here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You have visited India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Oh, I have been many times, yeah, in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You have been to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> No, I have been to Vārāṇasī, to Calcutta, to Bombay, Agra, Darjeeling and many other places in... Nepal also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nepal. My birthplace is in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Yes, very nice. In Delhi, and Monsignor too, he has visited all the places, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> South India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> In Kerala?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Kerala, Tirusrilapatti(?), Cochin, Madras, Bombay of course. Yes, last year I attended a kind of manifestation of your movement in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes, I visited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bombay, there was function.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time, you were there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> In January.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> At Cross Maidan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> That was our festival. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> discourses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We had a festival program in India. We've had one in Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, and for one week, and Srila Prabhupāda has spoken many times every night there. There's been thousands of people, ten thousand people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes, yes. And just last year about the 20th of January, it was this week of festivals also, this <span class="Italic">conscience</span> of preaching sermons, many manifestations. Many people attended, and I too visited this, yes, also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta also we had such functions. About thirty thousand people were coming in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Could you be so kind to say to us something about your movement which is spread in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our movement is that, that is first-class religious system which teaches how to love God. This is the sum and substance of our movement. There is a Sanskrit statement in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo<br class="calibre2"/>yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>ahaituky apratihatā<br class="calibre2"/>yayātmā suprasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If you want to be happy, then you must take to the superior type of religious system which teaches the followers how to love God without any motive, and which is never checked by any material condition. God's name is given here as <span class="Italic">Adhokṣaja. Adhokṣaja</span> means beyond experimental knowledge. God has got many name according to different situation, and one of the name, for the materialistic person, <span class="Italic">adhokṣaja. Akṣaja</span> means experimental knowledge. <span class="Italic">Akṣa</span> means eyes or senses. Beyond sense perception. So we cannot speculate about God, but we can understand about God from authorities. This is the conception of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma.</span> So the human life is especially meant for understanding God. That is the version of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> Vedānta philosophy. The Vedānta philosophy teaches, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>,</span> "Now this human form of body, which is above the lower grades of forms..." There are 8,400,000 forms of body. The soul is transmigrating, evolution. But when we get this human form of body, our main business is to inquire about God. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Now, if somebody inquires what is God, the immediate reply is, God is the source, original source of everything. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> So the human form of life is meant for understanding God, and according to our philosophy, if human body is not utilized for understanding God, then it is misused. If we simply spoil our life like the animals, eating, sleeping, sex life and defending, then the human life is spoiled like animals. The real necessity of human life is to understand God. Not only to understand God superficially, but to understand our eternal relationship with Him, and then <span class="Italic">prayojana,</span> the ultimate goal of life, is to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is ultimate goal. And if you simply try to understand God, as we get it from the revealed scriptures, then after giving up this body, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ... Deham</span> means this body. After this death... There are many deaths in many bodies, but after this death, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> he does not enter again into the material body. In his original spiritual body he goes back to home, back to Godhead. So this is sum and substance of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and we have got many Vedic literatures about it, especially the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So we have published <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> The publisher is Messrs. MacMillan and Company, and we are selling. It has already gone fifth edition. And each edition they have published fifty-thousand copies and this is the preliminary study book, to understand God. And then, when one is passed of this knowledge, then he can be given the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> which we have published like this, sixty volumes, all original verses from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> and explained. Then... This is graduate study. Then after this there is post-graduate study, this <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> This book is in twelve volumes, and other book, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> is sixty volumes. There are many other corollaries, just like <span class="Italic">Science of Devotion.</span> Have you got this book? No. <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion.</span> So we have already published about two dozen books of this nature. So people are accepting, especially in the western countries. Recently we have received report. Some of the learned scholar professors, they have ordered all the books. They have introducing in their class. Yale University, Temple University. And they are enlisting my books in the bibliography, of Indian philosophy, and they are distributing to the learned circles. And last year we have sold four millions pieces of literature in the western countries. So we are encouraged. And these boys, young boys, they have encouraged me by joining this movement. And one priest in Boston, he issued one pamphlet that "These boys are our boys. How is that? Before that, they did not come to church. They did not inquire what is God. And now why they are mad after God?" This was his remark. And some of the American public, they inquire from them, "Are you Americans?" So this movement is getting ground all over the world, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And amongst the higher scholarly section also. This is sum and substance of our movement. Our principle is to become sinless. Because in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you will find this verse. Find out.</div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Yeṣām, y-e-s-a-m. A person who is completely free from all sinful contamination, such person can become a pure devotee of God. <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām, te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā.</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam </span>that if one actually wants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees; but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence. All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violation of God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we forbid our students to refrain from four sinful activities: No illicit sex life, no meat-eating, and no intoxication, up to drinking tea, coffee or smoking. They are also intoxicants. And no gambling. These four principles, they avoid completely. And as it is recommended in this book, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru: [Bg. </span>18.65] "Always think of Me," <span class="Italic">man-manā.</span> "Just become My devotee. Just offer your obeisances unto Me, and just worship Me." Four principles. If you follow these four principles without any offense, then you go back to home, back to Godhead. So for remembering God, you chant always God's name on these beads.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(buzzer sounds) And we worship... (pause) (one man is apparently showing pictures) This is also a church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> This is Japan. This is from Tibet. Also a gift of Dalai Lama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Buddhist, but this is from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Hindu temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes. The Mahakrish(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Well, I think that because you are friends of God, we are friends of God, we are all friends and this is good. But I think that, if I understand it well, that your aim is to reach people who are unbelievers or people who are atheistic, as you said before. And then I would like to know... You are not obliged, you are completely free to do what you want. But I would like to know if you got into these places or amongst these people... There are many places and many peoples in the world who are in these conditions, without faith and without the spiritual values. Because it is for us, we hope so. We are good friends of God, and we are always in our prayers and meditation united to God, and to... But we thank you for your visit and for your, for this reason we are good friends altogether. But I would like to know historically your work, I mean if you go into these areas or into these places where is possible. For instance, take the example of Russia, eh? Now you are in good relations. India and Russia probably for Indians it is easier than for Europeans or for some of our countries or for Americans. Are you... Have you this problem? Do you go into these areas, into these places?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I went to Moscow. I was invited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Because they need badly. They need this spirit of friendship with God and with His supreme values. God... Well, I wouldn't say to the Moslem world because they are good believers. And God is probably, they are more faithful to. And for instance, these areas of the modern world like, also in the States sometimes, because these big cities like New York or Tokyo or Toronto, and some, these are cities, where they are areas where spiritual values have no meaning for these people. It's a pity and we have to be very open and very friendly to them. I gather this. And your method is meditation and prayer, if I understand it well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two things. We recommend two things. For the mass of people, this prayer, <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> a prayer. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma. So this is prayer. Hare means appealing to the energy of God, and Kṛṣṇa is God. "O the energy of God, O God, please engage me in your service." This is the sum and substance of the Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare: "O the energy of God, 'Kṛṣṇa,' O the Lord, please engage me in Your service." Because we are now engaged in the service of Satan, <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> I think... <span class="Italic">Māyā.</span> So therefore we are suffering. Service we have to render. Because we are meant for rendering service. But when you forget God, then you render service to <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Therefore it is the prayer to God that "Please pick me from this service and engage me to Your service." That's all. Service is my occupation. I cannot become master. That is not possible. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they sometimes say that "We are now in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> As soon as we are out in <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then we become master." We do not agree to this philosophy. We remain servant even after liberation. We are servant here and we are servant always. Just like a citizen and government. The government is always master. If you do not accept the laws of government, then you are put into prison. There also you are subjected to the laws of God, or the government. Similarly, either in <span class="Italic">māyā</span> or liberated, we are always servant, eternal servant. But when we are servant in liberation, giving service to God, that is our real life or real happiness. But when we give service to the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that is our miserable condition. So in Moscow I have been. I had a long talk with Professor Kotofsky, the Indologist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Yes. Did you talk with people there? Were you permitted, were you allowed to talk with the people in the streets and so on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> You were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not on the street. Some of the boys, they came to my hotel. So so far I saw, the people, they are very nice. They are very nice, but the government supresses their sentiments. Everyone has got religious sentiments. The people is as good as in other places. I don't find any difference. It is not that the whole Russia is atheist. It is not that. They are as others. They are like that. And our philosophy is that everyone is God conscious; simply it is being suppressed, either by the so-called leaders or by the influence of external energy, which is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> We have got a verse in this <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> where it is said that <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya kabhu naya.</span> It is not an artificial thing. To make one God conscious is not artificial. God consciousness is there, even in the life of aborigines, most crude people. It has to be awakened by education. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte.</span> One has to be educated. And he should be given chance to hear about God. And then, as soon as he becomes purified in his consciousness, he accepts and begins to love God. So it is not an artificial thing. Either in Russia or any place, any human being, he has got dormant love for God. It has to be awakened by processes. Therefore I began: That process which quickly awakens that God consciousness and engages him in the service of the Lord, that is first-class religious system. <span class="Italic">Paro dharmaḥ. Paraḥ</span> means first-class. But a simply sentiment will not help. Therefore religion must be based on philosophy, and my spiritual master used to say this, that "Philosophy without religion is mental speculation, and religion without philosophy is sentimental." They should be combined. Philosophy and religion must be... Or religion must be based on philosophy. Then it is perfect. We cannot separate these two things. Simple philosophical speculation will not help, and simple sentiments, rituals, formalities, will not also. They should be combined. So this combination is here in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> In our Christian faith the love of God is joined with the love for man. Are you also interested with this love for man, for our rivals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, love for man... Let me say it. Love for man is imperfect conception because God is for everyone. God is not monopolized by simply the human society. The animal society, the bird society, the tree society, they are all living entities, soul. According to our <span class="Italic">karma,</span> they are differently dressed. That is the most important philosophy, that soul is part and parcel of God. Somehow or other, the soul is now separated from the service of the Lord, and according to his desire of enjoying this material world, he has been offered different types of body. So either human being or animal or trees or aquatics, birds, beasts, everyone, all living entities, they are all part and parcel of God. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ.</span> Can you find out this?</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>sambhavanti <span class="Italic">(yaḥ)</span> <span class="Italic">murtayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ mahad-yonir brahma<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/></span> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">There are different species of life, <span class="Italic">sarva-yoni. Yoni</span> means species of life. And there are forms, different forms. But within that form... Yes, read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>murtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. So from God's standpoint of view, we cannot take simply that simply to serve the human being is to serve God. Another point is that living entities, the service, according to Sanskrit conception, service is offered to the superior. And to the inferior, mercy. There are two words. <span class="Italic">Sevā,</span> the Sanskrit word, <span class="Italic">sevā,</span> and <span class="Italic">dayā.</span> You know something of Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Somewhat, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Seva</span> means service. So service is offered to the superior. And to the inferior or subordinate, we offer our compassion. So similarly, as we are eager to give service, similarly, we should be eager to be compassionate. So it is not very good idea. Just like in India they say, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> Some nation, that to give service to the human being, and cut the throat of the animals. This philosophy is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes. I have something in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If I am not wrong, in the Chapter Eighteen of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> verse sixty-four, there is the affirmation that God loves man, "You are beloved for Me." And in some cases, we consider this affirmation as the very core of Indian religiosity, and we appreciate very much this affirmation of love of God for man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> What do you think about this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Man is supposed to be elevated position, how to love God. Animals cannot make [break] ...any distinction between a human being and animal. That is really the symptom of God, that <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu...</span> Just like if I am obedient son of my father, how can I neglect one son who is very stupid? Rather, if I say to my father, "Father, this son is stupid. He does not bring any service. So please allow me to cut his head," the father will never agree. The father, either a stupid son or very intelligent son, he is kind to everyone, because they are sons. So similarly, if a man is real lover of God, he cannot cut throat of the animals. I think, therefore, Jesus Christ said, "Thou shalt not kill." That is not... If actually one is lover of God, how he can give trouble, pains, to others? That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Excuse me if I insist on the first question I asked for. Your aim, your most important aim, if I understood it well, is to bring the faith and love for God to man. No? This is your first aim, to encourage man to be a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lover of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> To become lovers of God, friends to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> All right. Do you believe, I mean now from the point of view of facts, or events, not of ideas, of events, of reality, do you think there are many these men who are without spiritual ideas in the world of today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mostly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Mostly. You think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> And then you think that men of God are a minority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> This you admit. Well, and then I ask for a second question. Before I give to you an example. I have a hobby, as many men in the world, they have their own hobbies. My hobby is to, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God has also some hobby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Yes. What I used to do when I am traveling... I travel a lot. I used to make friends among young people, generally teenagers. And then I choose also-I try to do this-people who are unbelievers, who are in difficulties, who are men of the weak faith, and who don't love, at least, they say they don't love God. Because I think that we are few men who love God, friends to God... We are not many. And we have to go and to look for these people, and for these areas or environments, where these peoples live. And it is for this reason that I say always when I am good friends, you know... Priests, Catholic priests, well, go to an area because here is too many. They don't need you here, but go to, well, I would say Stockholm or Copenhagen where there are a few really also, Christians, I mean Catholic or Protestants. We are all brothers. But they go there because there are very few people who are dedicated to God. What do you believe about this? I mean your society, your movement, your spiritual movement, is dedicated for this kind of people and for these areas, or not? I ask. It's not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> For all. Well, also we are for all. But I mean, you have not so many people. You have some thousand people. Do you prefer for this your people? Do you prefer they go to a place where God is not known, where spiritual values are not estimated? Or they go also to places where God is loved and God is present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we go everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you go in the villages of Africa. They are almost aborigines, with their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Local people. Local citizens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our process is so nice, that is recommended process in this age-the chanting the holy name of God. So we chant this holy name of God, perhaps you have seen. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, we dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then anyone, even children, they join. Even the children, they join. Man, woman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> It is very similar to the Christian masses. We bring it everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no such distinction. So to the mass of people, we chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> But when there are learned scholars, elevated person, then we present about our philosophy. And we have got so many writings. Both ways: the mass and the class, or the scholars. We are prepared to meet everyone. Our mission is to make everyone, no distinction, that "This class should be given preference, and that should be neglected." No. We have got instrument to awaken everyone. By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> we can enthuse thousands and thousands of men to join us. And those who are advanced in philosophy and religious system, we have got these books. So we do not neglect anyone. We approach everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Well, thank you for your explanations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it is being effective. It is being effective. In our group we find Africans, Americans, Indians, Europeans, Canadians, Japanese, Chinese, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> And what concern the Buddhist countries where God is not so, at least, the prayers or the name of God is not so well known. I am just coming from Bangkok where we had a meeting with Buddhist monks of the (indistinct), and have you also some movement, some kind of action to spread love of God to (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Buddhists, they do not believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal and Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So according to our Vedic conception, Buddhist philosophy is atheistic philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Theoretically yes, but practically, do you think they are atheistic, practically? Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Our... Yes. Theoretically atheistic, but because they believe in Lord Buddha, they are theistic. Because we accept Lord Buddha as incarnation of God, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Also some of them, they believe in... They think Buddha is a god, and they are believers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Buddha is God. That is stated. You will find?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Excuse me if I go back for a moment to this question which is not that I ask if you are, excuse it, if you go only to some, you go to all the people. I agree this is not (indistinct). But because we are few... I give an example. Why, instead of going, suppose, to South Africa where the majority, the great majority, are believers, you don't go to Japan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> This is more important because you have not so many. If you go to South Africa, and although... I mean because also we. We have not so many. It's a question of possibility, of chances. Why don't you choose...? This is my question. These areas where Japan for instance is an area very atheistic and where yesterday I had this sect with me of the not perfectly... It's called... No. It's a different one. Mr. Kalyana is the president. He came yesterday. He came yesterday. Mr. Kalyana. Well, they don't believe, as you say. This is philosophy. Welfare, is happiness, but not in your meaning, in my meaning. Well, this is only to ask, then you go to Japan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, we have a center in Tokyo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have got center in Japan, in Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Are you welcome in Japan? People are interested, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Recently some of our preachers, they have collected fifty-thousand dollars from the Japanese people. They wanted to contribute me for my Vṛndāvana temple, but the Japanese government will not allow to let the money go out. He wrote me. And I have seen personally, when I went... I went to Japan three, four times. These Japanese boys and girls, they are as good as these American, Europeans boys. And that is my practical... Or they, they are my students. They offer me respect so much. The Japanese boys, without being my students, they offer the same respect. So I thought that Japan is very good. Everywhere. That I told you already, that the love of Godhead is dormant in everyone. It doesn't matter what he is. It is the process to awaken that love of Godhead: That is first-class religion. The matter is already there. Simply we have to awaken. And now, that process which awakens very quickly, that is first-class religion. That is the first... And besides that, really understanding of God is very rarely found. Find out this verse,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"Out of many millions of persons," <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu,</span> "somebody is trying to make his life perfect."

<div class="After-Verse">"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavour for perfection. And of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read the purport.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga, dhyāna-yoga, </span>and discrimination of the self from matter. However, Kṛṣṇa can only be known by persons who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramātmā. The <span class="Italic">yogīs </span>and <span class="Italic">jñānīs </span>are confused in their attempts to understand Kṛṣṇa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, has admitted in his <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> commentary that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept Kṛṣṇa as such, for it is very difficult to know Kṛṣṇa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. </span>It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>or devotional service is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not easy. The so-called path of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in his <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā<br class="calibre2"/>aikāntikī harer bhaktir utpātāyaiva kalpate.<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Brs.</i> 1.2.101]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Nārada-pañcarātra, </span>etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Paramātmā realized <span class="Italic">yogī</span> to understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yaśodā or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Kṛṣṇa: "<span class="Italic">muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ</span>," "<span class="Italic">māṁ tu veda na kaścana</span>." "No one knows Me as I am," the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then "<span class="Italic">sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ</span>." "Such a great soul is very rare." Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know Kṛṣṇa as He is <span class="Italic">(tattvataḥ), </span>even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Kṛṣṇa, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because Kṛṣṇa is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse">ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyāiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ <br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"No one can understand Kṛṣṇa as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him." <span class="Italic">(Padma Purāṇa)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the position is, that hardly, out of many millions, one can actually understand what is God. So our field of activity is everywhere in that sense, not in this particular and that particular... Because in truth hardly very few people understands what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Yeah, that's wonderful. We ought to see you in India sometimes for real again and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Do they have a copy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Professor Dimock has said very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes, we have also many translations. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not brought by the fruit?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Professor Dimock's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> It's very strange and famous. That's the gospel.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> (reading) "Swami Bhaktivedanta comments upon the <span class="Italic">Gita</span> from this point of view. And that is legitimate."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A Kṛṣṇa devotee interpreting on Kṛṣṇa, and a nondevotee interpreting on Kṛṣṇa. There is far difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Oh, yes, oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So mostly the editors are by nondevotee. So they cannot interpret.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Oh, yes. The same problem we have with our scriptures, because when the scriptures are interpreted by devotees, by believers, they are very faithful translated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is because it is legitimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Monsignor Verrozano:</span> Yes, it's very important.</div>

Dimock, Department of South Asian Languages and Civilization, University of Chicago. Please take this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Pignedoli:</span> Thank you. It will be a source also for unprofessionals, also to give true interpretation yes, by devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The trades manager of Messrs. MacMillan Company, he has reported that this book is selling increasing, and other editions, they are decreasing.</div>
