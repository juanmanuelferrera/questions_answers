<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...clean. That also we sometimes neglect. [break]...means <span class="Italic">rūpena jāyate iti prajā.</span> Everything which is born, that is <span class="Italic">prajā.</span> [break] ...children, our grandmother used to engage us for watering work, these pots. And that water was brought from down, two, three stories down, and we used to bring and put. That is good exercise and sport also, competition between children. [break] ...<span class="Italic">karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ.</span> Everyone should be engaged. That is supervision. [break] ...are also engaged in serving Kṛṣṇa. They give flower, and they're offering: "Take this flower. Offer to Kṛṣṇa." This is service, dedicating. This is explained by Kṛṣṇa to Balarāma while going through the Vṛndāvana forest, that "Just see how the trees are welcoming You, how the birds..." You have got that picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hrdayananda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is seeing that, how everyone is ready to serve. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakta</span> also sees how everyone is eager to serve Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...engage them rightly, that is leadership. Yes. Otherwise <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> As a blind leader is leading other blind men, this whole world is going on like that. They do not know how to properly lead the people. Misleaders. [break] ...grains, cows, all they should be very properly taken care of and the products offered to Kṛṣṇa. Everyone should be engaged as Kṛṣṇa's servant. That is Vṛndāvana. In Vṛndāvana everyone is engaged how to please Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. [break] ...business to study <span class="Italic">Vedānta.</span> In Vṛndāvana life we see they were not interested to know what is Brahman. They were interested how to please Kṛṣṇa, how to see Kṛṣṇa smiling. That is Vṛndāvana. Huh? Is it not? From Vṛndāvana picture you see they are simply busy to see how Kṛṣṇa is smiling. They didn't care for studying. What they will study? They were all village girls born in the ordinary class, and they did not know. [break] That is the... <span class="Italic">Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim: [Nārada-pañcarātra]</span> "If Kṛṣṇa is served, then where is the necessity of <span class="Italic">tapasya</span>?" No more <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> is meant for the third-grade men to come to the stage of serving Kṛṣṇa. And one who is, with heart and soul is serving Kṛṣṇa, he has finished all <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur ārya</span> [SB 3.33.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> They have already finished all this <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Therefore they have come to this stage. <span class="Italic">Kṛta-punya-punjaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 10.12.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is called?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Heaps of pious activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, heaps of, yes. [break] ...Mahāprabhu, He immediately gives how to love and serve Kṛṣṇa, because this Kali-yuga, they will not be able to follow the regulative principles and become elevated. So He is therefore <span class="Italic">mahā-vadānyāya.</span> He is giving a process-immediately, if followed, he becomes a lover of Kṛṣṇa and His service, immediately. <span class="Italic">Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.53]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...circumambulating you, Prabhupāda, paying respects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course, their vision, <span class="Italic">mahā-bhāgavata...</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughs) That is very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You mean the music?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, it's very nice. He has blue eyes and big black body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Blue eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. It's amazing. If you look closely you will see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> The <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they didn't like very much being instructed by Uddhava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That was dry for them. They asked Uddhava, "Bring Kṛṣṇa. We don't want you any more..." [break] What is his name? That...? Tapomāyā. Tapa... He never sees whether it is watered. He is in charge of agricultural department? Where is Jayapatāka? He never sees. One man should be in charge to see things are being done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Each... What was that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Each flat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Each floor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, each floor. Yes. But Tapomāyā, he does not see even that the water is... He is in charge of agriculture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, it can be understood how he is seeing, he is managing. He does not see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Right now we only have about four or five men here that are managing everything. He is also purchasing all the things for the festival. The GBC's have been requested to give some men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he has no time. Then why he says that "I am in charge." He is not in charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He is trying to... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After all, they are boys. They are not grown up. [break] ...your Calcutta program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> They're going tomorrow morning. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">maṭha,</span> and then we went to Mādhava Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">maṭha.</span> So Acyutānanda gave a very strong lecture at Mādhava Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> that in order to make devotees who are chanting the holy name, it takes more than any material calculation or business sense, that you have be infused with the potency of the Supreme Lord. All of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> were standing out on the balcony and hearing Acyutānanda glorify Your Divine Grace. All the devotees went in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...small card. So one card is put into the shoes, and one card is in his hand. That's all. Number. Suppose twenty shoes duplicate, so one twenty card is put into the shoe and one number twenty in his hand. So a man can see that it is his shoe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Instead of requesting ten <span class="Italic">paisā,</span> they may be requested to offer something to the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Nothing. Let them come and see. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> [break] Our Deity is not beggar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He is bestower. He gives everything. If anyone voluntary gives, that's all right. You should not ask. [break] ...instead of doing this. (Bengali) He said like that. "By showing the Deity to earn livelihood is condemned. Better become a sweeper, municipal sweeper, and sweep the road and earn money." He said like that. That is better, honorable. He is working and getting money, instead of making a good show of Deity and earn money. This is not required. If you want to earn money, go, work according to your capacity and earn money. Don't cheat people. That is Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> There was a big fight or difference of opinion, wasn't there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> There was trouble in Nabadwip, wasn't there, when he advised the pilgrims not to pay money to go into the temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was fight against it. All, Nabadwip, Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana is not so... But still, they have got rate. One thing, it is a question of heart, that a man should come and visit the temple-he must give something. Why he is to be asked? Voluntarily he should give that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes. We were reading in <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion</span> this morning. Your Divine Grace is writing that it is customary in India that whenever one visits the Deity or a saintly person to offer something, even one grain of rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But encouraging is not recommended?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that encouraging?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Requesting should not be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> It is voluntary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Encouraging means your behavior should be so nice that he voluntarily gives. That is encouraging, not that begging and "Put something here. My belly is empty." (laughter) ...that is nice, that "Here is an institution. You kindly become a member. Help us." That is another thing. But why should you earn by showing the Deity? You work so nicely they will become voluntarily member, contributing. That is nice. But not that "Now we have got Deity. He's starving. Please give me something." No. That is not good prac...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> You showed the example when you came to New York. You were cooking <span class="Italic">capatis</span> and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise who would cook at that time? [break] ...apartment. So I was cooking, and he liked. He thought that "Without any payment, I have got a cook."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Dharmadhyaksa dāsa used to be one of his disciples before he joined your, he became your disciple. And he said that he was talking to Dr. Miśra, and Dr. Miśra still talks about your cooking. He said, "Oh, <span class="Italic">Swamijī,</span> he saved my life." He said, "He taught me how to eat properly." He still talks about you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...improved his health. He says still?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Dharma was telling me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...to rise early in the morning and do whatever is needed. Then, at nine, half-past nine, I will go his apartment and begin cooking. Then, after finishing, I'll take my bathing, and then we shall eat together. And then, after eating, I will go to the Fifth Avenue for loitering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So I was cooking once only, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Your loitering was very fruitful even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was studying Americans, how they are walking, how they are shopping, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> One time you said you were happier then, maintaining yourself, than having thousands of disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was no chance of finding fault. (laughter) Now I have to find fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> [break] ...New York now named Jaya Nimāi Nitai. When you were first in New York, he was a musician. He used to write music, and he used to get inspired by looking down from his apartment down to the street. And every day he said he used to see this little Indian man walking by, and it was you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And he couldn't figure out what was going on, this man walking by on the street every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I was having morning walk regularly, alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He said you used to walk very fast. [break] (Indian band playing)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is near Atlanta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. [break] ...He taught them to steal then: "Mother is not giving. You steal." That picture is going on. [break] Juhu is so small?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes, we should have made it bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The size of the cart is restricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What year is that?</div>
