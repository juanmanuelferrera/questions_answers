<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So a lot of these parents are saying that we should all be, we should be investigated. Now they are saying that we are not Hindus and they are saying that by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, they're thinking of the brain stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So in New York the press is against us. But in Los Angeles it is going in our favor, he said (refers to report by Rāmeśvara). In Los Angeles they had kidnapped the best girl distributor. Now she has come back but ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these things will happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are, as soon as we become very important, our enemies, they will try to suppress us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is what they are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, that is natural. Even Kṛṣṇa was suppressed. Kṛṣṇa could not be suppressed but the attempt was there. Kamsa. So these things go on, still we have to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If we work sincerely then we'll come out successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So there are a few things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We should not be afraid. <span class="Italic">Yuddhyasva mām anusmara [</span>Bg. 8.7<span class="Italic">].</span> Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna that you fight, not that you shall not fight. We shall fight to the best of our... And this is good, they are feeling the pressure of this movement. Otherwise why they are going to take step?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they, these parents what they want to do, they want this to be declared illegal. Now they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can, the children can also, those who are our children they can form an association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they cannot control us, our independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should form. How the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But of course we want to defeat them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The parents, the parents cannot control their sons and daughters who is above eighteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We want to defeat these people legally because now it's a very big case and every paper in America is covering it. Every paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they're feeling pressure. They're feeling pressure. Now we should take proper steps, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had a big press conference in which Prof. Sukla spoke up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. He has written very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rāmeśvara said he got up and he said "How can... You are insulting our religion..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, better that the Indians should combine and they should bring a case against these people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then it will be alright. That this is, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is genuine, and these people are trying to insult us. Bring a defamation case against these persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think the best thing is to mobilise all the Indians in America because every country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I have already suggested, that they should take signature from all Indians that this is genuine Indian cultural movement and it a great fortune for Indians. They were bereft of their own culture and now we have got this culture again. The Ratha-yātrā is going on, we are so much enlivened. In this way they should file petition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like in England they would not let you do the Ratha-yātrā, the Indians...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. This is discrimination against sect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Against minority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Against minority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And no government in the world wants to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is against American constitution. So they should file immediately a case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And America is very sensitive to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you note down, you are simply hearing. Note down and inform them. Yes. Ah, it is being recorded, that's alright. So give them this direction. Combine the Indian community. In Toronto and in..., there are many thousands of Indians, New York, Canada, London. These are very important places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, many thousands and thousands of important Indians, very rich men there are. In London there are very rich Indians. They can form immediately a solid association. They should present that this Kṛṣṇa is our God. In every Indian home we observe Kṛṣṇa Janmāṣṭamī. Even though one does not follow Kṛṣṇa cult, still if he is Hindu he follows the Janmāṣṭamī. Inevitably, everywhere. So this Kṛṣṇa cult is genuine, Vedic, based on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> which was spoken long, long years ago before any religion, any religious literature in the world. The Buddha literature or the Christian literature and Jewish literature, they cannot be counted more than two thousand years. A little more than that. But this Kṛṣṇa cult is coming, it is coming from, I have already explained in the introduction, it is coming from four hundred millions of years ago. But even from historically, it is five thousand years. Beyond all religious literature in the world. We have to present this case in the court. And let it be discussed thorough (indistinct), and see our books, compare any religious books with our these books. Present all the opinions of big, big professors how traditional Indian culture is there. You have to fight, organize (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. (repeats "Yes" every so often)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can defeat us? We have got so solid ground. How they can defeat, these rascals? We consider them simply rascals and fools. And we call them rascals and fools. What do they know of religion? What do they know of God? They know slaughterhouse and killing and illicit sex, and killing the fetus. That's all. What do they know? They are not even civilized. We have come to make them civilized. They should understand. They are not civilized. They do not (know) how to eat even. The first principle of life is eating. They do not know how to eat. We are teaching them how to eat. They simply challenge, that's... When men are uncivilized, they do not how to grow food, they kill animals in the jungle and eat. When they are civilized, they know how to grow food now and the nice food grains, fruit, flowers, now why should say, "You eat the meat." The meat-eating is meant for the most uncivilized persons. That means they do not know even how to eat. They do not know how to eat. How to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex. Nothing. They're having sex like cats and dogs. No marriage, girl's friend, boy's friend, and then illegitimate... So many things. They should be exposed. And there is no harm exposing, in truth. Simply by manufacturing, constructing a big, high skyscraper building, does it mean he is civilized? It is passionate work. They can take credit of a good <span class="Italic">mistri,</span> just like so many <span class="Italic">mistris,</span> they construct. I cannot do. Does it mean I am less than him? I could not construct this temple. I have to call some low class, a builder and company, they constructed. Does it meant he is higher in intelligence than me? They are giving credit, "Oh, now they have constructed skyscraper building. They have constructed motorcar, horseless carriage." They are taking credit on this. But this is not civilization. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has given the formula of civilization, three words: <span class="Italic">matṛvat para dāreṣu.</span> Where is that civilization? To consider every woman as mother. Except one's own married wife, all women, mother. Where is that civilization? That should be, otherwise there cannot be social regulation. <span class="Italic">Matṛvat para dāreṣu para dravyeṣu loṣṭravat,</span> other's property is just like garbage in the street. Nobody touches the garbage. That is civilization. So Mr. Pillay... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...got to do. He wants members of parliament to give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That we have already suggested. Immediately. Every member of... If Mr. ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Krishna Modi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmānanda (Reddy), he suggested that this movement should be spread all over the world. Let him write.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He won't give it in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is his insincerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Frankly Śrīla Prabhupāda, no member of parliament will give it either. I know because even when Tejas was applying for his citizenship, Krishna Modi would not even give a letter of recommendation because he said this is a Congress Party policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what can be done. Everything is nasty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So this is what we'll do. We'll be starting a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can give the names. There are so many members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We are starting a petition here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only petition. You can give the... Ask what is this (indistinct) this Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is... Now Brahmānanda has at least given this order that they should be given..., that they be allowed to stay two years. That letter is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I have that letter. That letter says they have come to study Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That letter is there. Also we have a lot of other letters from great...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Indians should send a petition to the government that "We want this movement here. We are separated from our culture. A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami has brought this..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say mobilising the Indians in America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...and that's the most important thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a most important thing. That you cannot discriminate minority communities. That is against American constitution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda, when this, when we had a similar situation in Germany, what we wanted to do is have all our centers in important cities in foreign countries all over the world make a letter and a delegation to visit the United States embassy in all these places. This will have an effect because if it's brought, if it comes in this way, international reaction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, arrange like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can understand, Rāmeśvara suggested we send a big petition of telegrams to the American consulate. Because then American consulate will transmit these telegrams to the state department in Washington. We said that if our... We would pay for it but our life members will all sign if we send a telegram to the American...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, Dr. Saligram taken a leading part?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Dr. Saligram Sukla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Saligram Sukla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In America? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a learned scholar and he is influential man in educational circles. There are many Indians you'll find, they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we can mobilise all the Indians, that's the best process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Indian opinion. I have already given suggestion. The Indians should come forward. And from here also, similar if the member... Respectable Indian businessmen they should say that this Kṛṣṇa cult is very, very old, genuine and we are so enlightened that Swami Bhaktivedanta has taken this movement to the foreign countries. We are so proud, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We want to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is a fact. Everyone is feeling proud. Take all signature of the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> here, influential, that this is genuine. Prove there, that it is genuine movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And we have letters from Swami Premananda and all the (indistinct) from Bombay, and sent all these to Rāmeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone should join. Now people are taking this cultural movement so seriously and if our Indian leaders sleep, that is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, I have... One boy in Delhi went to the British Embassy High Commission, and saw a British paper and even in the British paper the American court case was covered. Headline was "Hare Kṛṣṇa..." I have the paper. Even in the British paper it had a prominent display.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Probably be in German papers too...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. In fact you would probably expect that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> British paper. What does it say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were covering this court case. They had a nice prominent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They have taken it. Now, they are after intelligent person. They are... That has been expressed by this gentleman that it is going like epidemic. They must (indistinct). That is their feeling. That Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading so fast, like epidemic, we must take some steps. That is already, they have expressed their feeling. And you said that in Australia, there one man said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, psychiatrist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that if the people take to this movement, then where you stand? (about Hari-śauri:) He has also expressed. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a psychiatrist (indistinct). Sydney city council are trying to have us banned from the city altogether and they took us to court and we didn't contest the case and they lost. And then afterwards they, they worked out they spent $10,000 and so much manpower to try and get rid of us and it didn't work. And one newspaper man went to a psychiatrist and he asked him, "Can you explain why this huge reaction against just a few people singing and dancing in the street? So he said, "Basically it's because the city-dwellers feel very threatened by our simple lifestyle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just see. So this whole western civilization is threatened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are afraid of the Kṛṣṇa conscious movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Their whole economic structure will fail. Theoretically, take it for granted that if people give up meat-eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No smoking, no drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then whole civilization finished. Even theoretically taken, no smoking, no gambling, no intoxication, no illicit sex, their whole civilization is finished. Lord Zetland said... Not only that, one Sir Valentine Chiro (?), I think, Sir Valentine Chiro, British, important, when Gandhi started non-cooperation. So he remarked that "If Gandhi's movement, this non-cooperation movement is one percent successful, then we will have to leave it." And actually that happened. Because they were ruling over India by Indian cooperation. Gandhi struck to the right point, non-cooperation, and he scented the danger, and he remarked at that time, that if one percent of the Indian people non-cooperate then we are, our British empire finished. So there are intelligent persons, they are thinking in their own way that this movement is so strong against this modern material civilization, if it is allowed to spread then our whole civilization, whole economic structure will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What they're doing now, these parents are getting in contact with devotees who have blooped, and they're getting these devotees to make statements against us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. They are living peacefully in a villa in Paris so happily that ah... Some, one gentleman came to see me "Swamiji, you are preaching against meat-eating, this cannot be done in this country, then we will starve." I said "No, you will never starve. You take this formula." (laughs) So they are thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the most dangerous point is that young men are taking part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The future of the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means it will continue. Young men they take anything very seriously. So this movement is threatening the-what is called?-the foundation of material civilization in the western countries. That's a fact. The foundation is threatened. Their whole foundation is this: meat-eating, illicit sex, gambling and intoxication. They have no other formula. Lord Zetland, when he was asking one of my godbrothers, that "Can you make me <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?"</span> So "Yes, why not? You follow." He said "It is impossible for us. It is impossible for us. And we are no one(?)." That's a fact. If some percentage of the population, European and American population, take it seriously, then it will be dangerous for their government, their economic situation, that's a fact. That, our Sudāmā Vipra is saying that, theatrical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sudāmā Swami is in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sudāmā Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha! And whole situation is threatened. Caitanya Mahāprabhu movement. Have you seen that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Kali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The purport of the play is that this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is threatening to all the associates of <span class="Italic">pāpa.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He, Rāmeśvara told me last night, is completely against these so-called religious movements like ours and he has written personal letters to the parents of all the people who have joined, all those who would write to him, that these types of movements should be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The young men should form another party, all the American young men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Viṣṇu party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Viṣṇu party. Yes. Now they should take in politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You wrote in your Eighth Canto, there are always two parties, the Viṣṇu party and the demons' party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If they're forming demons' party, let them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Form a Viṣṇu party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That ah, the fight between the Viṣṇu party and the demon party is always going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well they could never stop it, I mean... they could just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is in the hands of the young men. It is not possible for them to stop it. If, had it been a sentiment of some retired, just like other thing, that Vivekananda's, all these old fools and rascals, they assemble and meditate. It is not that. They are active. It is not so-called meditation, and snoring, (makes snoring sound) meditating! It is not that. I have seen, all these rascals go, yogis, they prescribe meditation, and meditation means sleeping and snoring, that's all. It is not that movement. We are sending in (indistinct), "Come, sell books." It is no question of meditation. Cheating himself and cheating others. What he will meditate and he requires so many primary rules and regulations before meditating, not that... In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> before meditation it is clearly stated one should not close the eyes. As soon as you close the eyes and meditate, you will sleep. Immediately. They should be half closed and concentrate your eyesight on the top of the nose. That is meditation. Not that closing and snoring and huhuh. These rascals are going on. Who cares for the genuine thing? Nobody cares. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> (indistinct). That "I am your guru, I have followers," <span class="Italic">dharma</span> principle, but he does not know this. This is going on. Neither the rascal guru knows neither his disciple knows. This is going on. Everywhere this is going on. All bluff. This very word used, <span class="Italic">adharma</span> (indistinct), get a plan, "That I am (indistinct)." That's all. And have it, that's all, and do nothing, that's all. I do not know nothing but (indistinct), that's all. All these gurus all these <span class="Italic">chelas</span> are doing that. This Anandamayi, Sai Baba, this, that, so many. What do they know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is why these leaders are getting confused, so many bogus people are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That should, action should be there. If we come out successful in this, how you say, messing, and that will be very good. It is called that, messing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mixing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Mixing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not mixing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (indistinct) together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Messing, that what is called? <span class="Italic">Chaduni?</span> What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sifting?</div>

They are Christians and we are Kṛṣṇians. And actually from Kṛṣṇian, the Christian has come. Yes. Kṛṣṇa, ah, Kristo, there is Greek word and Kristo, is broken spelling of Kṛṣṇa. In India we say one is, one name say is Kṛṣṇa, at least in Bengali we say Kṛṣṭa. Kṛṣṭa. This Kṛṣṭa word is come Kṛṣṇa. And from Kṛṣṭa, Christ has come. This is original root, Kṛṣṇa.

Theoretically they are taking that "If these four things are stopped then where is our civilization?" Where (do) we stand? Meat-eating, they have all over the world millions of slaughterhouse.

Now all of you should come forward. That you do. Admitting (Hindi conversation). They are concerned with the Kṛṣṇa cult. Kṛṣṇa cult means all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> either Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka or anyone, they should combine together.

All the Vaiṣṇavas of different <span class="Italic">sampradāyas,</span> especially Gauḍīya <span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> you should come forward to fight this. They are gathering their strength. We should gather our strength. Fight, Kṛṣṇa never said that "Don't fight." (He) never said (to) Arjuna that "You are My devotee, you don't fight.

Formerly they were thinking that so many swamis and yogis come, come and go. But now they are feeling the strength, they (are) charging that their young men are being kidnapped. It is strong party. And these boys, they have taken to Vaiṣṇava principles, their parents have tried to take them back and induce them to eat meat and according.... They deny. This is also tried. I have got many disciples, they are coming out very rich family, rich father. So one of the fathers called his son that "I am old man, the business is dwindling, you come and take..." So I told him that "You go. Why not take your father's business and use it for Kṛṣṇa?" So he went, on my order. The father wanted him to eat meat. So he denied that "I cannot do that. I can help in your business, but I cannot accept your way of life. That is not possible." Then the father saw, "Then he is lost, useless. If he's not adopting our life..." So there, that one father, now the all fathers have combined that "Our children are now lost. They do not come home, what to speak of adopting again our way of life." They cannot accept the way of life, meat-eating and.... That is not possible. That they're finding dangerous. And other movement they join and they come back. They remain what they are. Simply they say that "I belong to this grouping." But our is different. Not only he belongs to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement but a different type of life. (reads something) Mm. Give it.

If Kṛṣṇa is fighting, why not Kṛṣṇa consciousness the same thing. You cannot expect peaceful life. No, there must be fighting, then think "That is Kṛṣṇa's presence, His fight." So this fighting means they're feeling the presence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Otherwise why they're (indistinct) fight? Had it been an insignificant thing, there was no question of fighting. (Hindi) The gun, howitzer gun, what is that? German, some gun they will go from this part of, this side of English Channel to other. Calais, the other side Calais?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Calais.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calais in France. So from France to other side English Channel, London, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Artillery guns?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they... Hitler invented. The gun will be fired from this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Big, huge gun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this gun is required not for killing a mosquito. (laughter) Big enemy. So they are preparing this big gun and not the mosquito and this Mahesh Yogi and this yogi. You see. They are mosquitoes. For them they don't require any gun. So for big enemy, big gun, you see. They are preparing big gun, that means Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is big enemy. It is not mosquito. So you remain a big enemy, you don't become a mosquito. That is wanted. Immediately arrange this meeting here. Call all the Vaiṣṇavas, all. (Hindi to end)</div>
