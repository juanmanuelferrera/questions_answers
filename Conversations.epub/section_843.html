<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yeah, he's floating around somewhere doing nonsense. Now he's eating meat. (Prabhupāda chuckles) And this one boy in Fiji wrote me a letter. His friend worked at the hotel, Guru Maharaj-ji came and stayed there, and he was a waiter. For dinner, Guru Maharaj-ji had shrimp curry and then beer. Drinking, eating meat, and having illicit sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's his <span class="Italic">līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Complete nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> How does he keep followers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So followers are like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like guru, like <span class="Italic">celā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's a very cheap thing. Very much they're moving on the group spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's just a personality cult with no philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Social club.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, for the <span class="Italic">abhiṣeka,</span> do we require cow urine and cow dung and tail of cow? Is it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If available, not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, we can get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> It's available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're feeling threatened by our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> parties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said that some of the town councils are trying to pass laws against our chanting in the streets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The Christians are behind it in Whangarei.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, can they pass such law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I don't think so. We're having.... Some of our men are going to meet with the council the day after tomorrow at the meeting. They're open to our side. The reason is that the businessmen have complained, some of the businessmen have complained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not all of them. You take some signature from other businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You present that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. The men who are going to speak are businessmen, devotees. One is an architect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he can organize so many signatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> One is a restaurant owner, and one has a hairdressing salon. And they're going to speak...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone likes; that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> We gave the argument before that they say it is a disturbance, but there are so many cars and airplanes which are making disturbance. They should also be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Last week we wrote letters to the newspaper, and they published them, showing our view. And in Whangarei.... It's another city, a hundred miles from here. It's near the farm up north, and the devotees chant there. And the businessmen complained. And the devotees wrote a letter criticizing the materialistic businessmen, and that they didn't care for the people, only they wanted money. And they printed it this big in the newspaper, completely criticizing, and the people liked it. They put it in everything, word for word what the devotees said. So it was good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is agitation against chanting. That is also good. Yes, "Hare Kṛṣṇa is bad." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't want to be bothered with Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't want to be bothered with Hare Kṛṣṇa. Go on with their hellish life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we want that. Let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa somehow or other. (devotees laugh) "We don't want to be bothered by Hare Kṛṣṇa." That means chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Because our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party now, we have, we go on <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> eighty men. We go two nights a week with eighty men. Huge <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> with five <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas</span> and guitars, and we get huge crowd from the whole street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will make you triumphant. Go on <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> That is very nice. <span class="Italic">Kīrtana,</span> and book distribution. This is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> This is <span class="Italic">bṛhad mṛdaṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So do it enthusiastically. Keep yourself pure. Nobody will be able to do any harm to you. Kṛṣṇa will give you protection. So? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Eight <span class="Italic">crores</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Didn't he say eighty <span class="Italic">crores</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One <span class="Italic">crore</span> means ten million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Eighty million rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's a million dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eight million dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it will be tested how much money we have got. (Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Ghee</span> is cheaper in New Zealand than in Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, first of all arrange for selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I've already sent off the letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you can disvertise(?) it from New Zealand or from Australia. There can be very peaceful condition of the whole world. Simply mismanaged by the rascal leaders. Otherwise, people can live very peacefully, eat sumptuously, save time, and there is no necessity of stopping the bare necessities of life. There is arrangement for eating, sleeping, sex life also. But not like fools and rascals. Like sane man. But this modern civilization, it is insane, crazy civilization. There is a little pleasure in sex life-simply sex life, increase sex life, spoiling everything. That is crazy. Eating-eat anything, any nonsense thing, and become a hog. Sleeping-oḥ, there is no limit, twenty-four hours sleeping if it is possible. Go on, this is going on. Eating, sleeping, mating. And defense-and discover atomic weapon, this weapon, that weapon, and kill innocent persons, unnecessarily, defense. This is going on. But everything can be used properly for peaceful condition, and when you become peaceful, no disturbance, then you can very happily chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and your life becomes successful. This is our program. We don't want to stop anything. How it can be stopped? Whatever is the bare neces.... Just like we have taken <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> What is that? "Oh, we have no sex life only. Otherwise, we are also eating, we are also sleeping." So that is also stopped in good old age. In old age, if a person like me, at the age of eighty years, if I would have shopped for sex life, does it look very good? Young men, they are allowed. That's all right. But a young..., old man is going to the club and spending for sex life so much money. Therefore younger generation, they're allowed <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life from twenty-five years to fifty years. That's all. After that, stop sex life. Actually, they want to stop population. Then why it, sex, then? No, they'll have sex life, at the same time, no population, kill the children. What is that? Simply sinful life. They will suffer, continue to suffer. So we want to stop that suffering. These rascals, they do not understand. They think, "Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is disturbing." A rascal civilization. So let us try our best. What can be done? You also helping in this movement. So don't spoil the movement by manufacturing ideas. Don't do that. Go on in the standard way, keep yourself pure; then movement is sure to be successful. But if you want to spoil it by whimsical, then what can be done? It will be spoiled. If you manufacture whims and disagree and fight amongst yourself, then it will be another edition of these so-called movements. It will lose the spiritual strength. Always remember it. You cannot.... Now, actually, people are surprised: "What this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> has got power that it is changing so quickly?" And on the other hand, it is to be admitted, unless it has got power, how it is changing? So we have to keep that power. Don't make it an ordinary musical vibration. It is a different thing, spiritual. Although it seems like musical vibration, but it is spiritual, completely. <span class="Italic">Mantrauśadhi-vaśa.</span> Even, by <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> the snakes can be charmed. So <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is not ordinary sound vibration. So we have to keep the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> in potency, potent, by offenseless chanting, by remaining pure. If you pollute the <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> then it will lose its effect. (devotees discuss some money matters in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So concerning the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I talked to some boys, and the one boy, Dhūmra(?), he used to be in Australia, he made a fifteen-foot-high Lord Caitanya. Do you remember at the Ratha-yātrā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> And we're going to build a temple with nice domes, Indian style, and with sculpture like the elephant heads...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make in Vṛndāvana style.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. I'll get pictures of the different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is that big dome and.... You have seen Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I have seen it just before it was finished, not since it was completed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But I've seen pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think we have got pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> And the place where we're going to put it, you'll be able to see it for miles. It'll be a landmark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You can see it for many miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only one, you hundreds of temples construct. Village to village, town to.... At the same time, man. And it will revolutionize the whole rascal situation. At the present moment, it is rascal situation. They're simply satisfied by driving the motor.... <span class="Italic">putputputputputputputputput!</span> (Prabhupāda makes the sound of a roaring motor). They are thinking, "Oh, how highly I am situated." All crazy. But this has been taught to them that "This is civilization. If you have got a motorcycle and you can come like the wild cat, (all laugh) then you are civilized." They are thinking how great civilized they are; we are thinking how wild cat he is. And what is the difference between wild cat and running dog and this motorcycle? <span class="Italic">Put-put?</span> What is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they're taking it, highly civilized way of life. Where you are going? You cannot go beyond this earth. You attempted so much to go to the moon planet, you failed. And where you can go, <span class="Italic">put-put-put-put</span>? You'll have to stay here. But that rascal does not understand. He thinks, "I am going very fast." Where you are going? You are destined to stay here. That he does not understand. Not only this <span class="Italic">put-put</span> motorcycle, the <span class="Italic">put-put</span> airplane also. They're also trying to go to this planet around, round. That sputnik, first sputnik, eighteen thousand miles, and they simply rounded over the world in one hour and twenty-five minutes. And where did you go? And when he's tired, then come down again. They cannot understand, these so-called scientists, that we cannot go in this way. There is higher authority. Why it will allow us to go anywhere? Just like the horse running fast, but within the race course. That's all. It cannot go beyond the race course. And similarly, however heroic expedition we may show, you are, what is called, <span class="Italic">baddha-jīva,</span> conditioned. You cannot cross the condition, that is not possible. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> A rascal, on account of his false prestige, he is thinking, "Oh, I am independent. I can do whatever I like." <span class="Italic">Vimūḍhātmā,</span> foolish, rascal. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha,</span> not. <span class="Italic">Vimūḍhātmā,</span> "especially the rascal, a special rascal." Ordinary rascal is better than the special rascal. (laughs) So all these scientists, philosophers, and political leaders, they're all special rascal, they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Vimūḍha</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ordinary man, they're simply rascal, and these rascals are special rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Vimūḍhā nānupaśyanti paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Hmm. So don't be <span class="Italic">vimūḍhas.</span> Better remain <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Not special rascal. (end)</div>
