<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's a type of pandanus. They weave with that, Prabhupāda. They make rugs. [break] ...<span class="Italic">chiku</span> tree, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chikel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yeah, this one here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> <span class="Italic">Chiku.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">chiku?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Like in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The brown fruit, <span class="Italic">chiku.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">chiku.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Na, na, this is not <span class="Italic">chiku.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This one right here. This big one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Oh, the big one. Yeah, that is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is well known, <span class="Italic">chiku.</span> In Gujarat there is ample <span class="Italic">chiku.</span> This stone is artificially brought here, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It looks natural. It looks like it was here all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...small trees in here or grass, we can walk in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Oh, this way. We can walk this way. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It's an acknowledgement of the first director of this botanical garden. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...poison, Prabhupāda. This one is poison. It's called aki (a key?) apple. I think, I don't know, but I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without tasting, you say poison? First of all taste. (laughter) If you die, then you say it is poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is a candlenut tree, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They take these nuts and in old Hawaii they string it through a coconut frond, and then they light it, and it used to burn for a few minutes. It's full of oil. Candlenut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What it is written there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> "Sir Betare (?) tree."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They told me most of the fruits here are poisonous except for one mango.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That yellow kind of <span class="Italic">campaka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not <span class="Italic">campaka.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">kaiku(?).</span> [break] ...Melbourne?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> What's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They have a park, a botanical garden in Melbourne where we went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very big and very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> There there were no fruit trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> In Melbourne there were no fruit trees. Here there are many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But here the poison fruit. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He says poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is better not to have fruit tree than to have a poison fruit tree. What is for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> To protect it from the sun, too much sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is a cinnamon tree over here, a cinnamon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Cinnamon tree, you can use the leaves for cooking. <span class="Italic">Teja-patra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Bay leaves. Aren't they called bay leaves? A dry one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Where is the cinnamon stick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It says it's from India and Ceylon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's little berries on it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Various sweet berry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Blueberry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Java berry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Where's the path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In either direction, you know, they're all different plants. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...say "This contains this chemical, that chemical, this chemical," but he will never think who has put this chemical. That is his dullness. They will analyze and say, "It contains this chemical, that chemical, that..." And who has put this chemical? That they cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Very large trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This big one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe thousand years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's from Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> African trees are like tall like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> One hundred years, it's more than hundred years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> This is that same one. They give red, different flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also African?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, they have in India this tree also. That gives red flowers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it was in a small seed. Prepare such seed, you chemist. How strong!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, here, from that tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It says, they put it in mattresses and pillows a long time ago. They used that for their bedding. It's called (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We have also in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We make thread out of it. It is called cotton wool. We can sit down here? [break] ...Zamindar, very rich man, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. [break] ...cars, but where their men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There is a Buddhist temple here, Chinese Buddhist temple, and I think the cars are for that. And some of the keepers. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...be superintend when the garden opens. [break] ... saw the question, but he cannot answer. So he began to write words like this, whole book, and the examiners saw that it has no meaning. But he has coined so many words. They said, "Very intelligent." They passed him. (laughter) Now, "upperfluous." You don't find all these words in dictionary. "Upperfluous rain of agua was dogbendikulali gondolized by lacticism of wine." It appears very gramatically nice composed, but it has no meaning. So he coined such words, a full book. Because he could not answer. So the time was there. He began to coin words. And he was passed, for his intelligence. Similarly, these people are putting words which you cannot understand, and they are getting their salaries, that's all. [break] ...invent something, that they will not die, there will be no disease, there will be no old age. That is something. What is this nonsense, simply speculating? [break] The cloud is standing there. It is not systematic. Then why the gravitation is not working? There are millions and millions tons of water. Why the gravitation is not working? The law of gravitation, why it is not working? Don't work with a rod.(?) What is the answer? They are not systematic changing. Why? Why the gravitation is not working, fall down? They are heavy, very heavy when they, what is called... Agitation. What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Friction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Friction, yes. There is so much sound. So why it is not falling down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The scientist says the pull of gravitation starts only so high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is not working in all heights? Then what is their theory? If it is working under certain condition, who made this condition? [break] ...the nature, "Now you get down these islands. Get(?) the water," can they do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how they will come to know? [break] ...Kṛṣṇa wants, immediately this land, by earthquake, can go down, immediately, within a second. So in the Vedic literature nature is accepted. But the creation, maintenance, destruction, that is in the hand of God, not nature. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> ...used to say that they can control the weather. They used to make big propaganda, "We are now going to control."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another foolish propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Now they have given up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see? They want to draw some salary, big salaries, by bluffing the government and the public. This is their business. They are failing. They have finished their business on this planet; now they are going another planet. These are nonsense. [break] They know that "We... So as far as possible, we have bluffed. Now our business in this planet is finished. So let us go to another planet." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Even if they wanted to stop this space project, they couldn't stop because they've already spent billions of dollars for making equipment and rocket ships and launching pads and rocket bases and so many employees. If they stop, then so much would be wasted, so many people would be unemployed. So they have to continue even if they know that it's a bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the way of falsehood. If once you speak something false, then to protect that falsehood you have to take to so many other falsehoods. This is the way of falsehood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> One lie leads to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...are going to Venus, Americans and Russians combined together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> This summer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, in the summer. Venus is very cold? Why they have selected summer season? (laughter) [break] ...could not go to the moon, and Venus is far above moon. How they will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They're not going to Venus, are they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Are they going to Mars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, they're just going around the earth, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yeah, they're linking up in space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Prabhupāda, when they said they went to the moon and they showed films of them landing and walking on the moon, was this all a bluff?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, here they... All laboratory work, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They all made it up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Prabhupāda, they are not going to go to Venus. The American and Russian, they are just going to meet outside the earth. They are not going to any planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It is too difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They're going to meet in space and float around in space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is birds are doing also. What is the credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They are thinking that "What is the use of going to any other planet, because there is no life on the other planets."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why no life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they have photographs and things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Photograph, what is this nonsense photograph? How long it can go up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They're taken from hundreds of miles up in space, and then they say there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is hundreds of miles? It is, er, forty billion, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Four billion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four billion. So how they can calculate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If they took a photograph of the earth planet from up in space, they would probably also say there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say because the atmosphere is not like this planet, others cannot live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not atmosphere? The moon planet, there is a planet. There is space. There is surface. There is dust. So why not atmosphere the same? It is made of the same ingredients, earth, water, fire. Why do you say that is not same atmosphere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They are saying that it's too cold or too hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That is here also. There are many cold places. Do they think that in the cold places there is no life? All nonsense. And only nonsense will believe them. I never believed it. Why? Here we see under this sand there is life. The crabs, what is called? They live within, so many hundreds of thousands. We have seen on the sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And the polar bears for cold season for living in mounds of snows and all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are birds, some birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Penguins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Penguins birds. There is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Seals, whales, polar bears...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is life everywhere. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">sarva-gaḥ.</span> The life is there everywhere. And moon planet, according to our Vedic literature, that is one of the demigods' place. People live there <span class="Italic">daiva</span> age, ten thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They will not believe in the demigods...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I will not believe them. That's all, finished. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They cannot see them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can you see, teeny eyes? What can you see? Can you see what is there on the other side of the sea? Then does it mean there is nothing? Your nonsense seeing. Why you are believing of seeing? Your seeing power is very, very limited. Why do you believe in seeing? That is childish, "I cannot see." What you can see? First of all, let us consider this point. You cannot see anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, people will be very surprised to find out that the moon is farther away from us than the sun when they read your..., when they read Fifth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But at least, they could not go there. Otherwise, why they are giving up this job? They could not go there. That's a fact. Their plan was to... They were selling land even on the moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Selling land on the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They were selling airline tickets also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. (laughter) Just see, route. Pan American, yes. They sold so many tickets. Such fools there are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In New York sometimes people sell new immigrants the Brooklyn Bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Moscow Sea. They pitched one flag in the moon planet and named Moscow Sea. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Just like you said that this moon and other planets are also made of these five elements-earth, water, fire, ether-they brought a rock from there. So they are accepting that the moon is made of those elements also. But they are not accepting that life is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they'll not accept. Therefore... therefore fools. Why? The circumstance is the same. Why there should be no life? That is foolishness. We have got experience. As soon as there is water, there is life. As soon as there is land, there is life. As soon as there is air, there is life. So where is life? No life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They may agree in undeveloped species, but as far as higher forms of life, they will not agree, such as humans or demigods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that also we cannot agree. If there are lower species, there must be higher species. As we see here is dog also, man also, higher species, lower species, why not there? They can talk all nonsense, but a nonsense will believe. No sane man will believe. [break] ...going to meet in the space?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> It's a diplomatic move. They feel it will make friendly relationships between the two countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They cannot meet on the earth and they are going to meet on the... (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am the only man in the world challenging that "You have not gone to the moon planet." Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is it possible there's some difference as to the definition of what the moon planet is? They will say that the moon planet is that planet out there. Do we agree? At night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your definition? First of all let me hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I'm still wondering myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our definition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What do we call those planets that rotate around Jupiter and Saturn and... They will say those are also moons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Different planets, different position. Just like this sun planet is fiery. There is fire. Similarly, in moon planet there is fire, but it is surrounded by cold atmosphere. Therefore it is cooling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So that's the specific characteristic of this moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which moon? Yes, this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Our moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the other moons that rotate around Saturn and Jupiter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other moon? There is no other moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So they're just planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The moon is not rotating around the earth. The moon is further away than the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The moon is further away than the sun. Wow! (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Why does it seem like the moon is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seen? Who has seen it? First of all let me..., who has seen it? (Devotees are laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's nothing you can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Prabhupāda, you said the other day that pretty soon all these lies will be exposed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are already exposed because they have left that expedition. That means they are hopeless. That is exposed. But foolish people will not ask them that "Why you have stopped this expedition?" They will again go on bluffing, and they will accept. That is the position. Now people should ask them, "Why you have stopped moon expedition and Venus expedition? You proposed you were going there, making arrangement. Why you have stopped?" It is failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They might argue...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the argument? You have stopped. That is your failure, that's all. You can argue to the laymen, foolish men, but we will say you have stopped; therefore it is failure. All bogus propaganda is now stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They are saying the moon isn't worth develop...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they cannot say anything because they are failure. Anything they say, that is all foolishness. They cannot say anything. Once you are failure, you have no value, anything you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I've heard the argument that when they are going to the moon, they are always in contact, bouncing off these sonar waves and radar waves off the moon's surface, and when they are coming near, they can even see from their little portholes the moon's surface, the same moon that they see on the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say all nonsense. That's all. (chuckles) Why the earth is not brilliant at night like the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It depends on where you are. It depends on where you are looking from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Where you are" means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have pictures from the moon taken of the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pictures? First of all you see. Then take picture. You cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They use all these things to argue that they actually did go to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning of argument if they have stopped? That is failure. Don't talk nonsense anymore. <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span> By the result we have to understand. Your result is you are failure. Then what is the use of talking nonsense? Stop this nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> It's like five years ago they declared a war on cancer, and they spent billions and billions of dollars on it, and just the other day they now said that it was a complete failure, that the disease has just kept on growing and growing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You cannot stop even cancer disease and you are controlling nature. Just see their (?) false, puffed up. They cannot control one disease, and they are going to control nature. We have to believe that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He just told me I was spaced out because I wasn't punching this in, but I'm still astounded by the fact that the moon is further away than the sun. When the devotees hear this tape, they're not going to believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they could not go. I... First of all I said that they might have gone to the Rahu planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, the Fourth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all my conviction: they have gone nowhere. They have simply stayed in their laboratory, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Anyone can do that, bring some pictures and bring a rock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think somebody might have told you before, but there was a big scandal right after the moon shot when they said they went to the moon and..., that it was all staged in the desert of Arizona, that they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> When Puruṣottama heard that, he blooped. (Devotees continue laughing.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In 1968 I was questioned by the reporters, "What is your opinion about this moon?" "It is simply a waste of time and energy, that's all. It is all false propaganda." I told to the reporter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually, these scientists and philosophers, they become very famous and popular by coming up with some brand new theories. So why don't we widely publicize our theories?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> [break] ...real information about the moon from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Veda. Veda</span> means knowledge. What is this? Some animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Fish. It has those horns, spines, so that no one can bother it. Protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It's a porcupine fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Blowfish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They blow up like a ball. When someone comes to them, they expand very large.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> And their spines stick out straight. It's very dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Poisonous. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It's twenty-five before seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, do we say that they've gone to Rahu simply to placate them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, accidentally they went to Rahu. Maybe. That is also not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> [break]...gone at all outside this atmosphere of earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...haven't gone to moon planet, that is my... [break] ...why they will give it up? That is the proof. America was found by Columbus. So many people came from Europe and utilized it. So if they would have gone to moon planet, they would have utilized it. But they have not gone. That is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That was their original proposal, that they can utilize it, make colonies there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> The moon exploration, because they thought that we cannot use the moon like Columbus, they used America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your excuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say it's too much like the desert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's cause they were in the desert. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...grow so many nice dates, you know that? You cannot say in the desert there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, yes. Arabia they grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. [break] ...desert nice watermelon will grow. Yes. Nice dates. So people go there, take the dates and take the watermelon. Kṛṣṇa has provided food even there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Would one see gross form on a subtle planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Like the moon planet is heavenly planet. They're supposed to have subtle bodies there. So would there be any gross forms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why subtle body? That is material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So we would not be able to see any traces of a civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is civilization. You have not gone there, rascal. You are simply imagining. (Devotees laugh) There is civilization. First thing is, you rascal, you did not go. You are talking only nonsense. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> [break] ...Rahu planet, that's a hellish planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They might have gone to that hellish planet. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No wonder they left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That seems more befitting them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They were not qualified to go to the moon, so Kṛṣṇa sent them there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are not qualified. Even in this planet, unless one is bona fide, he is not allowed to enter America. How you can go to the moon planet? That is demigods' planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Some of the astronauts became very religious after they supposedly went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are intelligent, that "This is all nonsense. Real thing is God." That is... They come to their senses. They are intelligent. [break] (In car:) ...real business is to enhance your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These people, they are wasting time simply to know something else. There is no limit. <span class="Italic">Kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> What is moon planet? What business you have got to know the...? Whatever is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> accept it, that's all. What is the use of experiment and going there and then again say, "Oh, it is all failure." Simply waste of time. The arrangement is there by God. That's all. Spending so much money, hard-earned money, unnecessarily and then say, "Oh, it is failure."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If they were a little bit intelligent and had some knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they would learn that they could go there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The knowledge is already there. Just like I am speaking. I am not a scientist. On the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes. Just like you have said in the <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets,</span> you can go there by the mystic yoga process. You don't have to make some space machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The scientists want to go there without performing any kind of austerities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is austerities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, actually they end up performing greater austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to earn money with so much labor and spend it for nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Billions of dollars. Some of them are working like madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They work all day and most of the night. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...expedition is exposition of the scientists: useless. But these materialistic persons will be cheated again and again. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> The scientists will propose something else and they will accept. They will never say that "You are failure in your moon expedition. Why you are proposing again something nonsense?" They will never ask. They will pay me, "Yes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> The government doesn't want the people in general to know that the scientists are failures because they feel that the people will be put into a lot of anxiety because of this. So they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are already in anxiety. This material world means anxiety. So many problems there are. <span class="Italic">Sadā samudvigna-dhiyāṁ asad-grahāt [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they accepted this material world as all in all, <span class="Italic">samudvigna,</span> they are full of anxiety. Just like if you are on a boat and if you know that after some hours the boat will be drowned, then can you remain without anxiety?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They have some relief, though, because they think that the scientists will be able to protect them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their position. This is their position. Just like we are in this car, but we know it, that any moment there can be accident. So how we can be without anxiety? In the material world, on account of this material condition, we are not going to stay here. There must be anxiety. But if we close our eyes, that is different thing. Otherwise it is full of anxiety. [break] "... be free from anxiety, then surrender to Me. What I say, do it." That he will not do. They will manufacture their own way of life. They must be in anxiety. They will never hear what Kṛṣṇa says. And our propaganda is that "Just you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, and you will be happy." This is our... That they will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> ...'60, 1960. When did they start to go to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> I think President Kennedy started the program in 1960.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sending dog first of all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yeah, mice and then monkeys and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...desert. But here we find, within the desert, petrol. Why not get petrol there and solve your power problem. Can I not raise this question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> How would they get it back from the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will be petrol. You take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> How would they get it back here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As they are coming. They are going and coming. So let them go, and if the surface is desert, then find out oil within.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But their answer would be: "Well, even if we found oil, it would be impossible to bring it to the earth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They can make up tanks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can make devices, fill it up, and throw it. (laughter) [break] ...mad, you should give them mad suggestion. (laughter) (end)</div>
