<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, this is not him. This is a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Professor's upstairs putting on a <span class="Italic">dhotī.</span> He brought his daughter. Professor Chenique teaches a course in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> at the University, and he is also doing translations of Śaṅkarācārya and teaches for the Federation of Yoga. He considers himself a Christian Advaitist. [break] ...some questions regarding the publications in French. For example, on the front of <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine, in the English edition and other language editions, they have kept the phrase "Godhead is light, darkness is nescience. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience." Now in French it is difficult to translate that. There is no word <span class="Italic">Godhead.</span> And if you say "God is light," in French it sounds very impersonalist. In French, <span class="Italic">Dieux est lumiere,</span> "God is light." Many groups say like that. We use the word Godhead, and that distinguishes us from the other groups. Now is the phrase very important, and do you want us to keep it on the front of the magazine? It should be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a little difference between God and Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So when we will have to try to find...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ. Īśvara,</span> more or less everyone, but <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ,</span> that is Godhead. The Māyāvādīs, they do not distinguish between one <span class="Italic">īśvara</span> to another <span class="Italic">īśvara.</span> That may be on the ordinary level, but there is <span class="Italic">parama īśvara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> One possibility would be to say God the Supreme Person is light. That we can translate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God means Supreme Person. But these <span class="Italic">advaitavādī,</span> Māyāvādīs, they have made God everyone. God means Supreme Person, that is the dictionary word. "Supreme Being." That is the dictionary meaning. God does not mean ordinary, but they have made ordinary, anyone God. "I am God, you are God, he is God." Then what is meaning of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Therefore we say God<span class="Italic">head</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Head man. There are many men, he is the head man. Godhead word is also there in the dictionary. You find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "Godhead-being God or a God divine nature, Deity, the Godhead, God." The word is there, but the definition they've given is not very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know. They do not know what is God, what is Godhead. They think all these are fictitious. Throughout the whole world they do not know what is God. Simply they know the word, that's all. What it means they do not know. That we are giving. Here is God. Godhead. Nobody knows, nobody cares to know. That is nescience. They think it is an idea, that's all. Actually there is God, there is kingdom of God, one can go and speak with Him, dance with Him. They cannot believe there are... It is beyond their poor fund of knowledge. Therefore they do not accept Kṛṣṇa as God. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> God is the Supreme Person, Supreme Being. Actually there is place where God lives. They do not know. This is first time, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are giving these ideas; otherwise, who knows it? Nobody knows it. The Christian or Muhammadan is... Nobody knows. And religion means to accept God as the Supreme Person. They do not know God. Then what is meaning of religion? Religion means to accept a Supreme Person as the supreme controller. That is religion. How the Supreme Person is working in manufacturing this flower, let the scientists explain. There is no brain? Just nicely painted, symmetrically, each flower of the same class; another class, another class, another class. (guests enters) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is Professor Francois Chenique and his daughter. They drove from Paris this morning to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. You can come forward. I have read your review of our book. It is very nice. (translation is given) Very nice. Your study about this tradition, Indian tradition, I think he has mentioned. Indian tradition, the whole Vedic literature... He understands English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, but I should translate, he's asked me to translate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is to approach God. This is the Indian tradition. But, as you have mentioned Aurobindo's name, Aurobindo's idea was to make a better situation of this world. He wanted by yoga practice, a better situation of the world. But our tradition says that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He asks what is meant by the situation in this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The situation is you have to suffer. Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is a place for suffering, and that also you cannot stay here. Even if you make compromise, "All right, I shall suffer and stay," Kṛṣṇa says no. You suffer, and after you make adjustment, you will be kicked out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He said do we have to completely leave the world? We cannot stay within the world and sanctify ourselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to leave, you cannot stay. You do not want to leave, that's a fact, but you'll be kicked out. When Napoleon fought for France, he did not like to leave, but he was kicked out. I have seen in one park, there is a Napoleon Bonaparte there, France and Napoleon identified. But France is there, Napoleon is kicked out. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's asking that in view of that, is it possible to live a household life and at the same time a spiritual life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Arjuna, Arjuna is a householder, he's a military man, but the greatest devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He wants you to mention something about the translations. He wants to express his opinion about the translations that the French translators are doing of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He wants to give his opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's asking permission to give his opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It would be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says it is very interesting, very important that <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> be translated in the same way as the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has been translated many times into French, but the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> was only translated once, and that also in the last century.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> No, it's another one. In 1800 it was translated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they simply translation, or elaborately like we are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just translation. Sanskrit on the left-hand page, French on the right-hand page, but no commentaries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is difficult to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It was the full twelve cantos, but a very limited edition, and only available in library archives. No one has..., very few people have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He feels that the French public is very demanding in questions of editing and writing, and he feels that the French that's used in our translations should not, he said, smell of English. Sometimes French translations seem like English written in French. He said those should be in perfect French, and that in the French language there's a need to make things more compact and condensed. He's wondering if we can condense them more than in English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one of us who knows French nicely, he can do that. But there is no difference. They are taking the ideas from English and translating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, Professor Chenique wishes to know, would it not be more valuable if our men spoke Sanskrit and could translate directly from the Sanskrit into French?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no much difference. Sanskrit is there and the Sanskrit translation is there. Where is the difference? We are giving the Sanskrit and then word-to-word translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says that when one translates from Sanskrit into English and from English into French, that it's not exactly the same thing in French that it was in Sanskrit, he feels...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if from Sanskrit to French can be translated, I have no objection. But we have no such arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We have no Sanskrit scholars in French yet, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only scholar, not only scholar, he must be a realized soul. Simply scholars will not help, simply scholarship will not help. There are many Sanskrit scholars in India. There are many Sanskrit scholars, original Sanskrit scholars in India, they cannot understand <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Professor Chenique's point is that we are seeking to introduce these books on a university level, and there's a certain standard that must be met.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's just saying that the style of French, he feels that it's too many words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> French, he must be French, expert in language, at the same time, a devotee. Then he can explain. Otherwise no. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara, he asked that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, bhāgavata paḍā giyā bhāgavata sthāne:(?)</span> "Go and study <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> from <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span>" I have discussed this in the beginning of translation of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> that is the limit of education. <span class="Italic">Vidyā bhāgavata vadhiḥ.(?)</span> One has to study and take education up to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> That is, if one understands <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> he's finished his education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He agrees. He's saying that he wishes-he's not criticizing in any way-but he wants that your books have a better audience, then more people will accept them. And he feels that if the French, the way that the French has been written, is changed, we'll have a better audience, it will reach higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is from scholarship point of view. But our point is this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> must be presented by <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span> And there is no much scholarship required. Just like <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> begins with the words <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> This Sanskrit word means the Absolute Truth is that from where everything emanates. Now that Absolute Truth further explained: <span class="Italic">anvayād itarataś ca abhijñaḥ svarāṭ.</span> That Absolute Truth is aware of everything, directly and indirectly, of all this creation. In this way, if you step-by-step study, it is not very difficult so far the word meanings are concerned, but it is a question of realization. Unless one is realized, he cannot explain properly. That is the secret. Therefore we have given the life of Caitanya Mahāprabhu in our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> because He's living <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janadradhi: :</span>His point, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that your purports, you are repeating teachings, but this is wanted. His point is that in the French language, the French language cannot accept such repetitions. So he's asking if you could compact more your purports. But we want to translate your purports with the repetitions because we know they are wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The English purport that you give very often will repeat one point for a clear understanding to the reader. Stylistically, in French this is difficult. It is not the accepted standard. French is generally more compact, something is said only one time. So Professor Chenique is hoping that he will see in our future translations a better French style in the translation. And Janadradhi, who is the translator, one of our translators, explains that our point is that we wish to keep your intention by repeating the point so that the reader will understand, because it is being said several times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the system in Vedic ways. Just like you see <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> In different way Kṛṣṇa has explained the immortality of the soul. You take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that portion. Find out that. What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> <span class="Italic">Na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Before that. Describes negatively in different ways of understanding the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, positively, negatively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">avināśi tu tad viddhi<br class="calibre2"/>yena sarvam idaṁ tatam<br class="calibre2"/>vināśam avyayasyāsya<br class="calibre2"/>na kaścit kartum arhati</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(reads French translation)</div>
<div class="Verse">antavanta ime dehā<br class="calibre2"/>nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anāśino 'prameyasya<br class="calibre2"/>tasmād yudhyasva bhārata<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(French translation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing is being explained in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> The question seems to be a very technical one of just French language. He's not objecting to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I've no experience of the French language, I'm talking of the Sanskrit language. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> If we give him one purport and see how he would change it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many purports you can. (professor reads one purport in French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> That one was all right. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Chenique:</span> I was, up to recent time, I was commenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the camping. For eleven years every summer I am commenting the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> in the camping. I commend very warmly this edition of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I think it's the best that you may find in France. But when I'm reading the commentary for my students, I find some sentences which are not good French. I think because it is not a very good style, and I hope it won't be that matter with... (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Perhaps Professor Chenique could go over our translations and make any suggestions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Professor Chenique is offering to re-read our publications. To read them and when he sees something he thinks can be corrected, he will make some indication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection. It is welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (devotee enters) This is Hayeśvara. Hayeśvara dāsa, in charge of the Dutch publications, Dutch translator. He has done the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> this edition, in Dutch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> This is the Dutch translation. Professor Chenique made the comment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The idea is, suppose I am in France. I do not know French language, but there is fire in my room, and I have to call my neighbors. So somehow or other I call and take their help. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Professor Chenique wishes to know whether we cannot do one very small pocketbook edition that will sell very inexpensively. Something like I think in India they have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like the abridged version in America they did?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No, something like this, very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection. It is nice proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like that Chinese one? First six chapters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that Chinese?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He feels that if we bring out a very small, compact edition, it will sell very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, we printed seven hundred copies. And now we are going to print five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He said we're making the highest record in distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Chenique:</span> Oh, yes, for this kind of book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission,</div>
<div class="Verse">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He has to preach in every village and every town on the surface of the globe about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So our business is... Just this example I have given, that there is fire. I do not know the language. Still, I have to call and take help. So I am doing like that. There is a story. In Calcutta when the Britishers were establishing themselves, so one clerk was working in the office and some monkey came and scattered the office files and everything. So his boss came, he asked him, "What is this, why you?" So he cannot explain, so he began to jump like monkey, that on account of the monkey coming within the room. So when the language is unknown we have to jump and show that the monkey came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Professor Chenique thanks you very much for receiving him, and he says that he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many thanks for his coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...he is very happy to see you, and he does not have any questions. He appreciates very much the Vaiṣṇava point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take this to the daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> And he thinks that seeing the decline of religion in the West he says it is very important that we are pushing on this mission as we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He doesn't think he'll be able to follow the life of the Vaiṣṇavas, because our life is too difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That attitude will help him. That humbleness, that "I cannot follow," that will help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says he has a tendency more of a <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> and his training has been according to Śaṅkarite and also Buddhist lines. But still he appreciates very much <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> and he is very happy to meet the devotees, and at the same time he's very depressed to meet all these intellectuals who know so many things but cannot understand anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without becoming <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> nobody can become <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> Without knowledge, if one has become <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> he's sentimentalist. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(French translation read) So without becoming fully in knowledge, nobody can become devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He asks, What about the opposite, people becoming devotees without knowing anything? He asking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, devotee cannot be without knowing anything. A devotee means, a devotee means he knows everything. <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> This is Vedic injunction. One who knows the Absolute, he knows everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? That verse, does that mean that one who is neophyte...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neophyte is neophyte. Why do you bring him to become a devotee? A devotee is different. A "one plus one equal to two," he's not mathematician. He's learning. There is hope one day he'll be a big mathematician. There are three stages, <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī, uttama-adhikārī.</span> So when you speak of devotee, that is this <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī.</span> So he knows everything. Rather, the so-called <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> he does not know. Because he does not know Kṛṣṇa. The so-called <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> he does not know what is Personality of Godhead. He's impersonalist. Therefore he is still unaware of the Absolute Truth. Therefore he's not <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> His <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> his knowledge, is lacking. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said,</div>
<div class="Verse">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante<br class="calibre2"/>jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<br class="calibre2"/>vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti<br class="calibre2"/>sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.19]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If one <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> is impersonalist, he's not <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> He is still unaware of the Absolute Truth. He does not know. Therefore it will take many, many births to come to the understanding of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore he's not <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> he's claiming to be <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> Such <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> will take many hundreds of births to come to the position of real <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> Find out this <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So-called <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> after many, many births, when he understands Kṛṣṇa and surrenders to Him, then he's <span class="Italic">jñānī. Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> That kind of <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> is very, very rare. The impersonalist means <span class="Italic">ajñānī.</span> Yes. Because he does not know Kṛṣṇa, the person. There is another verse in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">. Āruhya kṛcchreṇa,</span> by the <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> process, is undergoing austerities and penances, one comes to the platform of <span class="Italic">paraṁ padam,</span> monism, or platform of oneness. But because he has no shelter, he <span class="Italic">patanty adhaḥ,</span> again comes to the material. Just like so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> in India, they are very learned, they have come to the platform of Brahman realization, but after some time they come to the material field for political work, for social work. They give up this world, <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> If <span class="Italic">jagat</span> is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> is false, why does he come for social work? Just like these people going to the moon planet, but because they do not get any shelter, they take some sand and come back again. So what is the use of going there and spending so much money and come back with little sand, and satisfied, "Now we have studied"? Because they have no shelter. So the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they have no shelter. Yes. They may go very high in the sky, but because they have no shelter they come back again. <span class="Italic">Punar muṣaka bhava,</span> again become a mouse. So that is not <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> that is <span class="Italic">ajñānī. Jñānī</span> is described here, <span class="Italic">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">. Brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]</span> is <span class="Italic">jñānī, ahaṁ brahmāsmi. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā,</span> "I have nothing to do with material world." <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">,</span> there is no lamentation, there is no hankering. When he has attained that stage, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta </span>stage, reality, then he is entrance in the <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise a neophyte.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says that any person on the path of knowledge who rejects the Personality of Godhead, his knowledge is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sublime knowledge. When you talk with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, dance with, that is sublime perfection. Otherwise, you will have to dance with the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's asking that since he first read the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> when he was very young, since that time he's been trying to compact paths of <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and follow the teachings of all the great religions. And he's wondering if he should continue on that same path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> means that to understand the Absolute Truth. If you do not understand the Absolute Truth, what is the meaning of this <span class="Italic">jñāna</span>? That means knowledge is imperfect. But if you want to know the Absolute Truth, ultimately, then <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is required. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to know the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Being, then you have to go through <span class="Italic">bhakti. Jñāna,</span> so-called <span class="Italic">jñāna, bhakti</span> includes. Just like <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> includes everything, but <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> does not include <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> It is imperfect. In <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> there is little touch of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> but in <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> there is full <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> Because unless you... Absolute Truth is realized in three stages, <span class="Italic">brahmeti, paramātmeti, bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> So those who are on the stage of Brahman and Paramātmā, they're not in the Absolute Truth. Part of it. But when one understands Bhagavān, then he understands Paramātmā and Brahman. That is full knowledge. There are three things-<span class="Italic">sat, cit, ānanda.</span> So Brahman realization is <span class="Italic">sat.</span> Paramātmā realization is <span class="Italic">cit.</span> But <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is not there. But if he does not get <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> then falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says Christianity says the same thing. Not the Christianity of today, but original Christianity said the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta.</span> We are, as spirit soul, being part and parcel of the Supreme, <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is our goal, <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> blissfulness. But that blissfulness, you cannot get simply by understanding <span class="Italic">sat-cit.</span> You must come to the platform of <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa. So because these so-called <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they do not get <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> they do not have the entrance into the <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> platform, they come to this material <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> this material pleasure. Therefore they take to this hospitality or opening a school or philanthropic work, another type of this material pleasure. Therefore Śaṅkarācārya recommended:</div>
<div class="Verse">bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>bhaja govindaṁ mūḍha-mate<br class="calibre2"/>prāpte sannihite kāle na hi<br class="calibre2"/>na hi rakṣati dukṛn kāraṇe</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Your simply this grammatical jugglery of words will not help you. <span class="Italic">Bhaja govindam.</span> Therefore we, <span class="Italic">govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> We, our principle is to worship Govinda the <span class="Italic">ādi-puruṣa, tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.</span> So without coming to that stage, perfection is not complete. Partial, the <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda,</span> the <span class="Italic">brahma-anubhūti</span> is partial, <span class="Italic">sat.</span> "I am not matter. I am not destructible. I am eternal." This is <span class="Italic">sat.</span> And <span class="Italic">cit,</span> knowledge, full knowledge about spiritual... But <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> you have to come to the third stage, <span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br class="calibre2"/>tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam<br class="calibre2"/>brahmeti paramātmeti<br class="calibre2"/>bhagavān iti śabdyate<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.11]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So we have to come to the stage of understanding Bhagavān, otherwise knowledge is imperfect. <span class="Italic">Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">. Bhakti</span> is defined by Rūpa Gosvāmī, <span class="Italic">jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛta,</span> above <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> stage. <span class="Italic">Jñāna, karma, karma</span> stage, <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> stage, above them. Untouched by <span class="Italic">jñāna. Karma</span> is material and <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is marginal between material and spiritual. So you have to go above that, <span class="Italic">karma jñāna,</span> then it is <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Also that verse in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ</span> [SB 1.2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ</span> [SB 1.2.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Janayaty āśu vairāgyam.</span> I don't see Bhagavān dāsa. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He's organizing the ceremony for tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difference is, a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> pure <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> he has <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> But a <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> may not have <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Once Professor Chenique asked me whether we thought it was possible for a Christian like himself to also realize the perfection of Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Christianity in Vaiṣṇavism. Christianism is Vaiṣṇavism. Anyone who accepts the supremacy of God, he's a Vaiṣṇava. So Christian, Christianity, "God is great," they say. So that is Vaiṣṇavism, "God is great."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Chenique:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui,</span> but now the Christians say that God is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Now the Christians say God is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not Christianity. If you can change, there is no religion. That is mental concoction. As soon as you make change, we reject immediately, useless. Religion (is) the world of God. Religion means the word of God. You cannot change the word of God. If you change the word of God, that is material, that is not religion. You cannot change the word of God by your votes. That is useless. If you say that religion..., religion means the <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse, Sixth Canto. There is no Sixth Canto there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have one volume, but it's the wrong volume. We have Volume Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. The definition of religion is just like law. Law can be given by the government. You cannot make law. If you make at home some law, nobody will touch it. It is not obligatory. But if government says "Keep to the right," it is obligatory. This is law. So religion, you cannot manufacture religion. Religion means the word of God. And if yearly or quarterly you change the words, that is not religion. That is not religion. That is mental concoction. Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. No change. Others, they are interpreting in their own way. That is not <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is something else. (to devotee:) Keep it there. He will take. In the words of God there is no question of changing. You cannot change. As soon as you make a change, immediately it is material; it has nothing to do with spiritual world. The same example, the law of government is one, and if you make change, that is not law. Government says "Keep to the right," you have to keep to the right. You cannot make "Keep to the left," no. That is nowadays happening-which edition of Christianity? There are so many. Therefore it is, the purport of Christianity is lost. That is lost. You have, what that verse I wanted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They couldn't find the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, they couldn't. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the verse. Religion means the words given by God. But they have no idea what is God, whether He can speak or He's a dull, dumb. That is the difficulty. The Māyāvādīs<span class="Italic">,</span> they say God has no mouth. So how He will speak? He has no eyes, He has no ears. Then who will hear my prayer? That is Māyāvādī definition. But <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say <span class="Italic">apāni-pādo javana gṛhīta.(?)</span> That both things, that He has no leg, but he can walk faster than anyone. He has no ear, but He can hear everything. Just like we have got this ear, but I cannot hear what is going on next room. But God has no ear, but He can hear here, there, everywhere. This is Vedic definition. This is Vedic definition. <span class="Italic">Śṛṇoti akarṇa.</span> He has no ears, but He hears everything. That means that it is not the fact that He has no ear, but He has no limited ear like me. And therefore described <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot compare with this body. Because <span class="Italic">sat</span> means eternal. So this body is not eternal. So when God has no body means He hasn't got a body like this. He is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. But He has body. You cannot say impersonal. But His body is of different quality. Just like you have got body, but you cannot swim in the..., or you cannot remain within the water. Similarly, he has got body, but not the body like this, perishable. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda,</span> this body is perishable. But He has got imperishable. <span class="Italic">Avyayātmā.</span> We have to understand in that way. Not that because it is stated He has no body that means He is zero. No, he has got body, but not body not like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Professor Chenique's suggesting that in the Middle Ages there were many philosophers who also were researching the same questions of the body of God and how His body is different from ours, and they came to exactly the same conclusions as are mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> so he's suggesting some of our devotees should read some of these books so we'll be able to in our preaching show the French people these conceptions that God has a body are not foreign conceptions, and actually even European philosophers in the Middle Ages were saying the same things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can convince by your words. It is not necessary that you have to read so many other words. If you are yourself convinced, then you can convince others by your words. The fact. The same example, when there is fire actually you can express it by any word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He feels that it's because he has read all these books during his youth, now he's able to appreciate <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He feels that because he read all of these other books during his youth that now he's come to the point he can appreciate <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyone who is after truth, he'll appreciate truth. That's a fact. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi [SB </span>1.1.1<span class="Italic">].</span> That is the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> beginning. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.</span> If one is after truth, he'll appreciate truth wherever it is. Every point, from any angle of vision, those who are searching after truth, everything is explained. Primarily in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and elaborately in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So about the Christian religion, what is the conception of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> (translating) If I speak in English then I'll say that God is the father, the son and the Holy Ghost-not one person, but three persons. But if I want to say the same thing in Sanskrit, then I'll say <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three persons? God is three persons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Father, the son and the Holy Spirit. But he says that that means the same thing, as far as he's concerned, as <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why three persons? God is one. Expansion, you can say expansion. Just like <span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> The person is one. In the dictionary it is said, "God, the Supreme Being," is it not? Person is one. So person is one, now His expansion, His son, His spirit, what is that? Holy Spirit... That is another thing. But the person is one, the Supreme. What is the definition of God? Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He said that in Christianity it's more complicated than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Person is one, but they have no idea the Supreme Person can expand. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It says, "Superhuman being, worshiped as having power over nature and human fortunes; Deity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, this is the definition of God. "Superhuman being."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Superhuman being. Worshiped as having power over nature and over human fortunes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> Demigods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No other definition? God Supreme Being is not there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Supreme Being, creator and ruler of the universe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Supreme Being. Supreme Being means one. There cannot be many Supreme. But He can expand. This is defined in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">. Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam, ananta-rūpam,</span> many millions of expansions. <span class="Italic">Ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam,</span> but He's the original person. So the Supreme Being is one, but He has got multi-expansions. That is another thing. <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says Christianity is actually coherent, but one has to study it very deeply to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He says just like Vaiṣṇavism is also coherent, but one has to study very deeply. Otherwise, one cannot see it. He said if we examine all the religions and find out the axiomatic truths of every religion, we'll see how they are all coherent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The thing is that religion means to understand God. If one does not understand God, then his religion is still defective. Religion means to understand God. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje ahaituky apratihatā [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> When you understand God and your relationship with God, then it is perfection of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhūgarbha:</span> He said that he feels very thankful that you've given him such a long <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> He's very happy that you've given so much enlightenment in many subjects. He's just passing through with his daughter. He'd like to stay tomorrow to see the installation of the Deities, but he has to go to a Tibetan temple in the south of France. On Saturday he has to be there, so he has to drive, and he said that he's found the Tibetans are also very good devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
