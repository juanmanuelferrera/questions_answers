<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nārada Muni was cursed, accepted one curse. And Dakṣa-rāja said that "I curse you that you will stay anywhere." So he said, "Yes, that is very good for me." (laughs) He could curse, counter, but he accepted, "Yes, it is a very good curse. I shall not stay anywhere." "You have spoiled my children to become mendicant, go back to home, back to Godhead. They did not enjoy this material world. You are so heinous," like that. Our students' parents, they are also thinking, "What is this nonsense, no meat-eating, no illicit sex? The enjoyment of life, everything is spoiled. They are becoming <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" So they are cursing me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say you must have hypnotized us to give this up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Judah, what is that, charmistic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Charismic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Charismatic, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) He also said. Yes, they are thinking it is hypnotism. "All young men, their life is for this material enjoyment, and they are giving up everything and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? What is this?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In Māyāpur there is one astrologer and he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that astro...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I don't know his name. He lives in..., across, on the other side there, where the bank is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Bamanpukur.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Svarūp Gañj.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, Svarūp Gañj. So he likes our movement very much, and he said that, he told one of our devotees that you were the most powerful personality in the world. And he has given very accurate astrology readings to some of our devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he was, what he has told about me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That you are the most powerful personality in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I am representative of Kṛṣṇa, then I must be the most powerful. Kṛṣṇa has got..., all omnipotent. (laughs) Most powerful, the most my Godbrothers. That is my credit. They are thinking like that, "This man became most powerful than all of us. (Still laughing) He was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span>" They used to say all the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas, paca-gṛhastha. Paca</span> means decomposed. What Bon Mahārāja is doing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I don't know up to date. I just know a few weeks ago he was in Canada.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> When our devotees go to see a professor after Bon Mahārāja has spoken with him, the professors don't want to take our books. They make complaints that our books are too sectarian, they're not scholarly, they're not..., in this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is making that poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah, he is giving some propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The idea that he is more scholarly and more academic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals will not, "Where is your book?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He's just got that one book, and he doesn't have that anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has sold all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I think so. I never see it anywhere in any libraries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He wanted to send some to America. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...by his propaganda, they are talking like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, one thing, there was one debate, and he was there, and our men were there too. And he was representing Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Swami Bon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It was an interreligion meeting, and there were representatives from different Christian..., and he was there for Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But he didn't give any strong argument; he just presented it as if it were another way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, he said, he described it very... About Rādhā... That Lord Caitanya is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa combined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we say also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, but the boys who were there, they said it wasn't at all the way you speak. He wasn't saying that ours was the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, ours is the best, neither he is best nor it is as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> One of our men spoke up and said that, the president of Toronto temple, Uttamaśloka, he said, "So far we've just discussed different religions from a relative point of view. Why don't we discuss what is the Absolute Truth?" And they all became... They didn't like that. They said, "We feel defensive when you speak like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And Swami Bon said that "You don't know so much."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yeah, he criticized our Uttamaśloka. And then he said, "Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, they don't engage in argumentation and debate." So Uttamaśloka said, "Yes, Lord Caitanya argued with Prakāśānanda."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But Swami Bon said, "No, He didn't convert him by argument, He converted him by the effulgence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (To Bon:) "But there was argument, rascal." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And as a result of that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal, rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He told one professor that our devotees in general, they're not tolerant when someone speaks something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (To Bon:) "You are also not tolerant. Why you have come here? Because you are envious. You are the most intolerant. You are blaspheming."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. He also said that on the altar in Toronto... It's an altar just like in all our temples. He said, "Lord Caitanya should not be there with Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa." They have them separated like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? My Guru Mahārāja have so many Māyāpur temples, Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Bombay. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...men should be very strong to protest. They must know he has come purposely, purposefully. Of course, he will not be able to do anything. Simply ask him, "You, sir, what you have done for the last forty years? And who asked you to start this institute? And why you were called back by Guru Mahārāja?" You ask these things. "And you performed some ceremony for neutralizing your <span class="Italic">guru-aparādha.</span>" He did it. Some astrologer... He admitted that "I have offended my Guru Mahārāja. So I am not improving. So can you suggest anything?" He said that "You offer 108 <span class="Italic">bilva patra</span> to Lord Śiva." And he did it for so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prāyaścitta,</span> is that called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prāyaścitta,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You mention that in your <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion,</span> that if some offense is committed, it's not necessary to perform any rituals but to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and that one will become purified in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So nobody knows where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He was staying sometimes in New York City in a place called the Theological Seminary. He was being put up there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Theological Seminary?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He might have started. He might have started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And also he felt offended that the Brooklyn temple did not invite him. He said they knew he was there, but they didn't invite him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (To Bon:) Why? You could see there. It is a Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava temple. Temple... I invited him from...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He has some patrons among the professors. I know this one Professor O'Connell, he kept him at his home for some days and did some advertising for him for meetings. And then he has another professor friend in Montreal. So he knows different people. He has contacts. [break]</div>

He told me that, he said, "You know, sometimes you can't do everything that your guru tells you to do." He said, "It was a little difficult saying no to my guru, but I had to do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His parents sponsored him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He told me in Vṛndāvana that sometimes Bon Mahārāja is "a little too far out." His disciple said this.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the subject?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Just world religions with representatives from different religions. Each would speak on their understanding. They asked him what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness or Gauḍīya Vaisnavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who asked for the Absolute Truth, that...?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He asked Uttamaśloka, "Don't speak. You shouldn't..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What right he has got to say like that? It was a meeting. He did not say, "What right you have got to say me?" The president, he was president or what?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why he can, why he said like, "Don't speak"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They tried to do that to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Kurukṣetra. They did not want you to speak.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Somehow or other." This is science. "Somehow or other," "maybe," "perhaps." This is their science. [break] ...speculation. The whole Western countries, their all knowledge simply speculation. Nothing definite. [break] ...Professor Dimmock has "Definitive..." What is that translation, or something like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Definitive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Definitive, then translation of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> like that. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...you meet Bon Mahārāja, and if he talks again time, say, "You were sent in London for establishing a temple, why you could not do it? You remained there for three, four years. And why you were called back by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī? What did you do for the three, four years in spite of full support from Gauḍīya Maṭha?" We were sending seven hundred rupees. In those days seven hundred rupees means nowadays seven thousand. He was squandering the money. "Authority, authority, scholarly, how many books you have published from your institution for the last forty years?" He was in London. In the 1930's he came back. Came back means Guru Mahārāja called him back. Then he separated from Gauḍīya Maṭha, and he tried to start this institution. Sometimes in the 1945, '47..., not '40, '30. And it is '75, clear forty years. So what books you have published? Authority, scholarly, what books you have published? And how many scholars you have produced? Why it is closed now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He's bluffing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has simply collected money like anything by this bluff. Now people are asking that. Therefore Dalmia said one of the trustees, "You better give it to Bhaktivedanta Swami." They have seen. They have taken money from them. Or for maintaining the institution he regularly gets money from rich men in Calcutta, Bombay, one thousand, two thousand, 1,500, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He has given the school some title, "Oriental Institute." It is called the Oriental Institute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Institute of Oriental Philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Institute of Oriental Philosophy? Yes. And the students are coming to him with knives. That is his popularity. Amongst his own students, he is threatened with knife. And he has to sign something by such threatening. (end)</div>
