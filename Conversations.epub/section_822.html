<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All of them are South African?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, actually, he's from South Africa and he's from South Africa. These two devotees are going down for the first time, and Jagat-guru was preaching there once before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they will get visa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't require visa except for Jagat-guru. He's British, he's Canadian. He's South African boy. He's South African.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, they don't require visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only Jagat-guru dāsa, American.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So he'll get visa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So all five, you are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, we have studied this South Africa. They like our movement. They are purchasing books. That is very good sign. Is it not? They are purchasing? Who are purchasing books? Educated circle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Colleges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> College. That is.... College, universities, that is educated.... So I was surprised when, after my meeting, they purchased books, because these South African white men, they do not like very much Indians. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still, they like this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is very good sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even the Indians are attracted to our Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They lost their culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were thinking that this is 1976, and in July there is Ratha-yātrā. So by next year, '77, we hope to be able to have Ratha-yātrā in Durban. There may be a quarter of a million, half a million Indian people. One cart and three deities on one cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And whether government will allow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think so. They already have permission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> They can give permission, will do probably. And also we want to establish also, apart from the temple, one bus program which will reach all the towns and villages there in South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> And also we will go to Rhodesia and probably Malawi and maybe Mozambique, which are countries in our area. And also I spoke to the boys from Mauritius, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mauritius, we have got now devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have kept his address?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One is that gentleman, Mr. Narayan. He's an engineer with the city electrical department, and the other is a full-time devotee. I have his address, Mr. Narayan's address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are still here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's anxious to go back. He's going to London until August; then he's going back to Mauritius with his family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> We will invite him to come to our Durban festival. And also I've suggested that they also arrange something big, festival, because there are 600,000 Indians there, and that some of our men can go to the island and give them association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they'll give visa? Me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> For you? Oh, yes. I think we have to make a chest x-ray again and take several shots for you, (laughter) no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when you are going back? Tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When? Early in the morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. We're making the arrangement tomorrow to go. We're getting tickets and some books. Then Jagat-guru will follow a few days later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make vigorous propaganda all over the world. From South Africa, Australia, there is direct service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Direct service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Perth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Perth to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sydney.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, South Africa...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many hours? It's about nine hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not much. Nearer than India. From India to Australia takes so many hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Five hours it was, from Bombay to Mauritius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five hours, again nine hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And then it was about three hours to South Africa from Mauritius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, from Mauritius they can go directly to Australia. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Direct to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. If the flight is broken up like that, it's a little easier, from South Africa to Mauritius to Perth, or even to Bombay. It's about the same distance from Bombay to Mauritius as to Australia from Mauritius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda is thinking about going from India to South Africa to Australia to make the flight easier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think it makes the flight easier, because you're going like a triangle, this way and then this way. Let us arrange some nice program first, so that when you come again we'll have something nice to offer you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think in Mauritius there is good field. They adopted culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The problem in Mauritius has been that either they don't know how to collect, or they say it's a very poor country and they're not able to get funds to start any kind of a dynamic program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot chant even?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chanting they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted. We don't want money. So give them directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda.... (too faint)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> South African mission, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> At this present moment, Prabhupāda, we have a really unique situation, the best of all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> A unique situation in South Africa, because there are many Europeans that are being drafted into the Army, but they will not allow the Indians to be drafted. They don't want them to go into the military forces because they're afraid they're too intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some of our <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> they've been drafted into the army. We've lost several devotees like that, because it's very hard for them to maintain their Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the army.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Conscription.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, conscription. But the Indians are not drafted. There's no army for them. So we're hoping that in Durban, where you first preached at the City Hall, the young people there, if we can get them sufficiently enthused, that they'll also join, and then we'll be able to have a very big movement amongst Indian community as well. We won't lose any devotees like that from the draft.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think our students who are going to be ministers, they are excused from draft.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, even in South Africa the ministers.... No excuse. It's a very strict situation. If you don't go into the army, you go to jail. Even if you're a minister, they don't care. There is no religious grounds for objecting. But only the Europeans are in the army, no one else. They're afraid that if the Indians had guns, they might use them against the Europeans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So we're going to try and make more devotees this year, more Indian devotees especially. We've never really tried before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagat-guru:</span> Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you have seen on our altar, Gaura-Nitāi? We have large Gaura-Nitāi and two small, three actually, three small sets of Gaura-Nitāi Deities. The ones on the far left, just under Lord Nityānanda's feet, They are going also to South Africa. They came originally from East Africa. I mentioned it when I first came to Māyāpura(?). So we will be taking them. We have a very nice <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana</span> built for Them, finished tomorrow, and we'll be displaying Them at all our programs, preaching programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do the needful. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> (offer obeisances) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're very enthusiastic to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is life. One who is enthusiastic to preach, he is living. Others are dead. Just see how beautiful. Who is the rascal scientist can manufacture that by combination of chemicals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can imitate the fragrance. (laughs) They can imitate like monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you see only to the flowers, you become invigorated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If you see only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Invigorated, get a refreshment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you just see a flower. Yes, just to walk through a nice garden, it's very pacifying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many different colors and set up, craftsmanship. There is no brain behind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not chance. In this particular tree, this flower will grow. Color will not change. (pause) So somebody is preparing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who? (end)</div>
