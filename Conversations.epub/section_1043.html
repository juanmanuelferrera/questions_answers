<div class="Heading">Letter to Sai Baba<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>September 13, 1976, Vṛndāvana</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> This says, "God is an Indian." Putaparti. "God is an Indian. His contemporary <span class="Italic">avatāra...</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Putaparti? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Putaparti is in Andhra. "His contemporary <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> rests in the trinity of Sirti Baba, Sai Baba, and Prem Baba to come. So Satya Sai Baba, the second of the triple incarnation, asserted in the course of a marathon interview to add, 'In my present <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> I have come armed with the fullness of the power of the formless God to save humanity.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, to whom we shall address this letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Well, it depends where we want to send it for publishing. To this or to another magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says that "I'm <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span>" So therefore it should be addressed to him. He says. So address to Satya Sai Baba. Where is he, at Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, he stays at this Putaparti or in Bangalore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Putaparti...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That is a small village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Post office, Putaparti. And it is in, where Bangalore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That is in Andhra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Andhra. Hmm. Dear Sai Baba, just recently in the <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> paper, published on-give the date-we were surprised to find one article "God is an Indian." And you have claimed to become an incarnation of God to save the human society. What is the ground of your claiming as incarnation? And what you have done to save the human society? Will you explain for enlightenment of us. Or many of us. We have got the list of incarnations recorded in the Vedic scriptures and their respective activities also. So where is that record in the Vedic scripture about your appearing as incarnation? Lord Kṛṣṇa's incarnation is fully described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa's incarnationship or give... What it should be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa's incarnation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There may be so many, but I mean to say Lord Kṛṣṇa is incarnation, so <span class="Italic">avatāratva.</span> So what is the English? <span class="Italic">Avatāratva?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> The incarnationness or quality of being an incarnation, but that is not... The quality of being an incarnation is not... The most literal is incarnationness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore say that. Lord Kṛṣṇa's incarnationness is fully described in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Similarly, Lord Rāmacandra's incarnationness or Lord Buddha's incarnationness, Lord Caitanya's incarnationness, we have got full information in the Vedic literatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Lord Rāma's incarnationness, Lord Buddha's incarnationness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is your incarnation is described? Will you kindly give the reference. Anyone can say like you, that one is incarnation, as it has become a fashion nowadays. But is that claim only is the proof of one's becoming incarnation? Some such unauthorized claim of becoming an incarnation is certainly ridiculous. Such...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> ...unauthorized claim of one's becoming an incarnation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is certainly ridiculous. Then you have claimed to take form. What is he has written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Then you have claimed to take..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What he has written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "In my present <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> I have come armed with the fullness of the power of the formless God to save humanity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have claimed to... What is that? Again read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "I have come armed with the fullness of the power of the formless God to save humanity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have claimed to take a form of the formless God. But we see in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that God is never formless. Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ manyante mām abuddhayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>manyante mām abuddhayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto<br class="calibre2"/>mamāvyayam anuttamam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 7.24]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Unintelligent men who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is changeless and supreme."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord Kṛṣṇa in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yāmunācārya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from Rāmānujācārya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, 'My dear Lord, devotees like Vyāsadeva and Nārada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.' In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> and speculation on Vedic literature..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can give up to that Yāmunācārya's quotation. What you have written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> So far? Everything? Or just... Only, is one's word only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you have written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Dear Sai Baba, just recently..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Last what you have written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Similarly, Lord Rāma's incarnation, Lord Buddha's incarnation, Lord Caitanya's incarnationness, we have got full information from the Vedic scriptures. Where is your incarnation described? Will you kindly give the reference. Anyone can say like you, that one is an incarnation, as it has become a fashion nowadays. But is that claim only the proof of one's becoming an incarnation? Such unauthorized claim of one's becoming an incarnation is certainly ridiculous. Then you have claimed to take a form of the formless God. But we see in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that God is never formless."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (dictating:) Only the rascals and less intelligent class of men think that God is formless and when He incarnates, He takes a particular form. In this connection, a verse from Yāmunācārya may be quoted as follows. You have quoted the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> That quote?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Well, it doesn't mention the Sanskrit here of that Yāmunācārya verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. "In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said"-what you have written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh. We can put the Sanskrit, <span class="Italic">avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what you have written here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Such unauthorized claim of one's becoming... Then you have claimed to take a form of the formless God, but we see in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to quote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes. So, Bhagavad-gītā 7.24, Sanskrit and translation. "But we see in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>manyante mām abuddhayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto<br class="calibre2"/>mamāvyayam anuttamam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.24]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> "Unintelligent men who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is changeless and supreme." That God is never formless. Only the rascals and less intelligent class of men think that God is formless and when He incarnates he takes a particular form. In this connection a verse from Yāmunācārya may be quoted as follows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is Yāmunacārya's quotation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "My dear Lord, devotees like Vyāsadeva and Nārada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to quote that verse and the meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> But the Sanskrit wasn't give here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Sanskrit is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, but this verse from Yāmunācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You'll find the Sanskrit in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh. Which place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā. Tam,</span> it begins with <span class="Italic">tam.</span> You can find out. Call, call him. (bell rings) Read. The Sanskrit verse is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, it's not quoted here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tam paribhāvita,</span> like that. There is a verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh. I will find it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Which volume?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> First volume?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think. There is, what is called, index?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, for <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā?</span> Where's the verse index.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Which verse is it. If you give me the verse I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It begins <span class="Italic">tam paribhāvita. T-a-m. T-a-m. Tam paribhāvita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can bring here. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> So this quote goes on. "But those who in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing the <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in this connection, the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> is especially important. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> Brahman is impersonal, Paramātmā is localized, and Bhagavān is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Brahman is the impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahman is impersonal. Not "the." Paramātmā is localized, and Bhagavān is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Arjuna understood Kṛṣṇa after hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he addressed Kṛṣṇa as follows. Quote this, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out. No. Find out in the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma<br class="calibre2"/>pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam<br class="calibre2"/>ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.12]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣaṁ śāśvatam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Divyam.</span> So here Arjuna addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as <span class="Italic">śāśvataṁ puruṣam,</span> eternally the Personality of Godhead. It is never admitted that Supreme Lord is originally imperson. <span class="Italic">Puruṣam.</span> I have described <span class="Italic">puruṣam?</span> Yes. What you have written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "When Arjuna understood Kṛṣṇa after hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he addressed Kṛṣṇa as follows, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">,</span> etc. Here Kṛṣṇa addresses... Here Arjuna addresses Kṛṣṇa as <span class="Italic">śāśvataṁ puruṣam</span> or the eternal Personality of Godhead. It is never admitted that the Supreme Lord is originally impersonal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, you read the other verses. <span class="Italic">Param...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma<br class="calibre2"/>pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam<br class="calibre2"/>ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.12]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve devarṣir nāradas tathā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to quote this. Then? Read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That you have to give a quotation and, then? What is next verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> after this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āhus tvām,</span> then next, what is next verse.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"Tell me in detail, O Janārdana, of Your mighty potencies and glories, for I never tire of hearing..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is that "Your personality cannot be understood without Your mercy." There is a verse. <span class="Italic">Āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve.</span> Find out that verse.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is, but we are missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I have the Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The all <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> say that Your personality, although there are so many evidences in <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and authorized persons, still, the rascals cannot understand.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> So do you want to quote this verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Must quote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye<br class="calibre2"/>yan māṁ vadasi keśava<br class="calibre2"/>na hi te bhagavan vyaktiṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vidur devā na dānavāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.14]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (dictating:) So one has to accept the statement of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, how He is originally the <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> or person. Impersonal Brahman is expansion of the rays of His personal body, exactly like the sunshine is expansion of the rays of the sun-god Vivasvān. Vivasvān is a person in the sunglobe and Kṛṣṇa is also a person who spoke the philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> long, long years before He spoke the same to Arjuna. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore the conclusion is that originally God is always a person. Impersonal Brahman is emanation from the personal God. In other words, God, personal God is not from impersonal Brahman, but impersonal Brahman is from the personal God. That is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as follows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Impersonal Brahman is an emanation of the personal God. It is not, it is not that the personal God is an emanation of...from... or it is that impersonal Brahman is an emanation. It is not that the personal God is an emanation of impersonal Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impersonal Brahman is resting on the personal God, exactly that illumination of light is resting on the bulb. Not that the bulb is resting on the illuminated light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Exactly like illumination of light is resting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the bulb, electric bulb. Not the bulb is resting on the illumination. Besides that, we learn from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Second Chapter... Find out that verse. "It is not that we were..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Na tv evāham?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na tv evāhaṁ jātu nāsaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>na tvaṁ neme janādhipāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>na caiva na bhaviṣyāmaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarve vayam ataḥ param</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings, nor in the future shall any of us cease to be."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa has personally said to Arjuna that in the past he was person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> So "Kṛṣṇa, in person"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Yes. Kṛṣṇa, as a person, says to Arjuna that both of them existed in the past as person, and they'll continue to remain person in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Both of them existed in the past as person and both of them shall continue to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Remain as person in the future. So without knowing all this knowledge, a <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> accepts the incarnation of God as coming from imperson. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Under this heading you have proved yourself to become a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> And how a <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> or an ass can become the incarnation of God? Then? Read that <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> paper, one after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Then, this is the end of his quote and then the editor, the writer is speaking. "This may appear an extraordinarily controversial claim to those unfamiliar with the spiritual depths of Hindu religio-philosophy. The latter totally accepts the <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> concept which broadly means the descent of the divine principle into human affairs. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa intervenes to say..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the editor's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, this is the editor's. "In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa intervenes to save humanity from evil forces. The <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> personify earth, the mother, as groaning under a similar burden to supplicate God for relief." Then heading, "Solution and cure to world's ills. To Baba's devotees, the <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> has similarly come to provide both the solution and the cure to a world living in terror of a nuclear holocaust. The false dichotomies created by Western thought between God and man, <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> and <span class="Italic">deva,</span> simply do not exist in the Indian scriptures, which prescribe..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The dichotomies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dichot...? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Dichotomy means some kind of distinction, to make a distinction. He said the dichotomies created by Western thought between God and man, <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> and <span class="Italic">deva.</span> Differences or analysis of differences. "Simply do not exist in the Indian scriptures..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Which prescribe the assimilation of God in man and man in God as the basis of religion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is another rascaldom. God is always distinct from man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Sai Baba also quotes later, He is also directly saying, also later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Now here's the quote. "Baba personifies this philosophy. As he told me, 'God is man and man is God. All of us have something of God, the divine spark, within us. All men are divine, like myself, with the spirit embodied in human flesh and bone. The only difference is that they are unaware of this Godhood.' " I'll get it for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Here he says, "The mission of the present <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> is to make everybody realize that since the same God or divinity resides in everyone, people should respect, love, and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If he resides in everyone, then why he has special claim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, well he says he has remembered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He remembers? How God can forget?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That he says. That he says here. He says that, "Take paddy or rice by way of an illustration. Every grain of rice is enclosed in a husk. You have to remove the husk to get the grain of rice. Now husk and rice both come from the same seed. Rice is the equivalent of God in man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But still husk is not rice. You cannot say husk is rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He says the husk... He says "Rice is the equivalent of God in man while the husk can be compared to desire which reduces God to man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Therefore my desire is life plus desire equals man. Life minus desire equals God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (dictating:) You are desiring to become God. There cannot be no desire. But you're unceremoniously desiring to become God. Although there is no proof in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is accepted that the living entities are sparks of..., part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is accepted that the living entities..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Are part and parcel of God. But part is never equal to the whole. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "So you can claim as a spark of God, as every living entity can claim but you cannot claim as the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Supreme Person with full power. That is misleading. You can show a little magic, as other magicians also can show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "You can show a little magic as other magicians can also show."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot show the full magic, as Kṛṣṇa displayed or Lord Rāmacandra displayed. Therefore your claim as a full power is completely false and blasphemous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Therefore your claim for full power is completely false..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And blasphemous. In this way find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Completely <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Now someone may bring up the one point, they say "Well, if an <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> comes if he must show all kinds of great opulences and powers, then he says sometimes the incarnation shows this, but sometimes, like when Lord Caitanya appeared He didn't show <span class="Italic">viśvarūpa</span> or..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But He never claimed that "I am <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span>" But we understand from the <span class="Italic">śāstric</span> evidence. He never claimed. Rather when He was addressed as Kṛṣṇa He blocked His ears, "You don't say like that." He never claimed. He fully displayed Himself as a devotee. Not Bhagavān. Therefore <span class="Italic">Gaurāṅgavāda</span> is illegal. <span class="Italic">Gaurāṅga-nāgarī.</span> That is illegal. <span class="Italic">Moha-vāda</span> or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Gaurāṅga-nāgarī,</span> mentioning Lord Caitanya in the role of Kṛṣṇa dancing with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way, find out the faulty statement and give him proof. He can claim... Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
