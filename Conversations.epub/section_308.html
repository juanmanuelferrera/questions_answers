<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Go-kharaḥ. Go</span> means cow, and <span class="Italic">kharaḥ</span> means ass. Those who are living life, the bodily concept of life, they're simply <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ,</span> just like cows and asses. So, at the present moment, it is a civilization of <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ.</span> They may be proud, advanced, civilized man, but the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says that "You are all asses and cows." And we speak on the basis of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Don't be angry upon... We see all the cows and asses. [break]</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"You are talking like a very nice, learned scholar, but no learned man talks like this." That means "You are a fool." (laughter) He's friend, so He's talking very mildly that "You are, you are trying to talk like a learned scholar, but actually no learned scholar speaks like this." That means, "You are a fool."</div>

<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> Nobody knows. <span class="Italic">Dehāntara-prāptiḥ,</span> from one body to another, we are doing that, every moment, but these rascals, they do not know. I was a child, I was a boy. Where is that body? It is gone. It is a fact. I am in a different body. <span class="Italic">Dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> Still, they won't believe that there is life after death. <span class="Italic">Dehāntara-prāptiḥ</span> we are experiencing in this life. But they won't believe that after this <span class="Italic">deha,</span> there is another <span class="Italic">deha.</span> That they won't believe, such dull-headed. (Hindi) Are they dull-headed or (are) they intelligent scholar and scientist? What is your opinion? What is your opinion? You are practical man. [break] That is later on, <span class="Italic">so 'ham.</span> First of all, understand what you are <span class="Italic">aham,</span> then <span class="Italic">so 'ham.</span> You do not know what is <span class="Italic">aham.</span> So these rascals, they do not know <span class="Italic">aham,</span> and they're speaking, <span class="Italic">so 'ham.</span> [break] When you understand yourself, then you understand God also. Then you'll understand that God and yourself are of the same ingredient, so 'ham. Just like if I say, <span class="Italic">so 'ham.</span> "I am just like Indira Gandhi." Indira Gandhi is the big personality. So, "I am as good as Indira Gandhi." So this is applicable in this sense, that Indira Gandhi is Indian. I am also Indian. Indira Gandhi is a human being. I am also a human being. In this way, go on, analytical study. You'll find so many things, you are as good as Indira Gandhi. But still, you are not Indira Gandhi. So <span class="Italic">so 'ham</span> means to understand that I am not this matter. I am the spirit soul, as good as the Supreme Lord. But that does not mean I am Supreme Lord, or as good as Supreme Lord. Qualitatively, I am one, not quantitatively. Just like a drop of water from the sea. (aside:) You can come here. [break] All the chemicals in the drop of the sea water, you'll find in the sea also. But still, the drop of water is not equal to the sea. So <span class="Italic">so 'ham</span> means qualitatively one with God, the Supreme. That not means that "I am the Supreme Lord." That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sa brahma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sa brahma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Brahman, the spirit soul is Brahman. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sa brahma. </span>Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma. Paraṁ dhāma pavitram, paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">. Pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.</span> The <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma.</span> Kṛṣṇa is called <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma,</span> and we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we are Brahman. The drop of water and the vast water. So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, Supreme Person, and we are also persons, but not Supreme Person. Do you think you are Supreme Persons? Anybody? So anyone thinks that "I am Supreme Person," he is a crazy fellow, madman. He can say: "I am person. Kṛṣṇa is a person. I am also person." That is all right. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Vedic version. [break] <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There are internal senses also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There are counterparts of senses also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like your coat and shirt. The coat has got hand. But that is not hand. Real hand is within the coat. So actually the coat has no hands. So where is the question of coat having senses? Similarly, this material body is a lump of matter. Just like the dolls. The dolls are prepared with grass, hands and legs, and then it is plastered, and it becomes a nice doll. Similarly, we have got hands and legs, and this material is plaster. Therefore when the real hands and legs go away, they are no more hands and legs. They are simply lump of matter. Therefore, anyone thinks that this body, "I am," he's a fool. If you think that you are the coat, you are the shirt, then you are a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Keśava, Kṛṣṇa, everything, one, every senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is all spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> His senses are...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. He has no difference between the body and the soul. He's Supreme Soul, simply Supreme Soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He has no these external senses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. He has no external, internal. We are conditioned souls. We have got external, internal. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because people cannot understand it, they think that "Kṛṣṇa is like us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He's not person then realistically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's person. Not like you person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> A different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you are always in want. Not like that. He's Supreme, full of all opulences. He's person, but not a person like us. The same example: Indira Gandhi is a person. I am also person. But not a person like me. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. Vigraha</span> means person. He is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda.</span> We are not <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> This body is not <span class="Italic">sat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not <span class="Italic">cit</span> also, not full <span class="Italic">cit.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither <span class="Italic">cit,</span> nor <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> So how you can be equal with Kṛṣṇa? You have got a different birth, you can have a... You have already, but it is plastered with matter. If you become without plaster, then you become as good as Kṛṣṇa, not in quantity, but in quality. Quality, you are already. But you have been covered with these dirty things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when these dirty things are washed, then you become as Kṛṣṇa as you in spirit sense. So at the present moment, we are with... Covered means with <span class="Italic">upādhi. Upādhi.</span> Just like your naked body and this body with shirt and coat. When you take away the shirt and coat, you become original body. Similarly, when you stop accepting this plastering process of body, material body, in different shapes, then you become <span class="Italic">mukta.</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">When you begin serving Kṛṣṇa in your original spiritual body, that is called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> [break] ...educated person. If you like you can learn all the things. You read our books. You have got our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> A few books I have got. Kṛṣṇa, I have got it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are member?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... [break] ...We have not very many followers because we disagree with all rascals. We are not rascal. [break] <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na sāntāya</span> (?). <span class="Italic">Mūrkha upadeśa...</span> (Hindi) If you give some lessons to the rascal, he becomes angry. <span class="Italic">Payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam.</span> If you ask a serpent, "Sir, you don't bite anyone, you take your here, milk, (indistinct)," the result will be he'll increase his venomous poison, and one day-"Phansss." (Sound imitating biting) You know the story? The <span class="Italic">kuta...,</span> (?) the wood-cutter and the snake. He found a snake... Snake, if it is not killed, then if you simply beat and becomes dead, again he revives life. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By air. So somebody killed, but he did not cut or burn. So he again, into life. So a wood-cutter, what is called? Who cuts trees and wood? He felt sympathetic. He took away the snake and kept at home and gave him some milk. So one day, when he was strong. (makes hissing sound) So he thought, "Oh, I gave you life, I gave you milk, and now you are trying to attack me?" He cut into pieces. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 7.9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> When Prahlāda Mahārāja's father was killed by Hiraṇya, I mean to say, Nṛsiṁhadeva, Prahlāda Mahārāja prayed, "Sir, You reduce Your anger now. Nobody is displeased with You because my father was just like a scorpion and snake, and when a scorpion and snake is killed, nobody's unhappy. So nobody is unhappy. Your action is not decried by anyone. Please now become in Your sense." So in the whole living entities, kingdom of living entities, the <span class="Italic">vṛścika, vṛścika</span> and <span class="Italic">sarpa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Scorpion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very dangerous. So if <span class="Italic">vṛścika</span> and <span class="Italic">sarpa</span> is killed, nobody's unhappy. [break] ...in Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, <span class="Italic">sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ, sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ.</span> A jealous, envious man, he's also crooked, and the snake, it is also crooked. But the man practiced to jealousy is more dangerous than the snake. Why? "He's human being. He's still more dangerous?" "Yes." "Why?" <span class="Italic">Mantrauṣadhi-vaśaḥ sarpaḥ.</span> You can bring under control the snake by <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and drugs. <span class="Italic">Khalaḥ kena nivāryate.</span> And the jealous man cannot be subdued. Therefore he's more dangerous than the snake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Than the snake. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...here is a very nice, educated man. He's very nice. But we say, "No. Because he has no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's as dangerous as if he is ordinary man." We don't give any credit. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Which is more important, to go back to Godhead or spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, one who is preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's already back to Godhead. [break] <span class="Italic">...īhā yasya harer dāsye karmaṇā manasā girā.</span> Preacher means he has engaged his body, his mind, his speeches only to glorify the Lord. That is preacher. So anybody who's engaged that business, he's <span class="Italic">jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate.</span> He's liberated even in this life. [break] ...even if he's liberated. So why he should seek for liberation? He's already liberated. He's already back to Godhead. He's already with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is talking with him. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi...</span> One who is actually preacher, engaged in Kṛṣṇa's glorification, service, he's already in Vaikuṇṭha. That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Etad īśanam...</span> It's just like Kṛṣṇa. If He comes within this material world, does it mean that he's in the material world? Similarly, Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee, he's not in the material world. In the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He gets the body? Does he get the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it's said, <span class="Italic">jīvan-mukta.</span> Although he is within this body, still he is <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> Just like... Example is you take a rod, put into the fire, by association of fire, it becomes red hot. At that time, it is fire, not rod. Similarly, if one is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has no other business than to glorify Kṛṣṇa, he's already in the Vaikuṇṭha. Why should he...? Therefore <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakta</span> doesn't require any <span class="Italic">mukti. Muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān. Mukti's</span> serving him. [break] ...Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">mama janmani janmani.</span> Birth after birth. But when you go back to home, back to Godhead, there is no birth. <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6].</span> You don't return. But here Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, "Birth after birth." So he's already <span class="Italic">mukta,</span> he's already in the Vaikuṇṭha. Is that clear? Yes. Therefore <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakta</span> is <span class="Italic">niṣkāma.</span> He has no any desire. Because he's already fulfilled with all desires. He's, he's in the service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, like sometimes the devotees are preaching, but they get feelings of getting entangled, so they want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is not yet perfect preacher. He requires perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So they argue with me or some other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of arguing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, they say, "Well, I want to fix myself up," and we want them to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching is our only business, preaching. Whatever we do, it is aimed at preaching. <span class="Italic">Namaskāra.</span> [break] That is our business. Whatever we are doing, it is for preaching. [break] In, in the practice, or in the engagement of preaching, their position is better than those who are worshiping the Lord in a secluded place, <span class="Italic">bhajanānandī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> What about those who are preaching, but imperfectly, and those who are...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even it is imperfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It's better than just sitting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] If he's sincere, it cannot be imperfect. Because... We are always imperfect, but Kṛṣṇa will help us. <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> How he can be imperfect? Kṛṣṇa will give him intelligence. Imperfect means whose intelligence is not perfect. But when Kṛṣṇa is giving intelligence, how he can be imperfect? He may be imperfect, but he's being helped by Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he's not imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idam [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's associating with Kṛṣṇa. And unless one is confidential devotee of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa does not speak with him. But when he becomes perfect, confidential servitor, Kṛṣṇa speaks with him, "Do like this, do like that," and he'll do that. And therefore in his action, you won't find any fault. [break] If somebody perfect instructs him, "Do like this," then my action is not imperfect. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> If I say, "Yes, you give up everything. Just surrender to Kṛṣṇa," then I am perfect. And if I say, "<span class="Italic">So 'ham.</span> I am Kṛṣṇa," then you are imperfect. Is that...? [break] "...the same. I am the Lord. I am the Supreme." They're all imperfect. <span class="Italic">Vimukta-māninaḥ.</span> They have been described as rascals. They are strongly thinking that they are liberated. They're rascals. <span class="Italic">Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ</span> [SB 10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are talking like nonsense because their intelligence is not..., it is purified. He's therefore wrongly thinking that "I am the Supreme Lord. I am moving the sun." These rascals, they meditate, "I am moving the sun, I am moving the moon. I am this, I am that." This is their meditation. <span class="Italic">So 'ham.</span> So they are rascals. And how you can become the Supreme? As soon as you have got a toothache, you have to go to the doctor. And he was thinking he was supreme, nonsense. Rascal. [break] <span class="Italic">...bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa.</span> These are Māyāvādīs, those who are after, "I am the Supreme." They are Māyāvādīs. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, "Anyone who hears the philosophy of Māyāvāda, he is doomed. He is gone." [break] ...teaching, "Why you are seeking after God?" Just like Vivekananda taught, "Oh, why you are seeking after God? Don't you see so many gods are on the street? They are hungry. They are lame. They are <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> Why don't you worship them?" This is Māyāvādī. So if we take Vivekananda's version, and be engaged in the service of the <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> then I am misled. [break] ...preaching this <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā</span> for hundreds of years, at least one hundred years, but still, there are <span class="Italic">daridras.</span> Even in the city like Bombay, still. Fifty years ago, I came. I saw there are the residents of the footpath, having a small... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The pipe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still I find. When the rice is selling at eight rupees kilo, and when the rice was selling three rupees a mound, at that time also they were on the footpath, resident, and now also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Now also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now also. So how you can stop this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is God's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is nature's arrangement. And those who are rich... There are richer section when the rice was selling at three rupees per mound, and the richer section is still there when rice is selling, nine rupees a kilo. So they have no eyes because less intelligent. They cannot make equal. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">. Prakṛti,</span> in the <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> there are three modes of material nature. They will be manifested. It is not possible to make everyone of the same standard, the standard must be different. So they are simply spoiling their time to make the whole society on the same status. The communists are trying, the others are trying. That is not possible. So one should not be disturbed with all these superficial low and high places. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha<br class="calibre2"/>sama-duḥkha-sukhaṁ dhīraṁ<br class="calibre2"/>so 'mṛtatvāya kalpate</div>

Still, they are leaders. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">,</span> leaders are blind, and they're leading blind men.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> We have a company for interior decorating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India decorating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Interior decorating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Interior, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And... [break] ...and become one now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are always. But you forgot. That is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, I believe I was respecting all religions, all gods, but now I think I lay more emphasis on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can be all Gods then? That is practical. If everyone is God, then what is the meaning of God? If... Do you think everyone is president, everyone is Indira Gandhi? Indira Gandhi is one. The Prime Minister cannot be many. It is a common sense. How everyone can be God? This is nonsense. Anyone thinks that there are many gods, he does not know what is God. <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> God is one. <span class="Italic">Ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.</span> Therefore there is no education what is God. Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagava... Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "Nobody else superior than Me." That is God. <span class="Italic">Asama-ūrdhva.</span> God is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as <span class="Italic">asama-ūrdhva.</span> You can come this side? Let them come forward. You sit down... [break] ...equal to God. And nobody can be greater than God. That is "God is great." If somebody becomes equal to you, how you can be great? Or if somebody is higher than you, then how you can be great? So there is no equal to God, nor greater than Him. That is God. And that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] "...anyone greater than Me." That is God. There are so many Gods, false gods, nowadays. Can anyone say that "Nobody is greater than me"? All these rascal Gods, can he say? Can anyone say? Immediately... He feels some sickness. Immediately he has to call greater God, physician. And he's claiming, "I am God." We don't want such kind of God, manufactured God. We want real God. When we see nobody is greater than Him, that is God. [break] ...We accept so many pseudo, pretender as God. But we do not know how to test him, whether he is greater than everyone? Whether nobody is greater than him? Then he's God. Can you find out any, so many gods, who has no greater than him, or equal to him? You are claiming You are God, I am also claiming, God. Then we are equal. Then how you can be God or how I can be God? We are equals. As soon as you find there are equals, or as soon as find there is greater, then you are not God. God-the great. He must be greater than everyone. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> has concluded, <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> God; <span class="Italic">parama,</span> the Supreme; Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> And why? <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> His body is <span class="Italic">sat, cit, sac-cid-ānanda.</span> Now you test. Your body's not <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda. Sat</span> means eternal, <span class="Italic">cit</span> means full of knowledge, <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> means full of bliss. Is, is my body <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda,</span> this body? No. It is not eternal. It is full of ignorance. It is full of miseries. Then how it can be God? So God, there cannot be many Gods. Many gods, that is not many, that is one. Just like you have got millions of photographs. That does not mean you are million. You are one. But you have expanded millions. Just like the sun is found in every pot. In millions of pot, you keep. And the sun is reflected. Does it mean the sun has become million? No. The sun is one. Similarly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Reflections.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reflections. These are examples. Similarly, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> God is everyone's heart. That does not mean God is many. He's one. But He has got such inconceivable power that that oneness can be distributed into millions. <span class="Italic">Advaya. Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although God expands Himself in many forms, still, He's <span class="Italic">advaita,</span> one. <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam nava-yauvanaṁ ca [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's the original person; still, always fresh, young. <span class="Italic">Nava-yauvanaṁ ca.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa, you'll find always fresh. That picture of Kṛṣṇa, you see. <span class="Italic">Nava-yauvanaṁ ca.</span> Just a fresh, young man. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you see. Kṛṣṇa is driving. He's fresh, young man. But Arjuna has got moustaches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> People who are not aware of Kṛṣṇa, and are living...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> ...and it may take time for your people to educate them, till then they are not aware they are accepting somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are cats and dogs. They are doing something also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Cats and dogs, they are doing some business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> What percentage of people today know about Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. That we do not know. But anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is, more or less, like cats and dogs. Maybe bigger dog, bigger cat. Just like amongst the dogs, there are different varieties also. So similarly he belongs to that dog, cat class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Now if he is not got, then what shall he do to become aware?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone gets opportunity. But he'll not take the opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> In this country, yes, everybody has got opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not... Every country, every, all over the world. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. The opportunity's open for everyone, but he'll not do it. He'll say, "Why shall I surrender to Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Woman:</span> But, Guru Mahārāja, if one has some original faith in Jesus Christ or Muhammad, would he...? They think they're sons of God or a messenger of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Jesus Christ says "I am son of God." He never says, "I am God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Woman:</span> So if they follow Jesus Christ...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. Son of God is as good as God. That is another thing. We have no objection. Suppose in a big office, the father is there, the son is there. And the son has ordered something. The father will never say that "Don't do it." Because father and son, the same position. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But he is not Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He is not Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's son of Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Now, if we take another example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That some people worship gods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Some people who are strictly Śaivites.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, No. But then what is the connection then between Kṛṣṇa and Śiva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa and Śiva, just like <span class="Italic">dahi</span> and <span class="Italic">dudha. Dahi</span> is nothing but <span class="Italic">dudha,</span> but still it is not <span class="Italic">dudha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's a a different form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not different form, different action also. If you want milk, if I give you <span class="Italic">dahi,</span> and if I say, "Oh <span class="Italic">dahi</span> and <span class="Italic">dudha,</span> the same thing. Why you are not accepting this <span class="Italic">dahi?",</span> will you accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although the same thing, but action is different. If you become devotee of Lord Śiva, you'll get opportunity of material opulences. Because Lord Śiva is the husband of Durgā, and Durgā is the superintendent of this material world. So Durgā is under control. If one becomes a devotee of Lord Śiva, then Durgā gives him, eh? <span class="Italic">Dhanaṁ dehi rūpaṁ dehi rūpavatī-bhāryāṁ dehi yaśo dehi.</span> So you'll get all this, nice position, nice wife, nice power, famous... All this material, not spiritual. So to worship any other demigod than Kṛṣṇa is materialism. That is not spiritualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Worshiping Viṣṇu is also material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Viṣṇu is not. Viṣṇu is Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu the same, expansion. That you have to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Rāma also.</div>

<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa also says,<span class="Italic"> mām ekam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What is the position of people like Guru Nanak, Muhammad, and other people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're servants of Kṛṣṇa. They are serving on behalf of Kṛṣṇa among certain people who cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Just like a student in the primary class, he does not know what is M.A. examination. Therefore teacher is teaching according to his position. But he's a teacher, he's an authorized teacher, appointed by the school, authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So they're representatives?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But they're... Just like Lord Buddha. We accept him as incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. But he preached, "There is no Kṛṣṇa. There is no God. I don't care for the <span class="Italic">Vedas."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He's flaunting the authority of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is authority himself. <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> He's personally Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Does he say so, or you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Sometimes he has to say so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And he's allowed to say so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is he allowed to say so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He is the Supreme, He can say. Just like a father cheats sometimes the son. The son has taken from the pocket of the father one hundred rupees' note. He's not separate. The father takes one lozenges, two paise worth. "Oh, my dear son, you can take it, very nice. You give me that." "Ah yes." It is not cheating? He's giving two paise worth lozenges, and taking hundred rupees' note. Is it not cheating? This is cheating. But father is cheating; therefore it is good. You cannot imitate father and cheat others. Father can do anything for the welfare of the son. That is another thing. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa appears as a cheater, the atheist class of men and Lord Buddha say, "No, no, there is no God. Yes, it is all right. You are right. But you hear me." "Yes, sir, we shall hear you." But he's God. This is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Was he preaching <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that there is no God, but he's God. Just like the policeman sometimes cheats. He goes as a gambler, but he's a policeman. So that is another thing. Therefore if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then you understand all these different activities. <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> If you understand Kṛṣṇa, then you understand everything. And you become liberated. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ.</span> If anyone understands what is Kṛṣṇa, why He comes, what His activity is, then <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa, you, after giving up this body, you haven't got to come again in this material world. Simply by studying Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we are preaching, "Simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] ...life is meant for to possess complete knowledge of the Supreme. That is perfection of knowledge. That is possible in the human form of life, not in the life of cats and dogs. That is not possible. So we have got this opportunity. If we spoil this life, living like cats and dogs, then we are missing the opportunity. This is the opportunity to understand Kṛṣṇa, God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Merely knowing it won't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Merely knowing won't do also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you know, you'll act. But if you do not know, how you'll act? In the darkness? But even if you know simply... That Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">janma karma me divyam.</span> Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Janma karma...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fourth Chapter. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ. Tattvataḥ,</span> if you can understand, then your business is done. Then <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then, after giving up this body, you are not going to accept any more this material body. My problem is acceptance of this material body. That is my problem. Because these pains and pleasure, feeling of pains and pleasure, is due to my this body. Therefore Buddha philosophy is <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa,</span> "Make this body zero." That is his philosophy. <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa.</span> Because people are bothered due to these pains and pleasures. Here everything is painful. But we take something pain, as pleasure.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Devotee... Because people want perfection. But their perfection is to serve Kṛṣṇa. Their perfection is not to stop this body. But the... Anyone who knows Kṛṣṇa, he's not living in this material world. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who's engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, he's transcendental to these material qualities. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...and then, after leaving this body, you are not going to accept any material body. And as soon as you accept a material body, you are under pains and pleasure. No pleasure, simply pains. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> We are trying to avoid pains. But it is not possible. The real pain, birth, death, old age and disease, that remains. What is the use of temporary getting some so-called pleasure?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why to lament? "Oh, everyone is becoming good men. Nobody's coming in the prison." It is to be lamented? That nobody's coming in the prison house, it is very good news. But that will not take place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Should it affect the normal duties?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Should it affect the normal duties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real duty is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is normal duty. All, all other duties are abnormal duties, crazy duties. Just like <span class="Italic">pāgala,</span> they're all crazy.</div>

Just like dogs sometimes goes very fast this way, that way, that way, they're passing with motor car, this way, (makes barking sound) "Onh, onh, onh, onh, onh, onh." They're simply spoiling time. In America, I have seen, always, (makes automobile noise:) "sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh." Here also. But we see these rascals spoiling time.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, where we are getting money? Where we are getting money? Just like In London, George Harrison has given us a house, fifty-five lakhs worth. So if I wanted to possess this house by doing this business, three lifetimes would have been required. Not even three lifetimes. We are spending like anything. But we have no stock. We do not know what we shall eat tomorrow morning. We do not know. It is our position. We do not know what I shall eat tomorrow or this evening. But do you think we are starving? We have no problem.</div>

Kṛṣṇa is giving opportunity of eating for the cats and dogs, the birds and beasts, and I am engaged in His service, He'll not give me food? Because we are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, therefore we are thinking, "If I do not work like these cats and dogs, I'll starve." That is my imperfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness means he knows that "I have engaged my life in Kṛṣṇa's business. Kṛṣṇa is..., <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> He's feeding millions and millions of living entities. And he'll keep me starving?" Is it possible? That means he, he does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. He's thinking Kṛṣṇa is a fictitious thing. That is his position. He does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...then they would have been confident, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is feeding everyone. Why not me? What I have done? Because I am engaged in His service, therefore I shall starve?" And the devotee has no such question also, whether he'll starve or eat. It doesn't matter if he starves. It doesn't matter. He thinks, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa has put me in this position, to starve." Just like in hospital. A patient is ordered by the physician: "You should not eat anything." So he knows, "It is good for me." Similarly, a devotee, when he's starving, he knows, "Kṛṣṇa has put me in this starving condition. It is good for me." He never complains.</div>

I would have been put into more severe condition of life, but He is a little, giving me little pain. So I must be very much obliged to Kṛṣṇa that He's so kind upon me." So if one lives like that, <span class="Italic">mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk,</span> he has got the claim to become liberated. Just like a son has got the right to claim the property of father, similarly, one who lives like this, he has the claim to become liberated. <span class="Italic">Mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk.</span> That is... This is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata's</span> statement. And similarly, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> also it is stated... Sit down. Yes. Why you are late? We have talked so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha.</span> That I have already explained.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Just like one is in winter season, and the winter... Not in this country. In Western countries, it becomes below thirty degrees. In Canada and what other places?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Virginia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Oh yes. Thirty below zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have no experience below zero degrees. But in Europe, America, there is places. In Russia also, below fifty degrees. But they do not stop their business. They know that "Winter season has come. It will go away again." So devotees, even they are in distressed condition, they know, "It has come due to my bad activities in the past. It will go away. Let me suffer and finish it." Just like if you become, all of a sudden, infected with some disease. So what? You'll go mad? No. You know that "I have infected this disease. Let me suffer a few days. It will go away. That's all." This is the mentality of the devotees. They are not disturbed. And if he's not disturbed, then he's fit for becoming liberated.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">And our aim is <span class="Italic">amṛtatva,</span> how to become immortal. That is our aim of life. So we have to achieve that goal of life. We should not be disturbed with this temporary distress and pleasure. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tapasā brahmacaryeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>śamena ca damena ca<br class="calibre2"/>tyāgena satya-śaucābhyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yamena niyamena vā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These are the processes to become perfect. <span class="Italic">Tapasā.</span> First thing is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> And nobody's prepared to undergo <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> And human life is made for <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Therefore in Vedic civilization, you'll find <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,</span> they were all engaged in <span class="Italic">tapasya. Rājarṣi, devarṣi.</span> Bharata Mahārāja, under whose name this planet is called Bhāratavarṣa, at the age of twenty-four years, he gave up his young wife, children, and went for <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> is the life of the human being. Not to live like cats and dogs. That is not human life. Restrained. <span class="Italic">Tapasya.</span> But here there is no, at the present moment, there is no question of <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Even one is ninety years old, he's still engaged in these material activities. Even a person like Gandhi, unless he was killed, he would not give up politics. The material activities are so palatable for the materialists, that even up to the point of death... In Bengal, there was a big zamindar. So his father, er, his sons asked him at the time of death, "Father, what we can do for you, last desires?" So he expressed that "That man is my enemy. If you can bring him here and beat him with shoes, I'll be very much satisfied." This is material world. Even at the time of death, he's thinking enmity with others. And he will, he wanted to be happy that "If you bring that man and beat him with shoes, I'll be very happy." The other day somebody said that one man was cut into two, and he was asked, "What do you want?" He said, "Give me a cigarette." (laughter) This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And he was cut into two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was going to die, still he was asking, "Give me a cigarette." He does not know anything else. Therefore one has to practice. <span class="Italic">Ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ [SB </span>2.1.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> At the time of death, if you can remember Kṛṣṇa, then your life is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. Simply if you can... Just like Ajāmila. He simply chanted, "Nārāyaṇa." <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> He was saved from the greatest danger. So this human form of life should be so trained up that at the time of death you can remember Kṛṣṇa, "Kṛṣṇa, now you can judge what I have done for you, and what you have done for me." Then give me that place. That's it." That... If you have worked whole life for Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is not ungrateful. He'll give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Can a person become Kṛṣṇa conscious only by renouncing, or can he do both, continue his life and also become Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What we have renounced?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, you are not conducting any business. You are conducting the business of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So in Kṛṣṇa's business, there is no question of renouncement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, but that is not a specific thing. But if somebody's carrying out a particular duty, does he have to renounce that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That particular duty, you cannot manufacture. That particular duty is, as Kṛṣṇa says, if you cannot... <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ... [Bg. </span>4.13]. (end)</div>
