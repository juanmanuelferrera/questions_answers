<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So their residence place is not very far away, and she was curious. She came over a few days ago to find out more about Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) English lady:</span> I've seen a few about the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We live down there, you see, and we've seen them several times in the street singing, and asked them what you're doing, really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can keep it here. It may fall down. No. So do you know something about our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I've been told something about it, the other day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are preaching God consciousness. God is God. God is neither Christian, nor Hindu, nor Muslim. God is God. So everyone should be God conscious. That is our movement. We are preaching love of Godhead. So it doesn't matter what type of religion one is following. We simply want to see that he has love for God. Our <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> defines: that is first-class religion following which one becomes a lover of God. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is first-class religion if by following that one becomes a lover of God. It doesn't matter what religion he is following, but the test will be whether he has become a lover of God. That is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So you don't try to convert people from other religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One can be Christian and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway. We are teaching how to love God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. So we're doing the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But the test is there, whether he has become a lover of God or lover of dog. That is the test. If you find that he has become a lover of dog, then his religion is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How does he know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see whether he's loving God or dog. That's all. That you can see. Everyone can see, whether he has got good love for dog or good love for God. That you can see. Anyone can see. The test is there. Crucial test is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Jesus used the expression loving God or loving mammon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That says, or... Everyone says different way. Mammon or dog is expression in the faith. That is the test. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says:</div>
<div class="Verse">yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam<br class="calibre2"/>śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>govinda viraheṇa me</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Yugāyitaṁ,</span> "Every moment is just like twelve years." <span class="Italic">Cakṣuṣā pravṛṣāyitam,</span> "crying like torrents of rain." <span class="Italic">Cakṣuṣā pravṛṣāyitam, śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ.</span> "Oh, I find everything is vacant." <span class="Italic">Govinda viraheṇa me,</span> "without God, without..." This is an ideal picture. So another test is, <span class="Italic">bhaktiḥ pareśānubhava-viraktir anyatra syāt.</span> If one has become lover of God, naturally he will be detached to material enjoyment. Love of God and love of material world cannot go together. Either this or that. Just like Lord Jesus Christ. He never advised to, for economic development, for industrial development, or this and that. So many things. He sacrificed everything for God. That is one test, that "Here is a lover of God." He was punished that "You, you stop this preaching," but he did not. So that is love of God. He sacrificed everything. That is love of God. So the ideal is Lord Jesus Christ, and the follower must be, at least to some extent, to that point. That is test. So we say that you follow any religious path. That doesn't matter. We want to see whether you are lover of God. That is our propaganda. And if one is serious about loving God, it doesn't matter in which way he'll develop that dormant love. It doesn't matter. Just like one, a person wants to be a very nice student of mathematics. It doesn't matter from which university he takes the degree. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. He can go. Just like students are coming from one country to another, one country to another. Because his aim is education. So if one is serious about loving God, then it doesn't matter in which way he learns that art. It doesn't matter. He won't discriminate, "Oh, I must learn this art from this university." No. Any university. It doesn't matter. So our principle is that we are teaching love of God. So actually, those who are after God, they are coming. It doesn't matter whether he is in America, in Russia, in Africa, or Canada. It doesn't matter. They are coming. And method is simple. Chant the holy name of God. If you have got any name, you chant. We preach this. We don't say that you chant Kṛṣṇa. If you have got any name, God's name, then chant that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We say Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Jesus Christ never said that He is God. He said "Son of God." We have no objection to chant the name, holy name of Jesus Christ. We have no objection. But we are preaching that "Chant the holy name of God." If you haven't got any name of God, then you chant our conception of name of God, Kṛṣṇa. We don't say Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis<br class="calibre2"/>tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavān mamāpi<br class="calibre2"/>durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Lord Caitanya says, in each and every name of God... There are many names of God. But in each and every name of God, the full potency of God is there. So... And there is no hard and fast rule for chanting the holy name of God. Anywhere, at anytime, anyone, in any circumstances, he can chant. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says "My Lord, You are so merciful that in this age..." Why...? Not in this age. Every age. "You are always in full potency in Your name. And I can associate with You simply by chanting Your holy name. But I am so unfortunate, I have no attraction for that." A simple thing, to chant the name. God has become so kind, "You simply chant My name." But I am so unfortunate, I have no attraction for that. Now, these people are being taught... They have got this bead bag. I have also got. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. Now where is the loss? If I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, where is the loss? And where is the want of time? They are walking on the street, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. I am sitting here, and now I'm talking with you. As soon as I finish talking, I shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. So where is the difficulty? But ask people to chant the holy name of God, he won't accept. Unfortunate. And such simple thing. He hasn't got to go to church, to temple, or to go to hell or heaven. In whatever condition he is, he can chant holy name of God. But they're so unfortunate, they won't accept this theory. <span class="Italic">Etādṛśī tava kṛpā.</span> "So God is so merciful, but I am so unfortunate that I cannot chant His holy name." There is no charges, there is no fee, there is no loss. If there is some gain, why not try for it? And the gain is there. That you practically see. Because these boys from Europe, America, and other places, they were... I do not wish to discuss. (laughter) But just see the process now. Not the process one has... Other has to calculate. Then calculate, then serve. Yes. There is so much profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So what you want more? Therefore let us cooperate. Don't think that it is against Christianism or it is sectarian. Let us cooperate fully. Jointly, let us preach all over the world, "Chant the holy name of God." Let us join together. That should be the real purpose of devotees of God. Here is... They are preaching love of God. Why should we be envious about them? It doesn't matter. We don't say that you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you have got name of God, you chant it. That's all. But we are preaching this cult, that chant the holy name of God. That's all. So what objection there may be from other sects? But they are envious. Because the younger generation are taking to it, so they are envious. Why they are envious? We wanted to purchase one church, and the priest in charge said that "I shall better burn this church. I shall not give them." Just see. Why? What we have done wrong? This is the very statement. "Better I shall burn this church, but I won't give them." Then? What we have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Don't worry about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't worry. That is another thing. But there are so many vacant churches. They are for sale. But as soon as we go, they refuse. "No."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> When you chant, do you have to think what you're saying? How can you do other things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, many things require your concentration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, let us first of all chant the holy name. Then we shall think of concentration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You see, two, two things... You can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Concentrate, concentration automatically. If I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and I hear, that is concentration. That is concentration. Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But you can't read or talk to someone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of reading. We are simply asking to chant. Reading will come later on. Just like a small child, he's taught... In our educational system they chant... What is that? That...? (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Pahara pahara.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Pahara.</span> Alphabet. A.I.E.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They chant. By chanting, by hearing they learn. "A,B,C," like that. "2 plus 2 equal to 4." We did it in our childhood. One boy will chant like that. "2 plus 2 equal to 4." And we shall repeat. "2 plus 2 equal to 4." So repeating three times, I understand 2 plus 2 equal to 4.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Do you find that the chant goes on in your heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Do you find that the chant goes on in your heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It goes deeper and deeper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything we hear, it goes to the heart. If I call you by name, it does not go to my heart? "You rascal. You stupid." You hear. Does it not go to my heart? Why I become angry unless it goes to my heart. If "rascal," "stupid," and all these bad names go to my heart, why God's name will not go to my heart? If by calling you by ill names you become angry, that means it goes to your heart. Why not good name? It goes. It enters through the ear and goes to the heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I'm doing that, saying sometimes a little prayer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you repeatedly chant, it will remain. It will always remain in your heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Always going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no chance of escape. Chant constantly, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. It remains in the heart. Not only my heart. Others' heart, they also joke, "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" If it can remain in others' heart, why not my heart? Those who are joking me, imitating me. We... Last time, when I was going in Africa, I stopped for few minutes in Athens. Some of the younger residents chant, "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" You see? As soon as they saw us, they began to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. They could understand, "These are Hare Kṛṣṇa people." Yes. So by their dress, by their <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> they oblige others to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, either for imitating or for joking. So they gain. But if Hare Kṛṣṇa chanting has got any effect, even by joking like that, he'll get gain. If it is actually spiritual, by simply joking he will get gain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> In Manchester across the street from the temple there's a big park. Sometimes I would go over there to walk and chant rounds, and there's many little children in the park. They'd follow me, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa!" All day. Hundred times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Everywhere. In Bombay, everywhere we go, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." In Montreal. They joke, they'll clap, but they'll chant. And that is wanted. I want to see that everyone is chanting. And if chanting has effect, then either he's chanting jokingly or seriously it will have the effect. Fire, if you touch either jokingly or seriously or cautiously, it will act. So our request is that you also preach this cult. Let us cooperate. The whole world is suffering for want of God consciousness. So it is the duty of all religious sects to teach this simple art of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa or any other name which you have got. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They have got this prayer, "Lord Jesus have mercy on me, a miserable sinner." And she was showing me they have a, almost like <span class="Italic">japa</span> beads. Show him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You see, here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They're almost like <span class="Italic">japa mālā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We do it in some, together, in the orthodox church. And we take turns doing two hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And... These are for counting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. We also do the same thing. We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, what is the wording?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "Have mercy on us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a little prayer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And they also pray to the mother of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sinful? "We are sinful?" You say, "sinful" something? "Forgive some sins" or something like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us." That is the prayer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And you say it in your own language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. "Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, have mercy on us." That's nice. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. Now, the, by praying, it is expected that one should have mercy of God. So what is the test that he has got the mercy of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The mercy of God is the love of God, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Mercy of... So... That is the test, that he has learned how to love God. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.53]<span class="Italic">.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also worshiped, that "You can give love of God." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa prema-pradāya te. Namo mahā-vadānyāya.</span> "You are the most munificent of all incarnations because You are distributing love of God." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.53]<span class="Italic">. Kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne.</span> "You are Kṛṣṇa in the form of devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So I offer my respects." This is Rūpa Gosvāmī's prayer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Do you find that you chant, it clarifies you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, certainly. God and God's name, and God or God's son, they are nondifferent. So either I be in touch with God's son or God's name, I am in touch with God. But they are nondifferent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What happens to your mind? What do you do with your mind when you chant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be in my mind, it doesn't matter. My mind may be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Where does it have to be? It has to be fixed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> What will the mind be doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> While chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> What should the mind be doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My mind should be absorbed in God consciousness. That is, that is the effect. He can think of God only, nothing else. That is the effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's very difficult to think of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is not difficult. It is difficult for the sinners. Those who are not sinners, it is not difficult. Because in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvanda-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One can chant the holy name of the Lord if one is free from all sinful activities. A person who is engaged in sinful activities, he cannot concentrate. Therefore we ask our students, first discipline is that he must not have illicit sex life, he must not eat meat, he must not take any kind of intoxication, he must not indulge in gambling. Because these are sinful activities. So if one is engaged in these sinful activities, he cannot concentrate. It is impossible. One who is sinner, he cannot concentrate his mind on God. So voluntarily we should give up these sinful activities. Then it will be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There's a lot more ...sins than just those four things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These are the four principles of sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If you're irritated with somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> She says if you're irritated with somebody, this is also a sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Your mind can be filled with this kind of sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Irritated... If your mind is in peace... If you are not indulging in intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, then your mind will not be irritated. How a gambler can be in peaceful mind? That is not possible. How a drunkard can be in peaceful mind? Agitation is for them who are simply engaged in sinful life. Those who are not engaged in sinful life, naturally they are peaceful. Their mind is not agitated. Vegetarians are naturally peaceful. Just see between a dog and a cow. (laughter). Dog unnecessarily will talk: "Gow! Gow! Gow! Gow!" (makes barking sound) without any fault. "Why you are here? Why you are here? Why you are here?" That is dog's qualification. A cow, so useful animal, it will never agitate. The dog has no use, but still he's the best friend. (laughter) And cow, actually giving us milk, sending to the slaughterhouse. Just see. This is human civilization. A dog is worshiped, and a cow is slaughtered. Do you think it is civilization? Do you think? Can you support this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, I had a friend who was a vegetarian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from this, these two animals. One is dog, and another is cow. So dog is worshiped and cow is sent to the slaughterhouse. What kind of civilization it is? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Less than! Cow is supporting the whole society with milk. Every morning, without milk, we cannot live. The child, without milk, cannot live. She should be treated as mother. And they are being sent to the slaughterhouse. And still, they are thinking of becoming free from sinful life. Can anyone kill his own mother? "Oh, mother is old and useless. Let her be killed. Burden." Is that very gratitude for the mother by the son?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They do that. As soon as the cow is too old to give milk, immediately slaughterhouse. I was talking to one man, he was a cowherdsman here in England. He said he couldn't stand it. He said a nice cow, she would get old, she couldn't give milk anymore, immediately slaughterhouse. Just like that. The most disgusting thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (people coming in) Oh. You come forward. Give him seat. Śivānanda, you come... You can sit there. Yes. So the God consciousness can be awakened if you stop sinful activities. Otherwise, it is impossible. You go on preaching for millions of years; there will be no God consciousness. There will be no God consciousness. That is the... in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> (people sitting down) Why? You can come here, this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You can sit here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has finished sinful activities, he can be engaged in God consciousness. One who is engaged in sinful activities, he cannot. Devil citing scripture. A devīl cannot cite scripture. Angel can cite scripture. And according to our <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī, he says that "Don't hear scriptures from the devīl." <span class="Italic">Avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtaṁ śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyam.</span>" If a devīl's preaching about God, don't hear." If you say, "God is pure, so let me hear about God. It doesn't matter whether he is devīl or angel. It doesn't matter." No. The argument is <span class="Italic">sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payo yathā.</span> Just like milk is very nourishing food, but if it is touched by the lips, by the tongue of a serpent, it becomes poison. <span class="Italic">Sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payo yathā.</span> You cannot bring the milk which is touched by the serpent's tongue. So we should receive knowledge of God, message of God, from a person who is not a devīl. Then it will be effective. Otherwise, it will act as poison. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's principle is <span class="Italic">āpani ācari prabhu jīveri śikṣāya.</span> He first of all behaves himself, and then he preaches. So if the preacher is sinful, how he can deliver other sinful men by his so-called preaching. That is not possible. He must be pure, he must be sinless. Then his preaching will be effective. But in all conditions, if we, with faith and love we chant the holy name of God, we shall become gradually purified. There is no, I mean to say, cause of anxiety. Anyone who will chant this holy name, he'll be purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That line, <span class="Italic">jaya sakal vipod bhaktivinod bolen jakhon o nām gāy.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">O nām gāy,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> All obstacles will go away if you chant the holy name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> there are four classes of men who deride at God and four classes of men who approaches God.</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Atheist class of men, who are always engaged in sinful activities, and therefore fools... They don't believe in the next life. Therefore they are fools. There is next life. They say, "Oh, we don't care for next life. Let us do whatever we like." That is a foolish proposition. Because there is next life. Just like a man he becomes irresponsible. He says, "I don't care for government or law. I can do whatever I like." That means he's risking his life. As soon as he'll be arrested, he'll be punished. Therefore he's <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> rascal. Anyone who is defying the kingdom of God, he's a rascal. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">. Narādhamāḥ,</span> is lowest of the mankind. God consciousness is meant for human beings, and if a person defies God, then he's the lowest of the mankind. <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> His knowledge has been plundered by the illusory energy. He may be academically a very big title holder, but if he's not God conscious, then his knowledge has been taken away. Real knowledge has been taken away. <span class="Italic">Asuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> These are the symptoms of the atheist class of men. So on the whole, at the present moment, God consciousness must be spread if actually they want peace and prosperity. And those who are in charge of religion, religion means God consciousness. Everyone should combine to spread God consciousness. That is the immediate necessity at the present moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> People find it very difficult today...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not difficult. It is just like this, I gave you this example. Three years or two years before it was difficult. And it is not difficult. It has to be trained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For people outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> People outside, she says, they find it difficult even to believe in God now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore propaganda is required. They are rascal fools, but we are not rascal and fools. We must preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, you can't preach until you are purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, purification will go on. Suppose you are... Just like we are holding, what I... I began this propaganda in the Western countries. I was sitting in a park, Thompkinson's? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Thompkins Square.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thompkins Square in New York. I was simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and they used to gather. And gradually, they became my disciples, students. So I began in this way, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare... For three hours, from two to five. That's all. And they are still doing that. They are going on the street. This Hare Kṛṣṇa, the same thing, is going on. They are being arrested sometimes. They are being harassed. But still, they don't give up. They chant. This boy in Germany, I sent in Germany. He sat down on the footpath and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. This boy. Practically, he started my European movement, he started first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) Gentlemen:</span> Have you been harassed in London at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think, but they are Londoners. They know better than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, we have been harassed many times. We have been arrested and left from the prison about twelve o'clock, one o'clock in the night, and then we were far from that place to here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The last time was a week ago. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Would you say that the Americans are generally less tolerant than Londoners to you or more tolerant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> America or here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. Which is the worse and which is the better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> America is more tolerant, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> More tolerant. (laughs) America is more tolerant. But they're not arresting now, you see, and wherever they go, they chant freely, but here almost every week we are arrested on the streets and harassed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is it because possibly because you are less well known over here than in America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No. Because a very conservative legal system and obsolete laws, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What law can arrest you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, we fought this out in the court here and the magistrate allowed that we can chant. There is no law who can stop chanting. But the police, authorities, they say, well, "You are obstructing the traffic." And under that we are arrested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can find out anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> An excuse. It's an excuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "Blocking the traffic, disturbing the peace..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Anyway, the original purpose of America was to have religious freedom. Therefore they left England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> There is constitutional guarantee...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So they still have some respect for people who are trying to glorify God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In American in every court case, we win. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, we lost here several times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Last, year, when we went to the police authorities for our procession here, and we wanted to make three <span class="Italic">rathas</span> and the police officer, he was so envious, he said, "No. There is no law, we can put three <span class="Italic">rathas</span> on the street." We said, "What is the harm? Won't you give us protection?" "So many people will be dying and killed under the <span class="Italic">ratha.</span> If the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> is so big and all that. People will be killed." I said, "They are big all over the world. This is for God consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many people are dying by motor accidents, but do they stop motor car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">English guest:</span> Do you think the situation will get better in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Wherever there is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa going on, things will get better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Say, if the average London policeman, if he could be convinced to chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Convinced? No. Some of them are less hostile, some of them more hostile, naturally. We can chant on one side of Oxford St., but we cannot chant on the other side of the street because there's two different police departments. It's like that. There is no hard and fast way to figure it out. You just have to try it and see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One night at Picadilly Circus we were eight and four were arrested, and four other people, no, they let them go. So I said, "No, I was arrested." (laughter) When they went to the court, Prabhupāda, they got one pound five each... They were altogether eight, and four were arrested. They also doing the same offense. It is same offense. So he said, "All right, let them go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Can I ask about your rate... about growth? How, can ask how the movement is growing? Can you give me any figures at all? I was speaking to one of your colleagues earlier who mentioned 150, but seventy-five approximately which were in London. Are the figures growing week by week?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I started this movement alone, and now there are eight thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'm talking about in Britain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Same thing. Yes, every few days somebody joins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Can you tell me how many of those actually stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, 99% stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And what is the figure likely to be? Five a week, ten a week?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't keep any statistics, but actually the fact is that I started alone; now we are eight thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'm sorry, I didn't quite get that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Five years ago, Prabhupāda, he came to New York with these <span class="Italic">kartāls,</span> and he began alone by sitting in a park underneath a tree chanting this very same Hare Kṛṣṇa, which you see the boys on Oxford St. chanting. And now there are eight thousand students all over the world, and approximately a hundred centers. At that time, Śrīla Prabhupāda didn't even have a place for himself. But now he has a place in every major city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You used the word "student" here. You're referring to this as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, because it's an education. This is a spiritual education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This doesn't tie up with the figure that I've been given, though, 150. There must be more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, we're talking about around the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But you would accept there's 150?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, five years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, England we started in 1968.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That 150 is those who have fully dedicated their life, but there are thousands who are followers and admirers who have not joined here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are admirers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They are admirers and they are... there are thousands of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Encouraging people to chant the name of God in their own religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You don't have to change your religion. Like we are Christians. In the orthodox church, they say that (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> To be a member you don't have to change your religion? Is this a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> To be a member, here a member here, you do, don't you? Or do you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> To live in this temple you have to take up fully our principles and take up our activities of preaching work and like that. But to practice these things outside, even in one's own religion, without changing the basis of his belief, he can simply devote himself to God in these ways. And if one is young and not so attached, he can take it up fully. He can take it up in part, or he can take it up... And religious system, there are names of God. You simply chant it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct) an associate member if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I've only just (indistinct) asking about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Everyone is a member...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If you're a member, you have to practice the whole thing obviously. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Everyone is a member of this movement. But some people have forgotten. Our movement is to remind them. Every living being is by nature a servant of God. Now people are forgetting. We want them to remember. We don't care for some difference of technique in worship. We want people to take up the business of chanting the names of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just as in the same family some of the sons have forgotten father and some of them remember, but both of them member of the same family. Because he has forgotten his father does not mean that he is not son. He still remains. So actually, everyone is a member of God's family. That is our vision. Not only human being, but animals also. We therefore consider animals also brothers. We don't support animal killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct) in your four principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> We follow strictly these four principles. Just like this: no animal killing, no eating of animal foodstuff including meat, fish and eggs; don't take any kind of intoxicant, even tea, coffee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You're still on number one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, that's number two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Let me get number one first. No animal killing, yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And no animal slaughter, no taking of animal foodstuffs including meat, fish, or eggs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No animal foodstuff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Milk we have, surely. We don't have to kill the animal to take the milk. Meat, fish and eggs we don't take. No intoxications of any kind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You're on number two now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Number two. No intoxication. That includes even tea, coffee, cigarettes, very strictly. No gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You're on three now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Number three, no gambling. And number four, no illicit sex life. That means no sex life whatsoever outside of marriage. And in marriage, sex life is to beget children and raise them to love God. So we follow these four principles very strictly. In this way we purify our lives and then we can develop spiritual emotion of love of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Uh, let's look at the... I quite see these four principles. I wonder if one could look at it slightly from a positive side. You said no animal killing, slaughter and no intoxicants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> These are four "nos."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. Fine. Fine. Let's look at the "yes's." What exactly can you eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> We can eat anything: fruit, vegetables, milk products, grains, sugar, nuts, all kinds of vegetable foodstuffs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Broadly speaking, anything that comes out of the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. And we can eat it after it's been offered to the Lord with love and devotion. This we call <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> or Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, any foodstuff is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Any foodstuff is Kṛṣṇa's, God's mercy. Just like grain. You cannot manufacture grain. It is by God's mercy you get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Have you any view on food that's been (indistinct) insects are killed, insecticide? Sort of thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, our point is to get the nicest foodstuff available and prepare it nicely for Kṛṣṇa, offer it to Kṛṣṇa, and then distribute it. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I quite appreciate with respect the clause on alcohol. I'm puzzled, though, why anything on cigarettes. I'm puzzled about tea and coffee frankly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Stimulants and depressants of all kinds, mild or strong, doesn't make any difference. You're taking a stimulant or a depressant, or a cigarette or a drink of coffee. It will agitate your mind with a chemical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So what can you drink?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Milk, water, fruit juices, so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If you don't get cigarettes, you won't die. If you don't get cigarettes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Oh no, no, I wouldn't question that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's the point. They are unnecessary, artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We're so used to tea and coffee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Gambling I understand. The attitude to sex and so on is really fundamental to the Catholic attitude, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But does the Catholic church allow tea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I was talking about basic, those who are involved in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's fundamentally a God conscious attitude, that this body, this human body is meant for spiritual realization. The fact that the body has got sexual desire, therefore we make a concession for that. We use it for begetting good children. If one wants to marry, he can marry and have good children, and raise them to love God. But the real purpose of human life is not just to enjoy sex life like the cats and dogs. Human life has got a higher purpose. So therefore we believe that our human energy should be utilized in that way, for reducing the eating, the sleeping, the sex life. Reducing these things to the minimum, as much as necessary, rather than as much as possible. And having as much as necessary, that leaves most of our time and energy for cultivating our God consciousness. See what I mean? Therefore the idea is that sex life is the highest happiness for man, we don't subscribe to that. It's the biggest happiness in this material world. But spiritual life means unending happiness. A human being can experience this. The dog or cat can't. So for them there is eating, sleeping, sex life, defending themselves. But a human being can experience higher pleasure in God consciousness. So we think that... Therefore we use our energy in that direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So it isn't a negation of pleasure, but it's a higher pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Can I ask...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is very important point, that we are not negating pleasure, but we are trying to bring them to the highest pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> She made this observation, that this is not to stop our enjoying, but this is higher enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> When you come into this movement, you come in from on the outside, in the material world and so on. Do you, as some monks do in monasteries, do you give all your wealth, all your possessions, everything, as it were, to the movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not necessarily. But generally yes. Because we're coming here to serve Kṛṣṇa and we understand that everything is Kṛṣṇa's. So whatever we come with is automatically Kṛṣṇa's, so we use it in His service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, we don't possess anything. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's. What we possess, so-called possession, that is illegal. Because I cannot possess your property. I can possess your property by stealing. Not by fair dealings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So it's a voluntary thing, really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I can possess it if you give it to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is nice. So that is our philosophy. <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Whatever God has given you, you possess. Don't try to possess other's property. <span class="Italic">Mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam.</span> Everything belongs to God, so whatever God gives me, you enjoy it. I take it. I don't encroach upon other's property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You use your own, responsibly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I should feel grateful. "Oh, God has given me this thing, so whatever utility is there, first of all I must offer to God." God has given me this grain to eat, so I must cook and first of all offer to God, and then I shall eat." This is feeling gratitude, grateful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Would you use, say, cars if it were given you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If someone gives us an automobile would we use it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Just like this tape recorder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because originally, everything is possession of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If you had a big house, a rich house. You would use that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We shall turn into temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately. (laughter) We are searching after. If you can give, it will be very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> To put beautiful things in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Wherever we shall go, we cannot go without God. So if we get a palatial house, immediately make a very gorgeous, nice temple, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance. That's all. We can utilize anything. Because everything is belonging to God. So as soon as we get something, we utilize it for God. That is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Who controls, if one of the members becomes grasping, wants things for himself...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what... We are therefore teaching. We are therefore teaching. Members are gradually learning how to sacrifice for God. So when he is completely trained up, he knows that nothing belongs to Him. Everything belongs to God. Therefore, whatever he possesses, it must be utilized for God's purposes. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or God consciousness. We take it for granted, and that is a fact. Everything belongs to God. God, whatever God has given me for my use, so I must use it, first of all expressing my gratitude to God, "O God, You are so kind that You have given me this. So first of all you taste it. Then I'll eat." This is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What about pleasures like listening to music?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we chant the glories of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Could you listen to other peoples' music?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No. If he's chanting the glories of God, we are very eager to hear him. That is our process. Or somebody's chanting, somebody's hearing. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇu.</span> Chanting and hearing about God, that is music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, a Beethoven symphony, for example, could you listen to that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Beethoven's symphony. He means classical Western music. They make some music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if it is glorification of God, we can hear. There is no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But there may be no reference to God in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then we don't hear. We reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Inspired by God, given by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Given by God is everything. That is another thing. Just like everything is government property. But do you like to go to the prisonhouse? We say everything belongs to government. We are not so liberal, that "Because everything belongs to government, therefore I shall go to the prisonhouse."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'm sorry, I didn't get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I take everything is good because it belongs to God, but you do choose, in fact, or you wouldn't choose to waste your time when you should be doing something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But for God's cause we can go. Just like these boys are sometimes arrested and put into jail. That is God's cause. But they are not prepared to go to the jail by pickpocketing. That is not their mission. They are executing God's business and if somebody puts him into jail, "All right. It is God's desire. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The point is that there must be direct connection with God. If God's name is there, if God's service is there, if God's form is there, then we are interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa sambandhe.</span> Everything must be related with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, if you're relaxing, if you need to relax, and you sit and listen to some music, it doesn't say praise God all the time, but in fact is, because it's beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't accept anything beautiful without God. Without God, everything is ugly to us. Everything ugly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So you have to bless it by offering it to God first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Just like we have so many beautiful songs and melodies and everything. They're very nice. And we sing these songs. They are glorifying the Lord. And we enjoy like that. Music is there, everything is there, but because it is directly in the devotional service of God, therefore there is this <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> there is this devotion there. Devotion to God. Without that, everything becomes void. Tasteless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Can I get one point straight? Is the Beethoven symphony all right provided it is blessed as an object and a work of art. Is it then all right? Or is it not all right because it doesn't use religious themes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Originally, music and art were employed only to glorify the Lord in the scripture and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In <span class="Italic">Sāma-veda, Sāma-veda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Gradually, if you study our history, music history, God was left out. Just like you will see landscapes, and there's nothing in there about God. It was left out. But originally the landscape, there was some depiction of the activities of God or His representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So a Beethoven symphony is not all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's not a matter of Beethoven symphony. Art means to glorify God. If God is in the... Just like this picture. There is a mountain, there is sky, but what is the point there? The point is Kṛṣṇa. There's a book, but the point is the spiritual master. Here's a landscape, but the point is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The original point I'm trying to get at...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If there is some music, you must hear something about God's activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But suppose that was a beautiful landscape on its own, just the landscape, then it's worthless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Limited and temporary enjoyment only. Limited and temporary enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But you accept that the temporary enjoyment is there, would you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. And limited and temporary. It's called <span class="Italic">capala sukha,</span> flickering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, even there was no God's picture, one who is God conscious, he can see in the natural scenery presentation, he can see, "Oh, how God is artistic. How he has manufactured this flower, how he has painted, how He has made this tree." So that is higher intelligence. That is higher intelligence. Because without God, there can be nothing existing. So one has to learn how to see God in everything. That is another thing. That is higher status. Yes. But in the lower status of God consciousness one is advised that you should not see anything without God. But in the higher status, there is nothing in the world which is without God. But we should not imitate the higher status of life in the lower status of our position. Otherwise, one who has learned about God, he can see God in this flower. Actually, how God's hand has worked out this nice flower. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> God says, <span class="Italic">raso 'ham apsu kaunteya [Bg. </span>7.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like I am drinking water. In the taste of the water I'll see God. God says, Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the taste of the water." And actually, that taste cannot be created by man. The taste in the water, that is God's gift. So as soon as I taste the water, immediately I should remember, "Oh, here is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So we believe that the holy spirit empowers artists and composers. And therefore we would say that a symphony was a creation of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Creation... In everything there is hand of God. Therefore one who has learned to see everything in connection with God, he sees God everywhere, every moment. (knock) Yes? <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti. Premāñjana cchurita</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one has developed love of God, he sees God everywhere, always. Because everything is creation of God; so he can find out, "Here is my Lord. Here is my Lord. Here is my Lord." That is the highest state of loving God. He cannot see anything without connection of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a matter of attitude who created this (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a matter of your attitude.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not attitude. Development of my God consciousness. Attitude may be artificial. But it is actual development of God consciousness. God consciousness is there in everybody. It requires simply to be developed. Just like a child. A child has got love within her, within his heart. But when he is young, it develops. It develops. And the girl, boy, automatically becomes attached because that propensity has developed. It is not an artificial thing. It was already there. It has to be developed. So God consciousness is there in everyone's heart. Otherwise, how these boys are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? Unless Kṛṣṇa was there within. Artificially you cannot force them, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Do you believe you (indistinct) people, if they hear it? If they hear this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As they hear, they became purified, and that dormant consciousness becomes awakened. Yes. Awakened. That chance we are giving. We are chanting and others are hearing. By this process, chanting and hearing, both of us will be benefited, awakening our original God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> At the stage of awakening, when you're waking up, when you're becoming cured of the diseased condition, you sometimes have to restrict your diet. Later on, when you are healthy, you can take all kinds of foodstuffs in the proper way. But while you're getting over a disease you have to restrict your diet. Therefore we hear things that are directly concerned with Kṛṣṇa's name, form, activities. Later on, then we'll be able to see God in a flower, God in everywhere. Otherwise we'll see the flower however we enjoy a flower because we're not at that healthy stage. So therefore there are regulations that we follow for curing the disease. That means for a little while we restrict the diet. Then when we're healthy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like these flowers. These flowers the devotees are bringing to their spiritual master, to God. They are not enjoying. Ordinary man, if he gets a flower, he'll put it in the pocket. How... You see? That is the difference of God consciousness. The flower is the same, but use is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What's your view, if I may ask, on, for emotion in, of, an ideal, a Christian ideal and so on through the media. Will you use television and radio to condemn things like racial intolerance and the Vietnam War? Do you believe that you should become involved in these things? Could you issue a statement and say that the movement condemns so and so? Do you believe getting into anything in the world spectrum to comment on things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Do you follow the question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? His question is do we concern ourselves with particular problems in the world, there's the war in Vietnam, there's racial discrimination? Do we make statements to condemn this war or to condemn that discrimination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Thing is that there are so many problems. Our proposition is, when you become God conscious, then all problems automatically solved. We don't take the problems. We take the... Just like disease. There are many symptoms. A man is suffering from a particular disease. He has a headache, he has this pain, this pain, that pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You go down to the heart of the matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> To the root cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They're only symptoms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are all different symptoms of the society's being materially diseased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Society isn't saved in a month by individuals, (indistinct) the reality in each person. It's more than an example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Pour the water to the root cause and in every leaf it goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So the answer is you do not comment on it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahād guṇā</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one is Godless, he cannot have any good qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Supposing somebody has got smallpox. Smallpox means sores appear on the body and very high fever also. So one doctor who's less intelligent says, "He's got a fever because he has sores." So he puts medicine on the sores. Sores go away and the man dies. Another doctor says, "He's got sores and a fever. This means he has got smallpox." So he gives him some medicine to cure the disease, and then the sores automatically go away. The root cause of all... There are so many troubles in the world. The root cause is Godlessness. People are not God conscious. If that is there, it will automatically put everything in the right perspective and everybody will be able to live harmoniously and peacefully because they will be satisfied and happy in themselves. Then they can live together peacefully and happily. Otherwise, it's all artificial attempts, and the patient will die when you just treat the symptoms. That's happening. For hundreds of years there's been wars and things. There have also been peace movements. Have the peace movements stopped the wars? It hasn't happened. Because they... With one side they're trying to stop the sickness, on the other side they're fanning the sickness, they're stimulating, like in materialistic activities. There's got to be a basic change of heart. Then things can change in detail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But you will not comment on the details themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Sometimes, if it has relevance for preaching work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Do you think it would not be helpful to say that there's no comment. To say that the whole of mankind is one and we're treating the disease in the human heart (indistinct) You can't do it by an overall (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, I agree. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We condemn wars but we fight each other. We are covetous on all different coarse levels. Until we've cured that in our own heart, we can't have the faith to say, "God, stop this war."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> There's a saying, "charity begins at home." (end)</div>
