<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava ācāra.</span> [break] ...how nice. This kind of building cannot be constructed. It will require <span class="Italic">crores</span> of money, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> [break] ...nobody. Only (indistinct) would come here, they would stay here for a few hours and then go back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The tank is not with water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Yes, they used to have water at both sides of the inside. Now, probably, they are short of water or they have switched on to agriculture. So many they used to have flowers and <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> and all that. Now they have come to agriculture-wheat, barley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money. Such a nice tank is vacant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> I remember my young days. People, young boys, they used to come swim here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Just see. So you may pay them, say, 150, 200 rupees each. Then it will be all maintained, and that much money you can spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> And if it's nicely maintained, possibility you can get some return out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That way we shall get fruits and flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> I was seeing yesterday in Rādhā-Dāmodara Mandira that nothing is nicely maintained except for your rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Rādhā-Dāmodara temple (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Oldest place in Vṛndāvana. I am not even aspirant of religion or psychology, but people are very much interested in Hinduism there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> [break] ...should have a nice path all the way around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We should buy some for you, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can buy the whole thing. (Hindi) I'll talk with him. (Hindi-Prabhupāda bargaining with chili seller in long exchange) You have got money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha(?):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) So give him two rupees, eight annas. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Bargain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My father used to do that. He'd go to a vegetable vendor. He has got a big basket, and he'll say, "What do you want for all, the whole basket." So he is ready because he'll sit down so long, so at very cheap rate he'll give it. And it was not required in the family so much. My mother became very angry, that "You are bringing so many, so much vegetable, it is being spoiled." But he would purchase like that. If you give him in those days fifty rupees to go to the market, he will spend all the money and bring at home. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) We are prepared to spend. [break] ...from saintly person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrajavāsī:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol. Jaya!</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrajavāsī:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Rādhārāṇī <span class="Italic">ki!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrajavāsī:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrajavāsī:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol. Haribol. Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Oh, when our festival?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Sixth, seventh, and eighth. Tomorrow, next day, and the Rāma-navamī. (Hindi-break)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> it says that if a person cannot offer a straw mat like that to a saintly person when he visits, he doesn't live in a house...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he hasn't got extra straw, how can he do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> He may offer obeisances. If he can't do that, simply cry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Straw? Straw is offered. Oh, not taken care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> You said if he couldn't, if he cannot do that, he does not live in a house, but he lives in a tree full of snakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So he has offered seat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> it says that although Lord Viṣṇu is the controller of everything, He is particularly in charge with the mode of goodness, and He is associated with maintenance. So is it that in order to maintain something in this material world also, there has to be the touch of the mode of goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Verse">tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye<br class="calibre2"/>ceta etair anāviddhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.19]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">When the heart is cleansed of the dirty things, <span class="Italic">rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ,</span> the modes of <span class="Italic">rajaḥ</span> and <span class="Italic">tamaḥ,</span> ignorance and passion, then he is situated in the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> There are three <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span> If you become released from the <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa,</span> naturally you are situated in the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Evaṁ prasanna-manaso?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ</span> [SB 1.2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he becomes <span class="Italic">prasanna-manasaḥ,</span> happy mood. Then he can cultivate devotional service. Otherwise not possible. <span class="Italic">Ceta etair anāviddhaṁ sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati.</span> Unless one is situated in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> there is no possibility of peacefulness.
