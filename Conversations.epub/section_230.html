<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Easygoing, that is actual real life. But that easygoing, you must come to that stage. If you come to a healthy stage, then when you eat you can digest nicely. But unhealthy stage, if you eat, how you will digest? Therefore, you have to cure your disease first of all. Then you eat, it will be digested. So in the material condition, nothing can be (indistinct). Therefore, how it is called conditioned life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> We're bound up by so many conditions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah, the conditions. So first of all you come out of the conditioned life. Just like we are trying to go to other planets with so many machines, so many mechanical arrangements. But if you have got spiritual body, you can go anywhere. Anywhere you can go. As Nārada Muni is going, traveling, any planet he likes he is going. That freedom is there, but that is in spiritual body. So you come to the spiritual body first, then you get all freedom. Whatever you like, you can do. Whatever you desire, you can get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Just like Śrīla Prabhupāda gives the example like Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it might look like poison at the beginning, but at the end it will be nectar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> And so they..., they're reversing that, these people who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is stated in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā.</i> What is appearing as poison in the beginning, that will prove nectar at the end. [break] Even ordinary dealings. Just like I have given one watch to Śyāmasundara, that Omega. So I paid him... One hundred dollars has been spent to make it correct time, but it is not. Everyone, "Yes, I will make it repaired."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Just repairing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Repairing, four, five dollars, six dollars, and it is the same. And it is going on for the last one year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Like automobiles, automobiles are built to break down in four or five years at the most so that you'll have to go and buy a new one. That's the way they build them. They could make them stronger, stronger parts, stronger engines, but they don't, so that in four or five years they'll break down and you'll have to come back and buy a new one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Sanskrit) Even in ordinary dealings, people will cheat you. That is stated in the <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</i> (Sanskrit) Everyone is cheating. Even in ordinary talking, they will tell so many lies. [break] They live nicely in fresh air, in open air, trees, and talking about their business and they are happy. They have no problems for eating, sleeping, mating, nothing. Everything is there. And we are claiming civilized. We are dealing with science to improve conditions, the rascals they are becoming more and more degraded. They have no science, they have no laboratory, they have no university. How they are living peacefully? So it is... If this life is better or this life of cheating and imperfectness, full of anxieties, this life is better. Which life is better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> The animals, they are living by the arrangement of nature, they live according to their nature. Whereas the human beings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They have no anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> ...perform prohibited activities and requirements and are living actually against their own nature. So the animal's life in that sense is better. At least they're not performing any sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That I explained last time, that they are simply misusing their advancement, and they are satisfied when they have got a motorcar instead of bullock cart. That's all. They think, "Now I am advanced. We had bullock cart, now we have got motorcar with three hundred thousand parts. And every part will give me trouble as soon as it is (indistinct)," (chuckles) and that is advancement. As soon as one part is broken, the bullock cart is called for. They get a bullock cart to carry this motorcar. [break] Everyone is servant. Therefore, we teach our students to address <i class="calibre3">"prabhu."</i> "I am your servant, you are my master, <i class="calibre3">prabhu.</i>" That is the meaning of prabhu. <i class="calibre3">Prabhu </i>means master. And Prabhupāda means supreme master. That is the meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> In this country there's a saying that everyone should be their own master. That's the philosophy. It's called individualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Own master... He does not know how to become own master. That he does not know. He speaks only. Now, what is their explanation to become own master? How they explain? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> The idea is that they want to be... to determine their own destiny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> They want to determine their own destiny. They think if they work very hard, they'll be able to build up their environment... (noise of plane taking off).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is not explanation. Own master means master of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> That they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Actually, everyone is servant of the senses at the present moment. So one has to become the master of the senses. That is called <i class="calibre3">svāmī</i>. <i class="calibre3">Svāmī</i> means master. <i class="calibre3">Gosvāmī</i> means master of the senses, the same thing. So everyone is servant of the senses. Everyone is acting being dictated by the senses. "Oh, it is very nice. Let me see." The eyes dictate what we see. What is time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Five after seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Five minutes after seven. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">(In car:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> We were given a ride by some young people, a couple, and they were..., this was in Bakersfield, California. They said that a <i class="calibre3">mahārāja</i> of Guru Maharaj-ji, a <i class="calibre3">mahātmā</i>, they called him a <i class="calibre3">mahātmā,</i> a disciple follower of this fourteen-year-old so-called <i class="calibre3">avatāra,</i> is in Bakersfield, and he's staying there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where he is now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> He's supposed to still be in Bakersfield after Guru Maharaj-ji, but this <i class="calibre3">mahātmā</i> is his follower. But they were very anxious to follow in his way because Guru Maharaj-ji is supposed to give direct perception of God. It's described that he will show you light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Yes. They said when you meet him, he can show you light. He's giving direct understanding of God in this way, this light. When I tried to ask them to understand some Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they simply refused to listen. They had no desire to hear about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They said, "What your spiritual master has to offer? What can you offer except just some scriptures?" They had no respect for the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i> So many young people are following this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha: </b>Everyone wants instant realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Outlaws will say like that. "What education you have got? You have simply studied some lawbook." Outlaws will say like that. They will simply sell some book, "Now we are better that you. Without studying we have written."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> That's why they are called demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> They are called demons because... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct) here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Yes, they're in Hollywood. I've never seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> They have a place in Hollywood. I've never seen it, but I know people who have gone there. They become like a fad, like Maharishi. Two years ago he was very big, thousands of people were coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> This Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He was very big. He was in the newspapers and thousands of people came and paid thirty-five dollars, took initiation. But now you don't hear anything about him. So this man will come, make a big show, make some money, but in two years he'll just be a memory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct) Why does he not come again? He has gone forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> You have said that whenever there is Kṛṣṇa there will be success everywhere, all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> When there is Kṛṣṇa, there will be success everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is the real success. (indistinct) There are so many places I see the sign for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Yes, they are one of the biggest corporations in the United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Accha?</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> They're one of the biggest corporations in the United States. They have a..., at least one or two thousand of those, I think more than two thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> They're all across the country. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Colonel Sanders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Many thousands of chickens are being killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Oh, millions of chickens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Millions every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Just like this MacDonald's hamburger stands, they have a sign in front of their hamburger stands-they have also several thousand hamburger stands-the sign says, "Over ten billion hamburgers served." Their company has served ten billion hamburgers. [break] (Outside walking:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Yes. He told me he was very pleased to see Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he said he will start chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. He said he will go to Laguna Beach temple and he said he will try out chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> He told me that he could see that this knowledge wasn't theoretical, that it was realized knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> He told me that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> That the knowledge that you have isn't theoretical but it's realized. He was very much impressed by that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> He liked the <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i> so much that I made another plate and he finished that. Then after that he took the..., he finished the... What is that preparation from eggplant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> The vegetable, he really liked that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Yes, he finished all plate, he liked so much. He said, "What is this?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Gradually try to convince him and let him read our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> We are in the same floor. He works on the physics side, I am in chemistry side, but we are in the same floor, fourth floor of the building. No, he is on the third floor. So Śrīla Prabhupāda is saying that prove the existence of Kṛṣṇa by the science of physics, your knowledge. So he asked me, how am I going to prove the existence of Kṛṣṇa by chemistry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That requires your knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> But he agreed the existence of supreme brain. We were talking about the talk between Einstein, Heisenberg, and some of the famous so-called physicists in nuclear field. So there was a conversation between Einstein and this Heisenberg, and Paul Durad(?), and (?), these are mostly (?) scientists, they are mostly Nobel Laureates. They were discussing, and without Einstein, these people they were talking, "Why Einstein is all the time talking about God?" Then this Heisenberg, he was not like Einstein. Einstein himself, he believed that there is a brain behind, supreme brain of God. And some of them, specifically this one, young Durad(?), he is also a scientist, he was very young, he was only twenty-five years old. So he said, "Einstein is all the time talking about God." This Durad(?) is completely opposite to this Einstein. So they were discussing about why Einstein is thinking about God all the time. And so... But ultimately they said, most of them agreed that there is a supreme being who is making all these physical laws, natural laws. It's already in the universe, but they are trying to discover it. So most of them agree except this Durad(?). So in the same line, (?) told me that yes, we agree that all the physical laws is already there. If somebody doesn't make it, then how can it exist? So he said he is thinking also in that line that there is someone, some brain, some supreme brain who is making all these physical laws. Otherwise there cannot be physical laws if there is not someone. He was saying that he started thinking in that line too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Sanskrit) He makes everything, but He is not attached. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> ...how do you know that guru is qualified, spiritual master is qualified? Then I said everything is written in the <i class="calibre3">śāstras</i>, so we have to follow according to the injunctions written in the <i class="calibre3">śāstras</i>. So all the qualifications of a pure devotee, of a bona fide guru, is written there. Just like you are a professor of physics in the university. Before you came, you had some qualification, degree of doctors. And then there is a committee to decide you whether you are qualified for the post. So it is selected by a committee of members and then they interview and then they find out your qualifications. If they find that you are qualified for the post, so you are selected as a professor. It's like that in the spiritual field also. There are revealed scriptures and there everything is written what will be the qualification of a guru and then how to choose a bona fide one. So everything is written, you should follow the injunctions of the revealed scriptures accordingly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Committee is his spiritual master, he orders that you do this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> The test is to see how much one is actually following the orders of his spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara:</b> Listening to another so-called guru, everywhere we go, especially in Los Angeles, they always talk of other gurus. They always talk of spiritual knowledge, but they don't find out what the real test is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is your answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara:</b> So we show them our books and say that these are the real scriptures, real quality. The (indistinct) have to be the quality of the spiritual knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How do you explain? You are realized or not? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara:</b> Prabhupāda, when you say that this is the knowledge that's been realized...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that? Why don't you explain? (indistinct) That means they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> One who is developing in spiritual life is becoming detached from material things. These persons who are following other gurus are attached to material things. They're still smoking, having sex life, drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> It's difficult to (indistinct) detached to material things. One should be attached to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That attachment will become. That is the special (indistinct). You cannot be completely detached. If you be detachment from something, you must be attached to something. Otherwise you have no perception(?). So you should be detached from matter and attached to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> The devotee is always offering devotional service to the Supreme Personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, that is (inaudible). Simply by knowledge... Knowledge you must have, but simply theoretical knowledge... Practical manifestation that he's a great devotee. Whenever there is any doubt or question, he will prove by the evidences of <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b>  ...was saying last night to our scientist friend, than Kṛṣṇa is the perfect teacher. The spiritual master is simply repeating perfectly what Kṛṣṇa is saying. So if Kṛṣṇa is saying, "Surrender to Me," then the spiritual master is saying, "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> So in this way, the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa are in complete agreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Thus he becomes the (indistinct) of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara:</b> The other teachers, they don't talk...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>When<b class="calibre4"> </b>is Ekādaśī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Ekādaśī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara: </b>Tuesday is Ekādaśī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Tuesday, tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara: </b>Our calendar says Tuesday. It's obvious when they talk about their teachers that they never talk of service to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore, they have no realization. Our relationship is service. So one who is not engaged in the service of the Supreme, he has no realization. Whatever little realization he  has got, that is called <i class="calibre3">śānta-rasa.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> <i class="calibre3">Dāsya</i> realization is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Dāsya-rasa</i>. (indistinct) [break] ...practical devotee, he cannot become (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha</b>: (indistinct) what you were speaking about yesterday, that if someone claims to be a teacher but he doesn't actually have real knowledge, then he's simply cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara:</b> There's nothing practical that they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara: </b>They say nothing practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means they do not follow any practical. That is their rascaldom. Nothing practical means they do not know what is the practical realization of God. That is their ignorance. And still they are claiming to be teachers. That is cheating. Just like these so-called scientists, they are theorizing, but they cannot practically prove. Therefore, their knowledge is imperfect. <i class="calibre3">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.19]<i class="calibre3">. Jñānavān</i>, the wise, after many, many births' cultivation of knowledge, when he surrenders, that is practical. Simply knowledge is useless, theoretical. When he practically surrenders, that is end of knowledge. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha</b>: (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. This is stated. You don't read <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā?</i> You don't read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rāmeśvara: </b>In class we have, every evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So in the Tenth Chapter it is said, <i class="calibre3">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 10.10]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Do you know this verse? <i class="calibre3">Bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam.</i> "One who is engaged in devotional service with love and faith," <i class="calibre3">buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi,</i> "I give him intelligence." That is stated. <i class="calibre3">Satata-yuktānām, </i>"Twenty-four hours engaged with love and faith in My service, I give him intelligence, not to others." That is the qualification. <i class="calibre3">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi te yena mām upayānti. </i>What kind of intelligence? By which one can come back to home, back to Godhead. Not for material enjoyment, or bluffing or cheating. Not that intelligence. That intelligence also given by Him, indirectly. "If you want to cheat, all right, I will give you how to cheat others." That is material. In the material world, we can cheat. In the spiritual world, there is no question of cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> The intelligence by which we can come to Kṛṣṇa is a special kind of intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is perfect intelligence. Therefore we say Kṛṣṇa is the perfect teacher. In the Fifteenth Chapter, <i class="calibre3">sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</i> [Bg. 15.15]<i class="calibre3"> </i>"I am sitting in everyone's heart. All intelligence, memory, is coming from Me, and forgetfulness also is caused by Me." So He is the supreme controller in every respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Why are some people remembering and some people are forgetting Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> If Kṛṣṇa is the source of both remembrance and forgetfulness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. When Kṛṣṇa sees that "Here is a rascal, so let him forget Me." So He will give him intelligence so that he can forget Kṛṣṇa for good. Not for good-at least for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> That is the desire of the individual soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. <i class="calibre3">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 4.11]<i class="calibre3">.</i> "As one surrenders unto Me, according to that." Real process is surrender. So if you surrender with some reservation, with some ulterior motive, then Kṛṣṇa will give you proportionately intelligence. When you are cent percent without any reservation surrender, then you get all facility, all help from Kṛṣṇa, without asking... Just like a small child, he is fully surrendered unto the parent. The parent looks after all the necessities. He doesn't ask anything. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> [break] ...the six principles of surrender in devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is very important. What is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> (indistinct) minutes to seven. One of the six principles is that our interest must be the same in that we can't have any separate interest outside of the interest of the Lord. So that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is surrender. You have no personal interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> That would be another test of the spiritual master, is that if he has some interest outside of Kṛṣṇa's interest, then we can understand that he isn't surrendered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyone. All these rascals come as guru. They say, "I am Kṛṣṇa." Therefore, he has got his own interest. That is immediately disqualification, that he is a rascal. Kick him in his face, as soon as he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha: </b>If a person is surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, he won't take over Kṛṣṇa's post.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> (indistinct) by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa one gets this bona fide spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Kṛṣṇa is always merciful. He comes Himself also and demands surrender, but we do not do that. That we cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> As you were saying last night, if we had no independence, then there wouldn't be any question of... We'd be just like dull matter. There'd be no difference. So we have that independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> By our misuse of independence, we do not surrender. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> The spiritual master teaches how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha: </b>And it's done by surrendering to the teachings of the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then whatever he teaches is perfect, because to the surrendered soul Kṛṣṇa gives the intelligence. So when he speaks, he speaks perfectly because Kṛṣṇa is dictating, "You do this, you speak like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara</b>: In the <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</i> Caitanya Mahāprabhu says to Sanātana Gosvāmī that spiritual life starts by accepting..., the moment the disciple accepts a spiritual master.

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha: </b>So if someone is sincere, we want them to follow devotional principles. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. If you have the determination, Kṛṣṇa will help. If she is determined that "Even if I die, I shall not smoke," then Kṛṣṇa will help her. And if she thinks, "So I'll not do it. If Kṛṣṇa likes, He will help me." (indistinct) Just like (indistinct). He has prepared some nice foodstuff. So he says, "If Kṛṣṇa comes, I will give Him; otherwise I shall eat." (laughter) "And if Kṛṣṇa is very hungry, He will come." So this alternative proposal is not accepted. "If Kṛṣṇa comes, I will offer Him this. Otherwise I shall eat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> That is personal motivation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is not surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Jayatīrtha:</b> Kṛṣṇa is not attracted by the foodstuff; He's attracted by the devotion.</div>
