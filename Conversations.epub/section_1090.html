<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The following is a conversation held in Śrīla Prabhupāda's room regarding the starting up of yoga courses for tourists in Vṛndāvana and Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are... Just note down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you teach yoga system, they'll pay for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is how it's going to work. We are going to give them free yoga lessons. They will come in our guesthouse and live there. But we have already increased the rate of the room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, this is how all these yoga camps are working. They make their money from the rest, from the rent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who is not going to learn yoga system, then they have to pay increased rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. This is an extra facility. In other words...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, extra facility is... Somebody may be interested in learning yoga, others may not be. So why he should pay more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well we can charge them little more. I am just saying how the other establishments are running because this is the big attraction to get people, and almost every foreigner will be interested in this. This is like... It's not that they are really getting it free because we are covering ourselves by increasing the rates and the restaurant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are covering, but those who are not interested, why they should pay more? That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. But... Yes... But the answer is, we have established a double pricing system, for all foreigners are paying fifteen rupees for single room, twenty-five for double. And the Indians are paying eight and fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they understand that you have got such discrimination, they are dissatisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, what we have done, we have added in various different points like extra bedsheet, one rupee, extra this... We have added in these extra points. So the total does come to fifteen and twenty. I have spoken to all the travel agencies, and they are willing to go along with us. In fact, they think that fifteen and twenty-five is very cheap. But I then explain to them that we can't make it any more because we are in competition with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you don't get customer even lesser than that. First of all see your position. You may calculate in the mind that "This is cheap, this is not," but cheap or no cheap, you are not getting any customers. (chuckling)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, because we never went after the tourist traffic. We have just started going after this foreign traffic with these brochures, and now we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now, in the Sixth Chapter there are forty-seven verses. So divide forty-seven with seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Almost seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want to do like seven verses a day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, we can do seven verses a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-seven verses should be divided by seven. So daily seven verses, average, one class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One hour class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, you said three hours a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but that... It doesn't have to be spread out. This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One hour... To explain seven verses may take more than one hour. It will take not less than two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We want to have, in total, three hours of total yoga a day, including practice and class, like two hours in the morning, one hour in the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So practice two hours and one hour class. And the yoga class, they should be given the seat <span class="Italic">caila, jina, ajina, kuśottaram.</span> Seat. One straw... That... What is called? <span class="Italic">Kuśa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuśa</span> grass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuśa</span> grass. <span class="Italic">Kuśāsana,</span> very nice, nice, and broad, especially. Upon this, there is a deerskin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should get deerskin also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how you will get? Why you are asking this nonsense question? Unless you get, why you waste time in that way? Where is...? Have you got? This is extra question. You must get. So, first of all this <span class="Italic">kuśāsana,</span> then the deerskin and then a linen. <span class="Italic">Cailājina...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Caila, agna, ajina, sutaram,(?) kuśottaram.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuśottaram</span> means upon the <span class="Italic">kuśāsana</span> these, <span class="Italic">ajina,</span> <span class="Italic">caila, caila...</span> What is <span class="Italic">caila?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Caila, ajina,</span> soft cloth and deerskin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So <span class="Italic">kuśa,</span> deerskin, soft cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Cotton cloth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It should be of cotton.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āsana,</span> soft <span class="Italic">āsana.</span> First of all, this <span class="Italic">kuśāsana,</span> then the deerskin and then one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Soft cloth. This will be excellent because nobody else is teaching yoga this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So they will sit down and perpendicularly. Perpendicularly, if you sit in this way, then you will automatically you become perfect yogi. Automatically. This should be practiced. In every class they should sit down with like this, like this, and they will not close the eyes but half-closed and see here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Staring at the tip of the nose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They supposed to look cross-eyed? In order to look at the tip of the nose...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...you have to look cross-eyed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why cross? You see, just easy, simply. That's all. This...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can sit straight and also look.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This has to be practiced. And then they should be given lesson on six or seven verses very elaborately, and they will hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They should sit like this, and then they should hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they may want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one, first, seven <span class="Italic">śloka</span> they'll hear, then next class, they'll go to the next, in the next class, and next class, next class. In this way, one after another, within seven days they'll get the whole lesson.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if we want to have three hours total. Even in the class...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...they should be sitting like this, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So, in other words, the total three hours that they have to be like this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not total three hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then what will they do in the third hour?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, I was thinking that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no "I was thinking." This is nonsense. We must do according to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But can't we bring chanting of <span class="Italic">japa</span> into it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Mantra-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was my idea, that they should chant half an hour <span class="Italic">japa</span> before class, and then sit in the posture and then have the philosophy because the chanting... First of all explain the purpose of chanting to fix the mind; then, once they've chanted, then they can sit and listen, and because they've chanted, they'll be that much more attentive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's good idea. That's good idea. First chanting, second chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> First chant half an hour...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then lesson, take lesson. And then chant another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then, after that, some <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Japa</span> first, then class and then <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At last <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That would be like half an hour, an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the class will be changed-first seven verses explain. Next verse, next seven... In this way, today this room, next day that room, next day that room, next day that room. Room. That will be class, not in the same. Because if somebody is hearing the first seven <span class="Italic">ślokas,</span> then how the who are on the second seven <span class="Italic">ślokas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, your idea is the class will go simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So in this way we have to occupy seven rooms, big rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this means we have to have seven teachers also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what we have to do, we'll have to have courses starting every Monday. So suppose I come in on Saturday I have to wait till Monday for the course to start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because we do not have, realistically speaking, seven qualified teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? What is the qualification? They cannot read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, at least you need some intelligence. Like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if we are scarcity of such intelligent men, then close it. What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also you have to be a good speaker to keep people's attention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that will depend on practice. You practice it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because the people who come are very sophisticated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then why...? You become expert. If you cannot find out seven men, then what is this institution? Anyway, one may not be very expert, but he should practice how to explain. The explanation is there. He has to simply do it very nicely, that's all. Everything is there. And the students should sit down in that way here. That's all. It's not at all difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Usually the yoga camps begin on a certain date and finish on a certain date.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Usually the yoga camps advertise to begin lessons on a certain date and finish by a certain date.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is seven days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. But they don't stagger it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They don't stagger the course, yes. See, if he arranges with, say, like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Courses start every Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then they'll advertise that there's a course starting every Monday and finishing every Sunday, like that. And then they'll book in accordance so that they'll arrive on a Monday and they'll drive out on Sunday night or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. But what is the difficulty? He is... On Monday he is hearing in one room, and Tuesday another room, and Thursday another room. So where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also, this way we have to reserve seven rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this way, if we have courses Monday to Sunday, we can have one big hall, just keep one hall for yoga class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean you cannot give two kinds of classes in one room. That is not possible. That is nonsense. Even if you have got one student, he must be in that particular class. You cannot hold all the classes in one room, no, you have to... No, for seven days you have to give seven rooms, even there is one student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even if it is the same class... It's not going to be a different class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Different verses we shall explain. It is different class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We explain seven verses from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> on Monday. And the next seven verses will be in the next room, and those who are beginning, they will be in the first room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that's if you have two or three batches of tourists coming in at different times. But his idea was that all the tourists would come at one time and go through the course and then leave. And then a new batch would come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And if they came on Saturday for example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why don't you understand? Why you are dull-headed? The one class is for one set of verses. Where is the difficulty? [break] ...so in the same class, it will be not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we will not have a person in the next...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have or not have, you have to make this arrangement. In one room one set of verses you should explain. Otherwise, if some student comes, first set of verses explained, and he comes, so you cannot explain the same verses to somebody and next verses somebody in the same class. That is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Our program, therefore, to avoid this, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that our courses will start every Monday, end every Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your course will start every Monday? What do you mean by that? Through first... First six verses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Will be done on Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Next six verses, Tuesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On Tuesday. So like this, it will go on. So suppose I am a tourist, and I come to the guesthouse on Wednesday. So I will wait in the guesthouse till Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I will start my next class next Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is your dull brain. On Wednesday also, the first class is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, I understand what you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why he has to wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All seven classes have to go on simultaneously every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes! Yes. But you are so fertile brain you cannot understand. Why he has to wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's not expecting that so many people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every class is going on every day. Those who are coming new, they take first lesson in the first room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I follow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So either it is Wednesday or Monday, it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are three problems that I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> First problem is, we'll have to reserve seven rooms...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...and lose money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No lose money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There are rooms in the <span class="Italic">gurukula.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but that cannot be used for tourists at the moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why cannot be used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> room? They are not ready for use. The people who come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, it will be finished by the time your customers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Your tourist traffic is not going to come immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are the months now, December, January, February...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, it has to be done like that, that all classes are going on every day. One who comes on Wednesday, it does not mean he has to wait. The class is there. It doesn't matter Wednesday or Friday. Next day he goes there, next class, next day he goes, next class. The difficulty may be that we have to set aside seven rooms. That we have got, room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That we have in the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> building...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...but not at the moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> building is meant for instruction. And the guesthouse is meant for boarding and lodging. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we wanted to take advantage of it in a month or so, like the tourists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By month, it will be done. The <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> downstairs will be ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There must be some rooms suitable by a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If not, for the temporary you can hold somewhere. That doesn't matter. But the system will be this education will be given in the <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Now, we're also going to do this in Bombay, Śrīla Prabhupāda because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But first of all, you make one successful here. Then you think of other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now we should not teach them any exercise at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is exercise. If he sits down two hours like that, it is more than exercise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this may not satisfy them. They may want to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not going to satisfy them. This is our... This is our process. If you want to learn, then we have to learn according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We are not going to flatter you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If we explain that the whole purpose of the exercises...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the explanation required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is to concentrate, and by concentration your health will improve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The idea is to tone the body so the senses are subdued.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So we engage their senses in <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the actual fact. You read that portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They are coming to India to learn yoga, right? What is the perfection of yoga? Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot dictate. That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they want exercise, we can stand them up, arms in the air, they can dance and they can chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll make the <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> so ecstatic that they are jumping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he can dance. He can dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then they jump and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dance and chant. This is best exercise. We allow them to dance very... Yes. High jump. Actually that is exercise and, at the same time ecstasy. If they dance and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, it is automatically a very big exercise and spiritual advancement. Yes. Yes. There is no doubt about it. If he chants and dances, immediately he become ecstatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Breathing is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of course, that why... It depends on the teacher. If the teacher is a very good speaker and preacher, he can, right in the introduction, point out how this yoga is different from the other yogas which are bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't say it is different. It is the authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no need to mention anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is authorized, and it is taught by Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Others are unauthorized. This is authorized. And that's a fact. This is authorized. And others, those, they are manufactured. Just like they have manufa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is authorized in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In every... <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...</span> This is Vedic. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> means the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And which other way can be authorized way? You have to impress that upon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Another one hour...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting, dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They haven't got to attend other classes. Let them chant and dance, <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> other one hour. Because here is the class. They'll simply sit down in that yogic posture and hear. That's all. You explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These people are... I understand this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, they have a misconception what yoga is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know, I know. But if we want to get repeat business...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, we are not after business. This is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Our program is the most attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When they go to these yoga classes; they don't get anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not going to flatter them. If you want to learn, you have to learn according to the authorized way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The appeal of these other groups is sex. We're not interested in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No I'm not saying sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, it is. That's how they're appealing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Their whole platform is bogus then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all bogus. Bogus. We are not going to follow the bogus. At least in these seven days they must not have any sex. Then he will be all right. They'll get some benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's described here also. That will come out automatically in the class, that one has to sit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will have to take thrice bath and eat frugally, not voraciously. If they want real treatment, that will benefit them. If they have got some ideas of yoga and we have to cheat them, that is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Why should we have to cheat them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They want to be cheated but we cannot cheat. For getting some customer you have to flatter them-that is not possible. And while explaining the <span class="Italic">ślokas,</span> you have to stress on this point, that this is bona fide; all others are cheating. That requires on your preaching power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually I was reading through your purports in this chapter the other day, and everything, every aspect, is completely explained in the purports. If one carefully reads this chapter then there's no problem. You just preach whatever is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we could do is... I mean you may not like this... Publish a small booklet just based on the Sixth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just publish the Sixth Chapter, that this is our booklet on yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can make a booklet, the Sixth Chapter explained, and posture, how to sit. That sitting down, that will attract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because they want to see these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That sitting posture will attract them. Give them figure, "This is the posture of sitting," and they will hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we can do, have a small booklet on yoga...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Concentrate on <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-mūrti</span> here, in the heart, and hear... This will immediately give some effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or... Yes. We can have some pictures of people. And we'll publish your Sixth Chapter, like, just like publishing Sixth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> with a two-page introduction how this yoga is different from others and this is a guide, the Sixth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the most ancient Hindu scripture, Indian scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So keep some price for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That will be like a separate book, five rupees, with some illustrations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And then like we can have some... People are very much into beads...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we'll have some neckbeads they'll take with a small statue, Deity, pendant of Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then there is one artist. He has come to paint pictures. Explain. He will give you. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Oh, yes, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And plus he can do that for the new brochure also. We can have like a necklace with a pendant of Viṣṇu, four-handed, to meditate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have a proper shelf there which will supply <span class="Italic">hari-nāma cādara,</span> beads, beadbag, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes. Take this idea. Note down. First of all make this brochure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That brochure which I made on Vṛndāvana, just one page, I'm taking up, Vṛndāvana and other temple pictures, and putting in a section on yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So see how you have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If we don't have our own shop there which sells everything, then they'll just go down Loi Bazaar and buy it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have our own shop and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we are having our own shop now in the <span class="Italic">gurukula.</span> We are having it before the festival. We are having that before the festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It should be open for this course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another thing, that... I don't think they are very serious, that... They have paid that 250 rupees rate? This bank? They wrote they are going to pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Last I heard when I left is they had got their approval to pay two hundred rupees, but they haven't paid so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have written 250.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They wrote 250? Viśvambhara told me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I saw that letter, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> 250.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually that room is a very good room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that letter? Bank's letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From Gupta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Gupta, bank letter, Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which Gupta? The accountant of Punjab National...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have replied that letter on the other day. You do not know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did you want us to use that room? The room in which the bank is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh yes. You mean about the rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, he said 250.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Find out that letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a reply to it too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He says there's going to be women coming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is no instruction. For women there is no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No women on the course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No women?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is bogus, another bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's bogus. But we have a lot of women who are coming to India for yoga. Half... The traffic is half men, half women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Women cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And a lot of the tourists who come, they are husband, wife and all together. Why don't we let them wear normal dress but have men and women in the same class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We could... It's just a suggestion, but what about if you have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Normal dress, that is standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or yoga pants. They can have pajamas and <span class="Italic">kurtās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A separate woman's class? But that means, yes. That means you have to have women teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are artificial things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mixed class, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For woman there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I think we should avoid women altogether. Avoid women altogether?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Women, it is only possible in our Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga-</span>women and men can be given equal right. There is no other system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can wear a normal dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they wear those big robes... Sometimes I see... It's a one-piece thing. It comes down to their ankles. If they wear something like that, it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because they want to do something different. They want to see different things. If we give them a pajama and <span class="Italic">kurtā,</span> we'll still make them do <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> but it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga,</span> chanting, dancing there will be. They can join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they cannot practice. They cannot sit down like this, the women. They'll be tired. This is real practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think even the men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogāsana. Yogāsana, dhyāna, dhāraṇā, āsana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's so then we can show them, "See this yoga is...," because it appears a little difficult, it is the best form of yoga. It's not something easy that you can just do in one second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So what's the conclusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will sit together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So he says... He thinks the conclusion is that the women will be in the class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There, but in plain dress. Yes, man must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Plain dress or if they wear dresses, they can have pant-<span class="Italic">kurtā</span> pajamas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why pant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can wear a long robe. That's better, like one of those complete robes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, long robe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rajneesh people wear them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">nāmāvali</span> robe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, very good idea. We can make Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Out of a <span class="Italic">nāmāvali,</span> yeah. <span class="Italic">Nāma cādara. Hari-nāma cādara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can have some robe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, we can have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...some covering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, this will be very good. This will really make us look different from others. We're giving <span class="Italic">kuśa</span> grass, linen, and robe, beads...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they will understand that they are actually doing something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And they will see, because these <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they look for these tangible differences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least twice taking bath and then chanting, dancing and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. They're coming for some... Just to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They want something. So this is the bona fide method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Are you having tours where they'll go to Rādhā-kuṇḍa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That is during the rest of the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a very nice thing about this program, is that you can guarantee everyone who comes is going to be interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have given to you three. Now you jointly do immediately. The artist is there. Get painting. That's... That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
