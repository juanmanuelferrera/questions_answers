<div class="Normal-Level">(Śrīla Prabhupāda is taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> during first part of the conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and we don't smoke even. We don't spend a <span class="Italic">paisa</span> even for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They're squandering billions of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they, you spend money for cigarette, for cinema, for restaurant, unnecessarily. We don't spend a farthing even, for all this purpose. Simply we take little rice, <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi,</span> that's all. And still, you are culprit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They, in the papers report that, that we spend very lavishly for the Deities, but for ourselves we eat only very simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is it not credit? We spend for God. We are servant of God. We want to see God gorgeously situated, and for us we have no comforts, we don't care for any comfort. We simply spend minimum just to keep the body and soul together, that's all. This is our principle. We don't spend a farthing for our sense gratification. This should be noted down if some case is there, this should be presented. We don't go to restaurant, we don't go to cinema, we don't spend lavishly for dress or something else, no. Neither for furniture (laughter). Eh? If you sit down in a, a pad is that faulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then when they go to any of our temples, they're amazed because we don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We sit down, don't use any chair, any couches, unnecessarily, carpet. What expenditure? We have no expenditure for personal self. And still you are faulty? What can be done? We don't purchase any cosmetic, this clay <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> is sufficient. We don't apply any pomade or cosmetic or ointment. Either for our girls or ourselves. We don't do that, we live very simply. After 15 days we shave, there is no use of cutting or decorating. Note down all these things. We have no doctor's bill even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's because of those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least I save doctors bill, (chuckles) I am always sick, but I never go to the doctor. Give me little <span class="Italic">nim</span>, give me little this (sounds of hand striking table), that's all. Then what less expenditure we can make? As far as possible we do not go even to the doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, It's because of these things, that they're wondering well then, what do we do with the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We spend for Kṛṣṇa. Just like spending it, <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees in Bombay for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We just have to show them how many books we are printing and everything, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's not that we're letting the money sit and accumulating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I am daily canvassing Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, "Print book! I don't want to keep the money in the bank, convert into the books and keep it in our..." I am asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever little money I've got, I don't want to keep in the bank. I want to convert it and purchase paper, print book. Then these rascals will never be able to take anything from us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am asking every time. Ask Gopāla that, "Print books and keep it nicely, otherwise somebody may steal and sell in the market." Our books should be printed and kept very safely. This is our program. And they are speaking from the Vedic literature. We don't manufacture any magic, any jugglery, any mystic power. We have no mystic power. So, which point they will find fault? (laughs) I don't think we have got any loophole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We simply have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...present our whole program and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our only business is how to establish Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the only business. Our quarrel with our men: Why this temple is not clean? Why there is no flower in the Deity room? This is our fight. We have no other cause of fight. And why should we show magic? But these inquiries are going on-it is good-these rascals will be exposed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm. The people are so confused because they don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What's bona fide and what is not now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither they want. They are becoming skeptic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody's bona fide, that's all. This is their conclusion. Because they have confronted with some non-bona fide, they have concluded that everyone is non-bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very easy just to try to brush it all under the couch and forget about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) A man's household utensils was taken by the thief. He promised, "I shall not purchase anymore utensils, I shall eat on the floor. (laughs) Because the thief has stolen my plates, I'm not going to purchase anymore, I shall eat on the floor. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They give the example that just because someone may be passing counterfeit money, that doesn't mean that all the money you get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. They conclude that no more take any money, all counterfeit. At least in India, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is there, accepted, the God-science literature all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every country. So why they do not take the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as the standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Eventually they will if we push it on. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My mother was very much fond of pickles. After resting in the afternoon, she would take something very sour, pickle. We used to take with her also. (laughs) We were small children, my mother died when I was only 14 years old. (long pause) (aside) What else? All right bring it. (sounds of plates sliding)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Potato <span class="Italic">pakorā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, hm. [break] ...just in front of our house, attached to our house. That means the house belonged to one of our relatives and her son, stepson, he sold the whole house to a Marwari without the knowledge of this, my, she was in relation grandmother. So when the house was sold in those days, about say about 100 years ago, not 100 years, about 90 years. In Mahatma Gandhi road, most important, that Mullik's house you have seen? That was one of the Mullik's house, for 12,000 rupees. One <span class="Italic">bighā</span> of land and grand building. So it was unknown to the stepmother, the stepson sold it. Then she appealed to the high-court that, "I belong to a respectable family and this my spoiled stepson has sold the house without my knowledge, then where shall I go?" The high-court considered that, "The drunkard son has sold at a cheap price, and she's belongs to a respectable family, where she'll go?" And the high-court order was, "The half of the house shall be used by this lady. During her lifetime, you cannot take possession," the Marwari who purchased. So under that grandmother, we used to live. Therefore this half portion of the house was a Marwari school. So it is just like our temple and this. So my father first admitted me in that Marwari school. So I learned this <span class="Italic">devanāgarī </span>there, for a few days I was going. I was the only Bengali student there. Because I was little, my father thought that instead of going outside the house, within the house there is a school, get him admitted. The school name was Visuddhana(?) Marwari Vijnala(?), something like that, and later on they constructed huge building Visuddhana(?). Then the house was vacated. So in the beginning I was admitted in a Marwari school and I learned a little Hindi there, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That was little chance also, understanding Hindi. And I was maybe 7, 6 or 7 years old, that's all. Then somebody made at Saranpur. That was of course not in the school. Then in our college there were many up-country (?) class friends, Scottish Churches College. One of them was that Grnanatha (?), he came here, (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was bigger (?) in the police court M.A., B.A... Now, I repeatedly told him that "You stay here and write Hindi."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He didn't stay here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He stayed for one week or 15 days. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> L-A-R-Y-N-X. Cavity with enclosing muscles and mucus membrane behind and communicating with nose, mouth and larynx.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Here this side, this space some connection, when it is affected that is called laryngitis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know some of the medical terms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now this disease is called laryngitis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Śarīraṁ vyādhi-mandiram. </span>It is a temple of disease. The temple of di..., temple of miseries. Not only disease, there are so many other things. Huh? <span class="Italic">Mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 2.14]<span class="Italic">,</span> simply giving trouble. <span class="Italic">Śarīra-bandha, asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">. Deha, deha</span> means <span class="Italic">kleśada, kleśada</span> troublesome. They do not know this science. And they do not know how to get out of this body, there is no science. This is the only science Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They do not know this science, they do not know what is the real position, how troubles come, how we are suffering. Nothing of the sort. And our Kṛṣṇa Consciousness movement is simply dealing with this, how to get out of this entanglement of the body. That is the only problem. And the materialistic person, they do not think it as a problem. <span class="Italic">Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati [Bg.<b class="calibre4"> </b></span>15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are dealing with the real problems, and others they do not know what is the problems, what to speak of dealing with them. Completely in ignorance, how the body is changing, why there are different forms of life, wherefrom they are coming. They do not deal with these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everybody thinks their body is for enjoying this. They think it's the source of pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That enjoyment that God's children? They also thought it is enjoyment, you see? The hippies are thinking, enjoying. And others little polished way. They are also the same, in a polished way, by dressing nicely. Eh? Everyone is in ignorance, <span class="Italic">tribhir guṇamayair bhāvaiḥ.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Ebhiḥ sarvam idaṁ jagat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair ebhiḥ sarvam idaṁ jagat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is from the 7th chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventh, yes. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> See if it's 7, fifteenth or fourteenth. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**, sleeping, and eating, and sense enjoyment conquered. So no sleeping, no eating and no sense gratification, that is perfection. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau cātyanta-dīnau. </span>Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"Deluded by the three modes (goodness, passion, and ignorance), the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is the disease, material disease. They are being carried away by the three modes of material nature. Hm? It is explained further that <span class="Italic">puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi bhuṅkte...</span> [Bg. 13.22]. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Guṇān. Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya, sad-asad-yoni...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu.</span> Hm? <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi</span> [Bg. 13.22]<span class="Italic">. </span>So, this is a big purport about this? How big...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> About one page. <span class="Italic">Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvaiḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Read it.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature. Those who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. In this material world everyone is under the influence of these three <span class="Italic">guṇas </span>and is thus bewildered.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">By nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of psychic and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas. </span>Those who are purely in the mode of passion are called <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas. </span>Those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called <span class="Italic">vaiśyas. </span>Those who are completely in ignorance are called <span class="Italic">śūdras. </span>And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However, these designations are not permanent. I may either be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya </span>or whatever-in any case, this life is temporary. But although life is temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by the spell of this illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this bodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian, Russian or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, </span>Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is behind all these modes. So Lord Kṛṣṇa says that men, deluded by these three modes of nature, do not understand that behind the material background is the Supreme Godhead.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are many different kinds of living entities-human beings, demigods, animals, etc.-and each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance? Kṛṣṇa consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are truly established in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are actually liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is explanation of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think in any other edition such explanation is there. Dr. Radhakrishnan, other this Dada (?) Krishna. Radhakrishnan and Dada Krishna. <span class="Italic">Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair ebhiḥ sarvam.</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> Therefore they cannot understand what is God, especially the communist countries. Completely in ignorance. (Sanskrit) They're thinking that by external adjustment, by following the Marxist theory or Lenin's theory and killing the capitalists, inventing some bogus ways of happiness... (pause) You have been in Moscow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hm, several times.</div>

His room is very small, maybe two times the size of your kitchen and whole family was living in that. Mother, grandmother, father, him, and when Mandākinī went there she was also living there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I was asking this boy, that was here a few days ago from South India, from Kerala, he was in Russia. I asked him. "What did you eat there?" What did you, you stayed for one year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He must be eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, he said, "I was able to get frozen vegetables from the south of Russia. They freeze it and then they sell it," he said, "but it is very expensive, very costly." He was getting frozen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also nasty. Frozen means nasty. I never take frozen. In the beginning I thought, "Oh, it is very nice, you can get fresh vegetable." But they are not at all fresh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All rotten, rather the same vegetable, as we have got in India practice, we dry it and keep it. That is tasteful. In season time-suppose this season there is huge quantity of vegetable-so here the system is they cut into pieces during the season and dry it in the sun and keep it. And during out of season it is soaked in water, it revives the old taste, then you can cook. (Hindi or Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Tastes as though it is different. The fresh vegetable the taste is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fresh vegetable must be, but still there is some taste. But this frozen it has no taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Even they have, Indians those who are fish eaters, they keep this dry fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, dried fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They-fresh fish-they smear with turmeric and salt and keep it in the sunshine and they dry it. And of course this fish it has no, what is it taste. (laughter) But they keep it. (aside) Bring me little water. (Bengali and Hindi) This I want to introduce, let them be satisfied whatever they can produce themselves locally. What is that, little cloth, little food? Any man can produce these things. There is no difficulty at all. They must agree to this simple life. Otherwise, everywhere you can produce your own food and cloth and cottage. If possible you can construct big buildings. There is no need. And they should be satisfied, happy with Kṛṣṇa. Then life is successful. This I want to introduce now, anywhere. And it is practical. It is not something bogus. It is... We have already experimented. By God's grace we can produce everything from the lands, <span class="Italic">sarva-kāma-dughā mahī, sarva-kāma-dughā mahī?</span> You can get everything. If they are satisfied with this simple life, then they save time for Kṛṣṇa consciousness and happy life. In India they don't require even cottage. One <span class="Italic">katiya</span> (?) is sufficient. Keeping in one place and lay down. Eight months, at least six months, it is very nice. At night, even in daytime it is very hot, at night it is cool. So you have got very good sleep, soothing, then you become refreshed in the morning. If you have got good sleep at night, then you become refreshed, your health is regained. Hm? If I (indistinct), take morning <span class="Italic">snāna</span> and <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span> During very hot season they don't take even <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span> They take some fruits, guava and this... What is called that? (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That? Melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Melon, yes. During hot season you get watermelon, this other melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Honeydew melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Honeydew melon, oh very nice. In the upcountries still in the village during daytime they don't eat. During daytime they take some fruits and at night when it is cool, the cool ah, refreshing air, they make some <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span> One time, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh, (Hindi) In that night because in daytime it is so hot, it is embarrassing to cook and to digest also. Better take food, ah, fruit, this melon, and at night they take 3 or 4 <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> according to the... And good sleep. Very happy life it was, all over India. There was no question of poverty. People did not know what is poverty and now it is poverty. They do not get even sufficient food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Industrialization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ugra-karma.</span> I don't like industrialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>November 3, 1976, Vṛndāvana</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...brainwash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But how can they take it that what we're doing is a bad thing. If we're training people how to avoid intoxication, how to avoid illicit sex, abortion, contraception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, "Why you should avoid? This is life. Why you are brainwashing?" One boy was there in the beginning. What was his name? Ranchor, his name, I gave him. So his father argued, "Why you are avoiding illicit sex? This is life! Why you are afraid? I'll give you car. I'll give you girls. You enjoy. What is this philosophy, nonsense philosophy." His father was arguing. I think everyone's father argues like that. Lord Roland said, he said, "Why you are prohibiting this thing? This is our life. It is impossible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing is in society still, even now, there are people who abstain from it. There are vegetarians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There may be very few, one or two. That is insignificant. One million, two person, he is. At least especially in your country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing is that they don't claim that they are brainwashed. So we're a society where we're doing all these things, combinedly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." If the majority are fools and rascal, if you say something sane, then they'll ask... The man, the sane man, he is insane. He's crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then how to fight them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the position. The only means is that in spite of all opposition we have to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will cleanse. Otherwise there is no other way. Argument and logic, they have no brain to understand. It requires this transcendental method, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. You have to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and let them give the chance to hear. Then they will be able to catch it, what we are saying, not directly. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then how are we going to fare in this court case? 'Cause in these court cases it's a question of presenting one side against the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, philosophy is there. Court case means there is philosophy, there is logic. So for that we have got so many books. We can... But general mass of people, chanting. When there is court case we are prepared to defend. We have got... We are not fools. We can talk that what is the aim of life. They cannot say anything. The transmigration of the soul, the aim of life which we are discussing in our book, that's fact. How he can deny the transmigration of the soul from one body to another? And if that is accepted, the whole problem is solved. He does not know what kind of life he is going to get. Therefore they do not accept this philosophy. If once accepted, then next question-"What kind of life we are going to get, either to become a tree or a dog or human being?" What arrangement you have done that you will get next life human being? Then the pious and impious activities comes one after another. The basic principle they are denying. "After this body is finished, everything is finished." <span class="Italic">Bhāsmi bhūtasya dehasya punar agama...(?)</span> "The body will be burned into ashes, and where is life? Who is coming? Who is going? That's all." They do not see the soul. Their medical science cannot find out where is soul. How do they say the... The soul means intelligence, they say. Otherwise how do they say the animal has no soul? Why do they say? What is the... "Man has soul," they say. "The animal has no soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's what the Christians say. The Christians say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the symptom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they... 'Cause he, man, has reason and logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means reason and logic is soul. That is their idea. That is not soul. Intelligence, when I say, "You have got intelligence," it does not mean you are intelligence. "You have got intelligence," we say like that. We never say, "You are intelligence." So intelligence is not soul. The rascals, they do not know. Mistake. Nobody says, "You are intelligence." They say, "You are intelligent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Intelligence is something you possess.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Brainwashing: clearing the mind of established ideas by persistent suggestion and indoctrination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) That is... We are doing that. They are under the impression, "Work hard, earn money, and enjoy life." We say, "No. Don't work hard for sense gratification but work hard for self-realization." Indoctrine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, any form of education is indoctrination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indoctrinization. Yes. Any kind of education is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Whatever you teach someone, you teach according to whatever you see as the correct value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The child goes to the school. His brain is packed up: "I shall play all day." He likes to play but it is indoctrinization that "No, you should read. You must become graduate."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. And whatever country he's born in, he has to learn the culture of that country, he's indoctrinated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from that, education is required. The child wants to play but we have to educate him that "No, play is not all. You have to be educated." Similarly, this animal life, eating, sleeping, mating, this is already there. No. We say, "Not only this, you have to realize God." This kind of brainwash is required. If we do not understand God, then what is the difference between you and dog? He knows how to eat, how to sleep. He doesn't require any high education how to eat. Everyone knows how to eat, how to use sex. Nobody requires any university education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Simply ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the animal enjoy sex, they know which part of the body has to be used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They don't have to be taught.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no need of education. He knows it. And these rascals, they are presenting Freud's philosophy, sex. Just see how they are wasting time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have so many books now on so-called sex education, so many of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply wasting time. There is a story about this. One man was canvassing, hawking. Hawker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, hawker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he was, "Here is a book of cow protection, cow protection." He has written one book to take care of the cows. So one old man called him, "What you are selling?" Now, "I am selling this book." "What is that book?" "Maintaining the cow." So, "Why you are selling? First of all give this book to your mother because you are no better than cow, so she will learn how to give you protection." That means he wanted to impress upon him that "Cow protection doesn't require any education. You have written a book? So you are such a rascal, cow intelligence. Better give this book to your mother. She will maintain you. Don't sell it. Everyone knows how to give cow protection." So similarly, this sex literature, there is no need of sex literature. Sex literature is there in Sanskrit also. That is how to restrict sex. For what purpose one should indulge in sex, that is called <span class="Italic">Kāma-śāstra.</span> I have seen this Freud philosophy became so prominent that sometimes in the year... 1940's maybe. So one young woman was traveling, and another young man was traveling. So they began to discuss about sex very openly. And both of them unknown. Still, they engaged themselves in discussing the sex literature, without any shame.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pseudo-intellectuals. Shameless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Young boy, young girl, they began to discuss on sex openly as scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What is this scientific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientific means after discussing for some time you propose that "Let us enjoy sex." That's all. It is common thing in your country, unknown girl, unknown boy, and talk for some time, "Let us go to some restaurant," and then talk more intimately, and then sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the whole social system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Would you like to sex?" And who is the young man, young... They'll deny it. I know this. During ball dance they embrace one another, another's wife, another husband, and in ball dance... Or there are side rooms. Naturally they'll feel sex and they go to the side room and discuss. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The only reason they go to a dance is to pick up some woman for sex life. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Most of my friends used to go out specifically to find some woman to have sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This dancing club means this. (end)</div>
