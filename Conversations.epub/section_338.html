<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that the energy is displayed. It works; again it comes back to the original. That's all. So what is their idea of conservation of energy? The same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say that there is no original. It never began, so there's no original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They also say that there's no resting place. They say that energy has no resting place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is absurd because we see the energy is coming from the powerhouse, electric energy. How you cannot deny?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The energy is just generated there, but it is not created there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generated, you simply change the name. What is the difference between generated and created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, created means to be born or to start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, born. The child is created. There was no child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But the energy which makes up this body was always present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we also say, by the formation, when it takes place, it is created. Just like you prepare food. Why do you say, "prepare"? What is the meaning of "prepare"? The ingredients are there, but why do you say, "prepare food"? You cannot say... Huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Before you prepare it, that particular preparation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we say. The energy was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That is just a conventional term in relationship to you. That is just relative to you, relative to your relationship with that food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is called impersonalism...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But the food was always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that... We talk in relationship, everything, because this is relative world. Everything we talk, that is in relative consideration. That is <span class="Italic">Māyāvāda</span> philosophy. They do not accept the relativity. Although when there is some toothache, he will go to the doctor. Why does he not..., "No, it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Why I shall be troubled with the toothache?" Why does he go to the doctor? That is the defect of <span class="Italic">Māyāvāda</span> philosophy. They are being affected by the change, but still, they will say, "There is no change. It is all the same."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that is what they say. They say, "If it is all the same, then I can go to the doctor."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but that is foolishness. If they say once that "The suffering and not suffering is all the same," why does he go to the doctor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, when you say, "It's all the same," it doesn't matter what you do. You have encompassed everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> But they always go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That doesn't matter. If they don't go or do go, it's all the same. It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it doesn't matter... If I beat you with shoes, it doesn't matter? Why do you become angry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, it doesn't matter that I become angry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) So let me beat you. You don't become angry or become angry, I don't care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say, "That's going on anyway."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then there is no question of philosophy. Finish. Everything one. That... This philosophy was discussed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His mother. He was eating dirt, and mother gave Him <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span> So He did not care to take <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span> He was eating dirt. Then mother came, "My dear boy, why you are eating dirt? Here is <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span> I have given you." "Mother, what is the difference between <span class="Italic">sandeśa</span> and dirt? They are all the same. (laughing) They are all the same." "Yes, my dear boy, You are impersonalist philosopher. But it is required. Just like the water jug is also earth, made of earth. It is earth. And this ground is also earth. But when you have to keep water you require this water jug, not this earth." That is relativity. If you have to take work, then you cannot say, "Well, this is also earth, this is also... Why...? The pot is not required. Put water here." Then you will suffer, no water. So this kind of philosophy was discussed when Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a child. [break] ...and the tree is the same thing. But when I walk, I require the stick, not this tree. [break] ...The dogs must be on lash (leash). If somebody does not do that, he is criminal. So if he pleads in the court, "There is no difference, dogs on the lash or without lash. Why you are punishing me?" But will that be accepted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, the judge says, "There is no difference whether I put you in jail or not."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That's it. Then he has to accept jail. He should not defend himself. "Never mind. I go to jail." Why he appoints a lawyer to defend himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that's what the impersonalist philosophers say, that "Go ahead and..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...The most famous theologian of this century named Paul Tillich said that all words are symbols, and God is a religious symbol pointing to our ultimate concern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. We say also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Except Paul Tillich was the ultimate rascal. He was a debaucher. He debauched women all over Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He recently died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> There is a book about him, a very inflammatory book about how he would debauch all of his friends. He said he got all of his inspirations after having sex with other women. He said after having sex he would get his inspirations on theology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes the drunkards say also like that. They get inspiration by drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> There is one very famous philosopher named Dubrown(?). He said that he had a saying that "Some men say that you become intoxicated by wine, but I become sobered by wine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be accepted. "One man's food, another man's poison." That is going on everywhere. But for that reason one cannot accept poison as food. Is it not? Just like stool is food for the pigs. But that does not mean stool is food. It may be food for a certain class of animals. [break] No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Food for somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It is very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Harder than a bullet? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have not covered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> That's all right. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, so they are coming to consciousness. Why they are praying to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Things get so bad, they have to turn to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Duḥkhe sab hari bhaje.</span> When one is distressed, there is sense of God consciousness, but if they continue it even in their happiness, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They must have knowledge though, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in happiness they forget. (aside:) Don't keep so near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Without knowledge their sentiment is just worthless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's a fact. In American history, whenever there was economic prosperity, always increase in sense gratification. Historically speaking, in America, whenever there was increase in prosperity, there was a trend towards irreligion and sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere. Luxury leads to poverty. [break] ...a living man, but if you are actually interested, why don't you do it, organized way. Sentiment, it is good, but if you do not understand the science, sentiment may be for the time being. Sentiment is sentiment. That will not act. They are admitting sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes, they are admitting that... They are an abyss of moral decay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them know what are the sinful activities. These are the sinful activities. Close all the slaughterhouses. Close all these illicit sex brothel houses, and close the liquor houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The gambling also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. Then their business will be finished. Then they will say, "Where we stand? It is all finished." Now you stand on a different platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in class, you mentioned how the churches, people could pay them for supposedly becoming very religious men. In Las Vegas, the capital of the gambling and the illicit sex and the intoxication, where all these things are very prominent, the churches there are very prominent also. These big demons, they pay large money to the churches and therefore they feel like they are very religious men even though they are committing all these sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And by taking their sinful money, because they do not engage to Kṛṣṇa, they also become sinful. Affection. Infection. [break] They have mentioned something like sinful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes, sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he has said, Karandhara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> He doesn't say specifically. He just said that generally the country is degraded and people have become apathetic, and the morals have reduced. He was referring to things like Watergate, political scandals, and the youth degradation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why they have degraded? That is to be understood... Not known to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Actually they don't have the scientific analysis. They just have some vague understanding that things are falling apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here are the causes. Sinful life. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...the affair, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Oh, then the country could be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I am already in charge, but who is following me? (laughter) That is the difficulty. [break] ...one who is to be followed, that is called <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> So who is following the <span class="Italic">ācārya?</span> Nobody is following. <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> is there, but nobody is following <span class="Italic">ācārya. Ācaraṇa. Ācaraṇa</span> means behavior. <span class="Italic">Ācārya.</span> "This man is ideal. One should follow him." That is called <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> [break] ...to allow us one day to have chanting and speaking something about God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And I will go. I will speak and have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> [break] ...date.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> April 30th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> April 30th. So on that date arrange a meeting of the senators. And I will go and speak and have <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> what is actually life. Approach them that "We are spreading this. So why not arrange meeting?" Or any day, on 30th or any day. [break] ...office here in Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The local senator does. For this area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So see him. You and you go and arrange, and explain to him that "This is our movement, simply how to make people pure, moral, sinless, and advanced in God consciousness." Just take this opportunity. "You come and see how God consciousness we are executing, and then arrange a meeting in the Senate. And try to understand, 'It is simply sentiment or how it will help me?' " [break] ...so much money, and still they are crying, "Degradation." So they should come to their senses. This kind of understanding will not help. They must understand scientifically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Everybody is saying, not only politicians, but everybody is saying that we are degrading. Moral standard is degrading. But nobody acts. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is our duty to help them. Those who are... Just like here is an opportunity. Go, see them immediately, the person. It is our duty. [break] Sometime I can go and see. Who is the senator, local?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out and arrange some meeting. I shall go personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How many senators here in California?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Two per state. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As we know about God, nobody knows in the world. That is a fact. Any person we can challenge that he has no clear idea, what is God, how to contact God, how to... Nobody knows. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...a vague notion that they should be serving God, but they do not know how or what will please God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vague notion must be there because we have got relationship with God, eternal. So that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Nitya-siddha.</span> It is eternally a fact that we are servant of God, but we have forgotten this. So that has to be revived by this <span class="Italic">śravaṇa-kīrtana,</span> by hearing, chanting. This is the process. Otherwise, the relationship is already there. It is not to be created. It is already there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> An article appeared about the Vedānta Society here, and they mentioned us to say that we are not them. They said that "Those Hare Kṛṣṇas, they are fundamentalists." Just like there are fundamentalist Christians, we are fundamentalist followers of Kṛṣṇa. So it is very nice actually because it is fundamental to believe everything that Kṛṣṇa says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is the Vedānta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Speculation. They are speculators. They mostly have very elderly members, and they sit around in the evening and discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A few. Not even a dozen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In their <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> they say they have eight or ten people living there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No young men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, all old ladies and men. The only reason they are allowed to live there is because they have given huge sums as donations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...last almost one hundred years, eighty, eighty-five years. So how many followers they have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They have made no significant impression on anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. [break] Ramakrishna is God. Kālī is God. And they offer <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> what is that? Chicken...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Chicken, turkey, even meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Trivikrama Svāmī went to their monastery in Laguna Beach. So they were serving meat. Trivikrama said, "Why do you eat meat?" And they said, "That doesn't matter. What does it matter what you eat ?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you eat stool? This question was raised by Mālatī. One man said like that. She said, "Why don't you eat stool? Why you discriminate?" [break] Ramakrishna Mission has done the greatest harm to the Vedic culture. [break] ...said, "Why you are afraid of God?" He said like that. "Why you are afraid of God?" One Christian padre, priest, he said, "You are coming from India? How you are speaking like this?" He was astonished. But this rascal spoke like that. "Why do you believe that you are sinners? There is no sin." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The greatest sin is to think of ourselves as sinners. [break] Yogananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Because he was a rascal number one sinner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is just like Śrīla Prabhupāda's example that the rabbits closing their eyes thinking that the danger is over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Shivananda, I gave a lecture at an <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> where his disciple was teaching, Vishnu Devananda. So he told a story how Shivananda, he would find out the lowest class of people, and he would go and garland them and worship them just like the Deity. And so his argument was that in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says, <span class="Italic">paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he is to the lower class? <span class="Italic">Sama-darśinaḥ</span> means he is equal to higher or lower. Why he is going to the lower? He could not answer this? <span class="Italic">Sama-darśinaḥ,</span> equal. Then he must be equal to the lower and the higher. So why he is particularly to the lower class? Then he is not <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Then his argument would be that he is trying to teach a lesson that the higher...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. He may say nonsense. The fact is this. That if he is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ,</span> equal, then why he is particularly aiming to the lower class? That means he is not <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span> He has not come to the stage. He is simply talking nonsense. <span class="Italic">Sama-darśinaḥ</span> means he is equal to everyone. That is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ. Sama-darśinaḥ</span> does not mean to get a cheap adoration, popularity, I go to the poor. That is their Ramakrishna Mission. They also are doing that same thing. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā,</span> like that. Why <span class="Italic">daridra?</span> Why not real Nārāyaṇa? Just like this morning we read <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇa-pade.</span> Never said <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-pade.</span> To the great. Surrender does not mean to the lower. Does it mean surrender? Surrender, this relationship means that to whom I surrender, he is greater than me. And to the lower, mercy. These two words. One who is lower than me, I may show my mercy, but one who is greater than me, there is the question of surr... [break] (end)</div>
