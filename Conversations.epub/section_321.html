<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the scientific question? <span class="Italic">Muḍhāḥ. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When they say about the, how one starts talking about the origin of life, they say that one should first of all consider how the earth was formed, how this planet earth where we live, how it was formed, what is the origin of the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Earth. Origin of earth is life. It is very simple to understand. Just like your body. Your body is... Or why your body? Take the tree. Tree is matter, it is earth. Wherefrom the big tree comes? From the life within the seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they say that about 4.5 billion years ago this earth condensed in such a form, but before that there was no living entity because this earth was not suitable for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascal. No, no. You have got history for billions of years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that history? We have got history that Brahmā was the first creation, and from Brahmā... Brahmā created this universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are saying that before, it was all gaseous dust particles and some gaseous materials which were floating and in due course it condensed and then it formed this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So wherefrom the gas came? That they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah, they say it was just floating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Floating where. Wherefrom the sky came? They are all nonsense. Simply speculating and consuming cheap money from the government. That's all. This is their business. The government is exacting taxes from the hard-working men, and these rascals are devouring this money. That's all. And making theories. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> There was one big scandal where they found out all the scientists were just taking money. Even by material standards it was unnecessary. It was a very big scandal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It must be they are scandals. They are after money. That's all. Not after knowledge. And what knowledge they have got? Simply speculating and befooling other fools. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is their business. One blind man is befooling other blind men. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are very much convinced that this earth was gaseous. So there was no life at the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be. That may be that. But wherefrom the gas came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It was just existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhinnā prakṛtiḥ.</span> The answer is given. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhiḥ [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">. Vāyu, vāyu</span> gas, it came from Kṛṣṇa. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Vāyu. Vāyu</span> is gas, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. Air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And finer than the <span class="Italic">vāyu</span> is the ether, the sky. Finer than the sky is the mind. Finer than the mind is the intelligence, and finer than the intelligence is the soul. So they do not know this. They capture only middle thing, <span class="Italic">vāyu.</span> Wherefrom the <span class="Italic">vāyu</span> came? Wherefrom the gas came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That part remains unanswered. That part cannot be answered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we answer, we answer. We have got the knowledge. The gas came from ether, and ether came from mind, and mind came from intelligence, and intelligence came from the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They will say you cannot prove that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we can prove that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> How will you prove it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see still, gases, I mean to say, cloud is forming in the sky. But you have no eyes to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> With this background before, then that is why they start saying that before Darwin's theory there should be one. That is called chemical evolution. That is called pre-biotic-chemistry. Means before biological evolution started there should be chemical evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that chemical evolution is part of life demonstration. That I have already explained. Just like the chemical, citric acid, coming from lemon tree, a life. It is coming. So all chemicals are being produced... Just like in your body, in my body, there are so many chemicals. Because the body is there, the chemicals are coming. In my urine you will find so much, so many chemicals. In my stool you will find so many chemicals. Wherefrom the chemicals coming? Daily, enzymes, so many other chemicals are coming. Simply the medical man analyzes the urine, and so many chemicals are there. Wherefrom it came? Because I am living entity, the chemicals are coming in my urine, in my stool, in my cough, in my secretion. It is coming. Therefore it is concluded that chemicals are produced by life, not life is produced by chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they are saying that once the seed of life, that is, the cells, the living cells, are built, then it continues automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but who gives the seed? That is answered in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">. Bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām.</span> He gives the seeds, and He is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the scientists are now trying to make the seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then kick on their face with boot. With boot, rascal. You are trying. That is rascaldom. We protest against this. "We are trying." What is this nonsense, trying? Do it immediately. Then we shall accept. Trying, everyone is trying. Just like a child is trying to build a house with this sand. So is that very nice proposal, that here will be house? That is childish. Then you accept that you are child in the field of knowledge. Don't pose yourself that you know everything, or your knowledge is everything. That is our protest. "We are trying." Trying, everyone is trying. What is the difference between the scientists and ordinary man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are saying that they are coming very close.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! That is also another foolishness. That is called will o' the wisp. The ass. Ass is trying to get the grass, and the washerman is showing only, and the ass is advancing, the grass is advancing. (laughter) You see. This is their thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> But in all humility, Śrīla Prabhupāda, supposing that they would succeed in actually creating the living cell artificially, what would we say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the credit there? It is already there. So what credit he can get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Best they just imitated what has already happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imitated. Just like, that I explained also. The example is that when an imitation barking is there, people go and purchase ticket. And when real barking is there, nobody cares. This is their business. They are so fool that their government is purchasing the ticket, and they're hearing the imitation barking. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But once they are successful they are going to make super beings they are called super beings, superhuman beings, super animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they cannot create even an ant, and now they are going to make super beings. This is another foolishness. They cannot create even an ant, moving ant, and they're going to make super being. Just see. And we have to believe them. (laughter) We are not so fools. Your so-called scientists may be fools, but we are not so fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> You give the example of a potter who was dreaming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes, yes, That's it. A potter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This idea Śrīla Prabhupāda, about the chemical evolution, this idea came from, I think, in 1920 by a Russian scientist. He is a biologist. His name is Oparin. So he demonstrated that before biological evolution the atmosphere of the earth should be, he called, very much reducing. Reducing, that means it must be mostly full of hydrogens, no oxygen, very little oxygen, but mostly hydrogen. Then in due course because of the reaction in these hydrogen compounds and the radiation from the sunlight, then these compounds form into different chemicals which are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a side study. But there was hydrogen. Wherefrom the hydrogen came? The scientists, simply they study in the middle. But they do not know what is the origin. Just like here is one aeroplane is coming, and you can say, "All of a sudden a light came out of the sea." Is that the study of this aeroplane? If we... the foolish person will see, "All of a sudden, in the sea there was a light." Is that scientific study? So your study is like that. "There was this, and all of a sudden, by chance..." That's it. That is not scientific study. We have to find out the original cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So in due course if they create these amino acids, there are 20 amino acids which are necessary for the body, for the material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is already created. What is your credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they want to do it themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may do, but already... Just like there is a soap factory. You start another soap factory. So what is your credit? It is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> The big, big soap factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is your credit? Yes. You can imitation, make an imitation. And you want to take credit, all credit, for the original creator, simply by imitating. You are so foolish. Why shall I give you the credit? I shall give credit to the origin. That is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> When they discover a natural law, they name it after themselves, like "Newton's law." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already there, already there, and the rascal wants to take credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They adjust a little bit and they say that they have conquered...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No adjustment. That is another foolishness. You cannot adjust. Even you cannot adjust a moment of nature's law. You cannot adjust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> You just discover it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No discovery. You do not know, arrangement. This is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Practically they are fighting against the laws of nature, but sometimes they find pleasure in doing this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is childish. Just like they build with the sand palatial building, the children, and they take pleasure in it. That's all. That is children's pleasure. That is not sane man's pleasure. <span class="Italic">Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB </span>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">. Māyā-sukhāya.</span> This pleasure is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and they are making humbug. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">vimūḍhān, vimūḍhān,</span> all foolish men. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, <span class="Italic">māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB </span>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">.</span> The materialists, they have created a standard of happiness. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is not happiness. But for that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> happiness, false happiness, they have beget a gorgeous arrangement. That's all. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">vimūḍhān.</span> They are so <span class="Italic">vimūḍhān,</span> so foolish. Now suppose they have created this nice comfortable civilization, but they have not created the situation that they will be able to enjoy it. At any moment they will be kicked out, "Get out! Finished. All finished." So where is that guarantee that you will be able to enjoy this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is why the scientists are saying that God didn't give us everything so that we can make very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then God is there. Accept. Then why do you say there is no God? Then God is life. Then everything comes from life. You have to accept. That is our proposal. If they accept that "God has not given us the capacity," then they are intelligent. They are accepting God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say, "God hasn't given us everything because we are not able to live forever here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? That means God is controller. You are controlled. You admit this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> If these people are allowed to live forever then they will make this place more than a hell, worse than hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) God has given them everything actually, to live peacefully and try to understand God, but that they will not do. They will do something to try to forget God. That is their aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, is it true that if a person is very sinful, he reduces some years from his life? If a person is very, very sinful, extremely sinful, then he reduces some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reduce or increase, what is the profit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We see the practical example. If you are alcoholic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if you reduce or increase, suppose you are to live for hundred years, if you make it hundred and ten, so what is your profit? And if you are to live for hundred years, reduce time ten years, so what is the profit? You cannot live here, that is a fact, reduce or increase. This is all nonsense. What is increase? The trees, they have more longer period, increased the period, of life. Is, that kind of living is very profitable? What for increasing? To suffering? Your life is already suffering. Why you are covering this body? You cannot stand here, open body. That is suffering. You are trying to save yourself from the suffering. This is life, struggle for existence. <span class="Italic">Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati [Bg.<b class="calibre4"> </b></span>15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply struggle. So if you increase your life for struggling again, then what is the profit? This is... The rascals, they do not understand. Even if you increase, what profit you will get? Your life is all suffering. So the foolish persons, they cannot understand. The real problem is how to stop your suffering, reduce or increase, it doesn't matter. But that you cannot do. You'll have to die. This is your suffering. Nobody wants to die. You have to become old man. Suppose an old man, suffering from so many diseases, and he increases his life. What is the profit there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is what they do by heart transplant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is all nonsense. Stop death; then it is an achievement. That's all. Stop disease, that is achievement. But that you cannot do. What is the profit reducing, and increasing or decreasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I am saying therefore, disease, not "This disease" or "That disease." Disease mean any kind of disease. That is credit. That is credit. If you guarantee that "Here is a chemical composition; when a man takes it, no more disease," that is credit. But you cannot do that. Then where is your credit? You simply struggle. The struggle we increase. That's all. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> We shall come down? The water is coming or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Looks like the water is coming up, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The waves are very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, such a huge quantity of coloring, wherefrom coming, red color? And it will disappear after few minutes. Have you got any control over it, scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Now there is a big scarcity of dye, coloring dye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, take from here red color. Yes, they can increase the scarcity. That's all. That is in their power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they will try to make more, reduce the scarcity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is more? Now, because the petrol stock is decreasing, they are disturbed, increase it, increase it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they are trying to make synthetic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again "trying," the same disease, "trying." (laughter) Same disease. Again "trying." That is called... That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati [Bg.<b class="calibre4"> </b></span>15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are simply struggle, struggling with the mind. That is their business. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti-sthāni karṣati.</span> Because he is in this <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> under the control of the material nature, <span class="Italic">prakṛti-sthāni</span>-simply a struggle. And mental concoction: "Now we shall do it. Now we are trying. In future it will be done." <span class="Italic">Manaḥ.</span> This is mind, mental concoction. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti</span> is doing their own duty, by nature's law. Now, by nature's law, the winter season is coming. Stop it. Stop it. Make it summer season. What you can do? Why so many cloths are required? Turn it into summer. You cannot do anything. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi... [Bg. </span>3.27]. The <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is going on, doing its own duty. You cannot check. Now the sun is rising. Now make it dark. Or in the darkness, ask the sun, "Get up." Where is your power? And still you are thinking, that "We are scientists. We are advancing." All foolishness. Just surrender to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> What you can do? You cannot even know how many stars and planets are there. Still unknown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, they say in our universe there are about ten to the eleventh stars. They can count approximately. They say there are about 100 billion stars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Count the sand grains, count the sand grains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They would make a rough estimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Even if you make a fool estimate, then still, you are nothing in the face of the creator. Even if you can count.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They are so stupid Prabhupāda that they do not recognize that the most important things in life is birth, death, old age and disease. And if they really want to conquer the nature, they should try to conquer birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Duratyayā,</span> very hard to overcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They have a whole new department called gerontology to stop death. In one article they had about twenty different methods, and they said all of them, none of them have succeeded yet. But they were very confident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even for them there is some medicine in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> If they go to heavenly planets they will be able to live longer. They are so stupid, <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> class, that they can't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even if they go to heavenly planets by following <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> still they will be able to live longer, but by their mundane efforts they will not be able to increase...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nobody... In the material world there is no question of living forever. That is not possible. That is in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the scientists explain why there are so many varieties of living entities, they have an explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say, "At the time of evolution, the cells, the genes, sometimes..." Normally the gene is perfectly copied for the next generation, but sometimes there is a mistake in copying. Just like in the printing press sometimes we do some mistakes. Just like that, there are some mistakes along the path of evolution. So those mistakes, sometimes they just, according to the circumstances, they can stand, and they form a different living entity because of the difference of the genes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the mistake is continuing forever, because you'll find the varieties of living entities ever-existing. Therefore the mistake is permanent. So when it is permanent, it is not mistake. It is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They'll say if there is no mistake, there will be only one living entity in the whole universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Because you have got different mind, therefore you create different situation. Just like we are walking here. Not that everyone is coming to join us. Because they have got different mentality. They want to sleep. We want to rise early in the morning. Why this difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutaśrava:</span> It is a great mistake they're making.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not mistake. It is your desire. And exactly according to the desire, you get a body. It is not mistake. No. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> At the time of death, whatever you think, exactly nature will give you a similar body. That's all. That is not in your hand. That is in the nature's hand. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But scientifically it can be proved that there is a mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is your mistake. In the laws of nature there is no mistake. There is no mistake. Your mistake. Just like in the railway carriage there is first-class, second-class, third-class. So you have purchased third-class ticket. By mistake, you can go to the first-class and just give him, but you will not be allowed to stay there. So it is your mistake. But these first-class, second-class, third..., that is not a mistake. That is arrangement. Similarly, these varieties... God is so clever that He knows that so many mistakes can be done, and so many varieties are there. As you commit mistake, you enter... "You come here. It is ready." And it is very exact mathematically calculated. Because the nature is working in three modes, so you mix up these three modes, it becomes three into three equal nine, and again you multiply nine into nine, equal to eighty-one. Again eighty-one into eighty-one. So many varieties come. Therefore generally it is taken, 84 million varieties. 8, 400,000. That is already there. Just like government creates a prison house. Although the city is not constructed, but they construct a prison house. Why? The government knows that "There are so many rascals. They will be criminals, they must come here." So it is not government mistakes. Your mistake. You become criminal and come here. It is your mistake. Why should you be criminal? That is your mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And also, if nature made a mistake, then how could nature supply the necessities of all the living entities? After all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no mistake. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10].</span> It is said, <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.</span> Under the supervision of Kṛṣṇa, God, nature is working. How there can be mistake? In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā [Bs. </span>5.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> This nature is working just like shadow. Real direction is from God. <span class="Italic">Icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā.</span> By His will, nature is working. So how He can be mistaken? Nature is working under the will of God; so how there can be mistake in the part of God? There is no mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They use these terms to explain their proposed theory. This terminology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which terminology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Like "mistake" and all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mistake, There cannot be... That is the difference between God and ourself. We are living entity, God is also living entity. But He has no four defects. We have got four defects. We commit mistake, we are illusioned, our senses are imperfect, and we cheat. God does not do all these things. That is the difference between God and ourselves. He does not commit mistake. He is not illusioned. He does not cheat, and His senses are perfect. <span class="Italic">Vedāhaṁ samatītāni</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 7.26]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in technological enlargement or prolongation of our senses, we are also defective, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are defective. This material existence means defective existence. This defection not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> All the microscopes, and electric things, all these things, they are also defective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is made by the imperfect senses. So it must be defective. If you construct something with your defective knowledge, then it must be defective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Even if they make a perfect microscope they still have to look at it through their defective eyes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's it. This is going on. Therefore whatever they are saying, they are all defective. Yes. That is our conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So it is just like playing with fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍha mūḍha mūḍha mūḍha.</span> Defective means <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they seem to be quite satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, ass is also satisfied. By unnecessarily carrying the load of the washerman, he is satisfied. Everyone is satisfied. Even the worms of the stool, he is satisfied. (laughs) That is nature's law. He is satisfied. So this satisfaction</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The saying is "Even the pauper is proud of his penny."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is also... You see... In Vṛndāvana I showed you? The dogs were starving, but as soon as he gets another female dog, oh, he is satisfied. To have sex. Oh. You see. So is that satisfaction? He is starving. The belly has gone down, and still, he is satisfied with sex. You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's called illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is illusion. Actually, he is not satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> You once gave the example, Prabhupāda of the drunkards in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> If they just get a bottle of wine they are satisfied even though they are freezing and starving and have no place to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are satisfied. Real satisfaction will prevail when one knows God. That is real satisfaction. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> A devotee will see how by God's design the sea is working, how the sky is staying, how the sun is rising. He is satisfied, "Oh, how my Lord is great, how He has arranged." That is satisfaction</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But Śrīla Prabhupāda, the living entities, the <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> within the..., and the Paramātmā within, why the living entities suffering even the Paramātmā is directing the living entity within?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not very difficult. Government is always with you, but why you are suffering, and why one is enjoying? Government is not partial. You have created your situation to suffer. That's all. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "You surrender to Me. I will give you all protection." But you will not do. You must suffer. Suffering is there. As soon as you are disobedient to God, immediately suffering begins. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "Now you give up all this nonsense business. Surrender to Me. I will give you all protection." That you will not do. Then you must suffer. That is the song:</div>
<div class="Verse">māyār bośe jāccho bhese<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic">Khāccho hābuḍubu bhāi</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">That is our preaching, that "Why you are suffering? Just accept Kṛṣṇa; you will become happy." That is our preaching. So long you are under the clutches of... (end)</div>
