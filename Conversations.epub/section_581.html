<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This earthly planet also looks bright like the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> At night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when it looks bright?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Well, they say from space, when looking at earth, it is also bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bright. But why daytime it is looking bright? Why it is not bright? The moon is bright still, but is it bright?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is what...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This earthly planet is also bright?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Within this universe are there other planets similar to the earthly planet where the inhabitants are getting the same, similar material bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, every planet there are inhabitants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> But similar to this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (aside:) Don't come very near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> This is called <span class="Italic">martya-loka,</span> and are there other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not similar. Every planet is different from the other. Just like in down planets there is no sunlight, so how they can be one? There the light arrangement is different. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...He displays His Vṛndāvana only on the earthly-like planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Vṛndāvana is there already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's already there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Because I know when He comes to the earthly planet and He displays to the human being, and I know that there's the higher and lower planetary systems, but like when He goes to any universe is it always to the earthly-like planet, lot of times(?) to earth? It's always like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the government has got a circuit house in every big, big cities. Similarly, in every planet there is a replica of Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> But what about Lord Caitanya? He is a little rare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Caitanya, also. All incarnation. [break] ... Difficulty is that these foolish man, they cannot understand that God is a person. Therefore they are puzzled. That is the difficulty. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> The Absolute Truth is manifested in three features: impersonal Brahman, Paramātmā, localized Paramātmā, and Personality of Godhead-that they cannot understand. They take that impersonal Brahman as important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Previously people believed in the personal idea, but now they have become very envious. They have tried to get rid of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More demons. Because with the progress of so-called civilization, people are becoming more and more demons, so they cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti. Mūḍhā,</span> he cannot understand. That is the difficulty. More dull-headed, less intelligent persons are coming. Just see. Formerly there was no skyscraper building. Now they are thinking "So long this body is there, let us enjoy." And the..., in the body, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāra... [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> But the soul is within the body-there is no care. And that he is going to become a dog next life, but he is satisfied that "This life I have got this skyscraper building." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Previously the only big building was the church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Big church or king's royal palace, like that. Ordinary men, they used to live in cottage. That is especially in India. They did not... What is the use? If you are not going to live there... It is a common sense. But they have no idea. They are thinking, "We shall live forever in this house." And Kṛṣṇa says that "I will come as death and take away all your possession." That they cannot understand. They will think that "No, my possession is all. I will die. I will go to hell. Still, it is my possession." This is. He will go to hell; still, his possession. (laughs) This is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> They are so dependent that if there is no electricity, where will they get water on the twentieth floor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, apart from that... There are so many inconveniences. There is no doubt about it. But he is thinking, "Now I have done this skyscraper building, it is my possession, and even though I go to hell, it will remain my possession." He does not believe next life, but he is thinking, "My generation." But if there is no next life, what is the question of generation? Who is coming to become your generation if there is no next life? Hm? "My son, my grandson will..." But who is coming to be your... Because there is no next life, everything is finished with this body, then who is coming to be your son and who is coming to be your grandson? The common sense. But they are so dull, they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> You once told us the story of the rich man, and he died and became a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is also believing next life. But if they do not believe next life, then who is coming to be your son? Why you are so anxious for your son and grandson?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It is simply an accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So for accident you are spending so much money and energy? All contradictory. There is no even common sense. Still, they will not take the actual fact from the authoritative <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">nābhijānāti.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Gentleman):</span> What kind of a sect are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Christian what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa conscious, just tell him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Oh. What country are you from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> India. Well, I'll tell you. It's sort of interesting. I hope you don't feel any affront. And what are you doing now, sort of a meditation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are chanting. Chanting the holy name of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Our whole purpose is to serve God and to revive our love for God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sure. That's right. I understand that, and, you know, I'm very broad-minded. I always have said... You know, one time in our Methodist church we had a professor that was giving all religions of the world. And this is rather putting it simply and fast, but it was interesting because of all the different religions, even though they all didn't believe in the divine being, Christ being the son of God, in some cases-there's Buddha and so forth-but they all were preaching about going to the same place, so to speak. And it's peculiar. They all had more or less the Ten Commandments. In other words they all believed in doing the same thing. So that was interesting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I don't think Christians believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So I know you people are good, just as good as I am. Bless you all, and I wish I and all of us were better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think Christians believe in the Ten Commandments?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We think we do, I guess, but we don't practice it, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christ says, "Thou shalt not kill." So why they are killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, you're right. But, you know, up the road someplace maybe there's an answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe up the road there's an answer someplace, but we're too slow in arriving there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no answer. The Lord says, "Thou shalt not kill." Why you are killing? Who is a Christian? If you don't obey the order of Christ, how you become a Christian? You cannot say that you are Christian if you disobey the order of Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, I know. You're right. You can't kill...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you don't carry out the order of the government, then you are not a good citizen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now, you look like you're either English or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are neither English nor American. We are servant of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I know. You're brotherhood of man. But just my own curiosity... Of course, you have converts of all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No convert. Actually we are. Just like you have got this different dress from me. That does not mean you are convert to the dress. You are a gentleman; I am a gentleman. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I don't know whether I'm a gentleman or not. I'm just a man, and pretty lowly as far as my own opinion's concerned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So different dress does not mean converts. We are in different dress, American body or Indian body or this body, black body or... This is body. But we are within the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is the symbol of the staff here? There's a symbol of that, is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a big thing to be understood. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Can't be answered in one sentence, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the symbol... That requires good explanation. If you come to our temple, then we shall inform you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (laughs) Good talking to you folks. You know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom you are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Indianapolis, Indiana. You ever hear of that? Yes. Five-hundred-mile race.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is in America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> It's the all-American city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You know where the Great Lakes are in the United States? Just right down south from there, about a hundred, 150 miles south of Indianapolis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no temple there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> We've been there many times for <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, you folks are good people. God bless you. And, you know, sometimes it takes a little nerve to come up and stop you. But I was just curious. An awful lot of people might be, and they do a little staring, but they never get enough guts up to stop and talk to you. And I thought I'd do that. It's nice talking to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Can you say that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Can I say what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Hariyay Kṛṣṇa? Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. Very good. (man departs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Should we tell all Christians like that, Śrīla Prabhupāda? That they're killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) They are killing actually. They are maintaining slaughterhouse. What kind of Christian they are, I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> He admitted it, that they say it, but they really don't follow it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you don't follow the Christian principles, then how you are a Christian? Just to make a show-bottle. They don't believe in next life, don't believe in the Ten Commandments. Christ said, "Thou shalt not kill," and they killed first of all Christ. This is the followers. The instruction is "Thou shall not kill," but they said, "First of all let us kill you. Then we shall follow your instruction." This is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> "That's all right, though. We have been saved. We have been saved by Christ. We have accepted the baptism, so we are saved."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So what is the use of their church and preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, we want to tell the others so they can also be saved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the Christian churches, all the priests, they eat meat. They're supporting everything, homosex, everything, man to man marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Now they are making women the priests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Women priest. Women priest, there was none before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Still not very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The Protestants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> That is a nice <span class="Italic">pandal.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We shall go farther or return? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> He was from a small city. He knew us, and he'd seen us before. People, they can't help but notice us. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...follow Kṛṣṇa consciousness very strictly and very seriously like, say, for the rest of our lives, is there a chance that we'll be able to see Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in this life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is stated, "If you simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then you go back to home." <span class="Italic">Janma karma ca me divyam [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is stated. If you simply understand how Kṛṣṇa takes birth, how He goes away, why does He come, what is His mission, these things, if you can understand, then you are a fit candidate to go back to home. So that is explained everything in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You try to understand. Then you are guaranteed. Where is the difficulty? And if you think, "Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary man like us," then finished. Then do not understand Kṛṣṇa. If you simply accept this word faithfully, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Everything is Kṛṣṇa," then your knowledge is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Even if we don't understand Kṛṣṇa completely... Even if we don't understand Kṛṣṇa completely, if we just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is complete understanding, that "Everything is Kṛṣṇa." That's all. That is a fact. Everything is the energy of Kṛṣṇa. Just like in this material world everyone knows everything is the sunshine. Due to the sunshine, everything is coming. That's a fact. Science...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What do you say about the weather or the sun or what... You just were talking before she interrupted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Weather is changing. Weather is changing. <span class="Italic">Śītoṣṇa,</span> it is called <span class="Italic">śītoṣṇa.</span> Sometimes it is cold; sometimes it is hot.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have been in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No. I often wanted to go, but I really never had a chance.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Try to understand the philosophy. Your life will be successful. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Um hm. I've heard a lot about it. I've read in the books too. Some of those books I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I'm just fascinated. My business is catamaran. I own one catamaran business, yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You know, we are pretty well the first people to see you really, you know. We've all seen you in the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Bye bye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You have more admirers here than in Juhu Beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes, they are also admirer, provided... Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kenichiwa</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Japanese?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep some books in the all tourist shop. It will be sold. [break] She has got my books. Might have purchased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> On the street. We are always here, every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...as young man, say, twenty-two, twenty-three. In Jagannātha Purī I used to take bath in the sea. At that time I had energy to take bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Jagannātha Purī is nice sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> Called <span class="Italic">mahā-tīrtha</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After that, I don't remember I ever took bath in the sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> The water is very warm here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> You were taking bath in Yamunā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I was regularly, when I was in Vṛndāvana. In childhood I was going with my father to take bathing in the Ganges, Calcutta. That I was going regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> It requires a lot of strength to bathe in the sea. You're being tossed very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...so many seeds are there? And as many seeds, as many trees are there. And each fruit, thousands of fruits there, and millions of seeds are there, and millions of trees are there. Where is that scientist, put into that small packet millions of trees like that? Millions of big trees are within this packet. Where is that scientist? Put in a packet, you take, and millions of trees you grow? And without any expenditure, they are present there. If you like, you can take. What the scientists will answer? "Yes, in future we shall do." In future you will do. That's all right. But why don't you give credit who has done already? You are taking credit by post-dated check, and one is actually paying cash, he has no credit. You are giving a false check, post-dated, and you want to take credit. And one who is paying cash immediately, he has no credit. Just see how foolish they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> They cannot even appreciate something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They say, "Don't talk of God." That is their philosophy. (Gets into car) Post-dated check, they want all credit, and one who is paying cash, he has no credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> "Well, we can't see Him, so we can't believe it. We can't see who has done it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you cannot see that the tree, wherefrom this tree has come. From the seed: you cannot see it? You are so blind? Why don't you see? Wherefrom this big tree has come? And such millions of big trees are on the floor. You cannot see it? Then you are blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It comes from that little seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone knows that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But the seed came from another tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But who has made this arrangement, packed up, millions of trees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's just part of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then nature is your father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are less than the nature, that you have to accept. Nature has already done. So either you say "nature" or "God," doesn't matter. But you are not bigger. You cannot take the credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No, we are sons of nature, so nature is greater than us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Sons of nature," that's all right. But why do you take credit, why do you want to take credit more than nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But we'd just like to understand how to use nature, how to work with nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> No, it says, if you follow the Bible, it says that there was a... God created...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't follow anything. They don't follow their own... (laughs) Whims, that's all. If you follow Bible, what do the Bible says? Bible says about God. They don't believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> They're rubbish people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rubbish. That is right conclusion. All rascals and rubbish. That is the right conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just like that man this morning said, "Well, we believe in the Ten Commandments, but we don't follow them. We believe in God, but we don't follow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What kind of belief if you don't follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> "Well, we believe, but we find it too difficult."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then go to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> "Well, we've accepted Jesus, and he's going to save us. That's why we've accepted him. If you accept him in your heart, then he'll save you even though you might be weak at the time of temptation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who is going to hell? If everyone is saved like that, then who is going to hell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> "Well, not everyone will accept Jesus in their heart. So those people have to go to hell."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Has Jesus Christ said like that, that "Those who believe in me, they will be saved"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, he says like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So believing means "I don't accept your commandments." Is that belief? Has Jesus Christ that "You don't believe in my commandments, but you believe in me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Christ never spoke the commandments. That was Moses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't take Bible. Throw it away. Then don't bring Bible as authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> They have no argument on any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...fallen from their original culture. Still, we have seen, as soon as there is Kṛṣṇa conscious festival, thousands and thousands of men... That we have experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpa:</span> But in India it seems that no matter what you tell them, they don't change their ways. They have their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they believe in Kṛṣṇa, "He is God." <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That they believe in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But that's what the Christians say. "We believe in Christ," but they don't follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They follow Him. In India they still. Majority follow. The non-followers are minority. (end)</div>
