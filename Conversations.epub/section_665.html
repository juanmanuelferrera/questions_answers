<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is this? [break] Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> They don't like <span class="Italic">nim?</span> The flies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That ask them. (laughter) You do not expect all answers from me, whether the flies like or not like. This is antiseptic. <span class="Italic">Nim</span> is very, very antiseptic. Therefore it is natural, the flies and bugs, they are afraid of. Yes. [break]...here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's the purchaser.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He does shopping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Namaskar.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Long Hindi conversation with someone) Dandhariya. Where is he? (Hindi) He knows how to capture. He is the... (Hindi) Guṇārṇava, he has not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is going to Mathurā? You told him? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He is going after breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What is the purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> To meet Prabhupāda's relative, I think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have told?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So from Mathurā he can bring that medicine. You can give him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Castor oil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I'll tell him, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, castor oil can be had...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'll have him bring it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take the vial. There is, what is called? <span class="Italic">Sadhana ausadhalaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Dakkha.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dakkha ta.</span> (Hindi) From there you have to take it. <span class="Italic">Sadhana.</span> On the bottle it is written there. (Hindi exchange with someone) They will never take seriously your Māyāvāda philosophy. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa aparādhī.</span> They are offender to Kṛṣṇa, all these Māyāvādīs. And in Vṛndāvana this Māyāvādī philosophy has become very strong. Even the so-called Vaiṣṇavas, they are also... (Hindi) Buddhist, they say that there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They can't believe God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, they deny. Therefore we call them atheist. But these Māyāvādī, they take the shelter of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and they preach the same philosophy. "Yes, <span class="Italic">brahman-nirakara.</span>" (Hindi) ...don't believe in God... (Hindi) For the time being, Śaṅkarācārya might have said something like that to turn the Buddhists again to <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but that is temporary. But they have taken it all true. (Hindi) ...eighty-five years they are working. They have no position. (Hindi) What is that? TM?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> TM, Transcendental Meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is the items they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No philosophy, no belief, no restrictions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Just see. He advertises. Mahesh Yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Mahesh Yogi, yes. Followers, they are taking everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says, "There is no restriction, or no philosophy, no faith." (Hindi conversation) Recently one book was published by Professor Judah. He has studied this movement for five years. He came to India. So he has written one book, <span class="Italic">Hare Kṛṣṇa and Counterculture,</span> but scholarly. (Hindi) He appreciated. (Hindi) ...and the fifty books I have, four hundred pages each. And we</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">are selling twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth monthly. (Hindi) [break] ...it is up to that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Nobody knows your limit, Prabhupāda. Nobody knows your limit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, generally. Who remembers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It was way back there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It was back there by that... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No, no. I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I think it was here somewhere. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ants are freely moving. They do not know it is dangerous. Similarly, all these living entities in material world, they think, "It is not dangerous. It is all right." Ant civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is there some worship of God in the animal kingdom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Hut hut hut hut!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "<span class="Italic">Hut" </span>will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Stick will do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least show. [break] Trees and other lower animals, they are abiding by the order of Kṛṣṇa. That is worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But is it voluntary or involuntary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By force. By force now this tree is standing. He has to stand up here. It cannot move an inch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Is that considered worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Indirect worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...indirect worship, abiding. Just like you don't worship the government, revolt. But when you are put into jail you have to worship the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> We don't worship, yet we don't break the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot break the law. Outside you break law. That you can do. But when you are put into jail, then you cannot. And jail means unless the government finds that you are now obedient to the government laws... (dog growling and barking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Hut!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is taking our shelter, (laughter) the other dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I've seen dogs follow <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party for many miles. Once a dog was following, and he had <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> he had a <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> mark on his head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Who? Who marked it? Somebody? No, no. You should not do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Did someone put <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> on the dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Oh, I mean to say the color of his body was such.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is another thing. But you cannot put <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> Don't make tilaka so cheap. Natural <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee (2):</span> If a devotee step on the ant, does the ant receive some benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee (2):</span> If a devotee step on a ant by mistake, the ant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should be careful. Why should you commit mistake? But if unconsciously, by mistake it is done, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He wants to know does the ant receive benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Then he will be lenient to kill them to give them benefit. (laughter) He'll be so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like they say "mercy killing," that "This is good for you. I will kill you and it is good for you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You should always think that you are responsible for its killing. But it may be Kṛṣṇa may excuse you. That is another thing. Consciously you cannot kill. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...people in India, Prabhupāda, are still pure vegetarians, but almost all of their children eat eggs, and try to smoke cigarettes, and they don't stop them because they don't have any philosophy because of the Māyāvādī philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Almost 90% of all the people we preach to, they are all influenced by Māyāvādī philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I was talking. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...say that the egg is from God, and the apple is from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you eat apple? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They are also envious of you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. Do they say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Not directly. But when we explain how many things, what is being done and we show photographs, how people have become devotees, they will say, "Yes, but have you heard of Swami so and so?" And we'll say, "Yes, we have heard of him. But our Guru Mahārāja has got thousands of devotees all over the world." "Yes, he has also got thousands of devotees." They'll minimize, even though it's there in black and white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where they are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah. Where are those thousands of disciples of these other swamis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Here we are, but where are the swami's disciples?" Ask them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Then they will become angry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "No, no. Well, don't be angry. Well, Bhaktivedanta Swami's disciples, we are present here. Present anyone else. So how shall I believe you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Then they will say, "We are doing the same as you. But we don't have to help you because we are already doing the same thing. We are feeding the poor, giving charity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But yet their children are eating eggs, giving up. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...say that they are doing the same thing that we are doing, then that should be a reason to help us, not to not help us. If we're doing the same thing, therefore if you are helping one, then you must help the other also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. That's what I tell them. They say, "We already helped the other, but you came too late, so therefore we can't help you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "So you are so poor?"-(aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa-"that you cannot help the second man? Then how you are charitable? You must be open to give charity to everyone." No use talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee (1):</span> They are very rich, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They are very rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Richer than us? (laughter) Do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many branches he has got of his business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So I usually tell them, "It is not for us that we want help, but so that we can help others." They like that. They can appreciate humanitarian viewpoint, material benefit. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are giving the best humanitarian service-to stop his repetition of birth and death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The final solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This is the final solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> In India, now in the cities, wherever we go, there are so many big cinema houses being built. So if the young people are not yet tired of that, then how will we convince them of Kṛṣṇa consciousness? They all go by the thousands to the cinema house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You approach the cinema proprietor and make him a member. We have got contribution from a very big cinema man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Raj Kapoor has become a patron member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can show his letter, how he appreciates. So similarly, you can collect some money. So this money is coming from the cinema visitors, so indirectly they will be benefited. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Money is there, and they give. Still they'll go on showing the nonsense, and all the young people are going and being corrupted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on everywhere, not only in the cinema, <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> So our duty is to take some service; then they will be benefited by that. <span class="Italic">Kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you do doesn't matter. The result, give Me." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee (2):</span> They go to cinema because they have no adventures in their life. So they go to cinema. If they become Kṛṣṇa conscious, so they don't need to go to cinema.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa conscious is not so cheap. Have you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Don't take Kṛṣṇa consciousness so cheap that they will go to cinema and become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, he says that if they become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then they will stop going to the cinema.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the test. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> This is the test. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> Advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness means he's no more interested with anything material. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. There is a Bengali proverb, <span class="Italic">ami dugdha khaya eta mako khaya:</span> "The children, they take milk, and adults, they smoke." So one is speaking that "I take milk and smoke also."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He thinks he's all right. "I'm okay."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "I go to temple and I do all nonsense also." Hare Kṛṣṇa. We shall go directly temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
