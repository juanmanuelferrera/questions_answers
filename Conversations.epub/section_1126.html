<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they have never used it against us. But now they have started. One devotee, a girl from Berkeley temple who is a very big book distributor... Sometimes she could collect five, six hundred dollars in one day. She was just kidnapped-by order of the court. They have a psychologist who listens to the parents' description, and on the basis of that secondhand report the psychologist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, kidnapping, that is already law there. If one is minor or without the permission of the parent, with police force she or..., can be kidnapped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But this is not for minors. This is for adults.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a new thing, that the psychologist will write some report to the court that "Based on the information I have received, this person is not mentally competent. Therefore this person must be put under the guardianship of their parents even if they are an adult. Otherwise they will harm themselves." So in this way the psychologists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But any psychologist will give report or anyone can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Anyone. You just pay him, and he'll give you a report. They are rascals. And then the court issues an order that "Now this person's freedom is taken away," and she's put under the charge of her family for thirty days. Then they come with the police, and they give the paper, and they take her away by force, and they fly her to one of these camps where they harass her for thirty days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Brainwash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Try to break their faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Actually they are brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this can be done by law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have some law, and they are misusing it for this purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well we have... I mentioned we have got these lawyers who want to start a nationwide organization to fight this law for us. So the head of this group is in San Francisco...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the... Externally, it appears that anyone can be kidnapped simply by the certificate of the psychologist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. That is the real point, that this is like Nazi Germany. This is insane. So because it is so anti-American, then many people who would not normally connect themselves with our movement are now coming forward to help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they must. Otherwise the freedom is lost. Anyone can be kidnapped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is what they are realizing, that this may not stop at just Hare Kṛṣṇa. They can kidnap anyone. That's our propaganda to get support.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like emergency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Russia they do that. When they don't like someone, they put him in a mental home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That was that whole article I brought from page one of <span class="Italic">L.A. Times,</span> that how they have made this legal. And now they have got tax exemption. So now it's going to increase. For the next year it's going to increase, because they're going to get a lot of money from the families as tax write-offs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tax invention? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They call themselves educational organizations. They are educating the public because they do speaking engagements at colleges and different places. So on the basis of that, they applied to the federal government, "Please, we are just an educational group. You must give us tax exemption." So they have been given that. Now people can donate money to them. Instead of paying taxes to the U.S. government, they can donate money to them in exchange for paying taxes. (laughs) So the fighting will get more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This year, definitely. But that means more propaganda for us, more publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. (chuckling)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And I look forward to it, because we'll smash them in each confrontation. They now realize that when they have a debate against us, they always lose. We have had maybe five or six confrontations in Los Angeles on television and on the radio, and every time they lose. And every time they go away like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) You can keep there under the bath section. I'll wash there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So actually we're getting all this free exposure on radio and on television. And each time we come off sounding very intelligent, very religious, very nice, and they come off sounding like fanatics and bigots. So people are getting a good impression of us because of the publicity on radio and television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Sītā was put into the fire and she came out unburned. Sītā was blasphemed, that "This woman was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa, and Rāmacandra is so henpecked that He has again picked up her and living with her." So Rāmacandra put him (her) in the fire and she came unharmed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You were asking me what is the use of, say, if you came to America, if you were on television. But actually people are very interested in this issue, so they will listen. They are listening to see us, hoping that we will be exposed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, Hari-śauri was (saying) that there are many fanatics. They may attack me: "He's the man who has started this movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> These deprogrammers will go to any length.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They'll do anything to stop it. You'd have to have professional bodyguards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This Reverend Moon, he is not being attacked. The other leaders aren't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I think you should carry on your fighting from India through your other men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Or at least a place like Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I feel if you went to America during this fight it may be very dangerous also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because there's a lot of crazy... These people are crazy. But you could give your orders from India, and this way the fight can go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hawaii is unaffected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Hawaii is not involved so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Still, if they heard he was in Hawaii they may go there. No one will come to India, to Bhuvaneśvara. It's dangerous there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But we were just thinking that if Prabhupāda spends a few months every year outside of India, his time won't be so occupied by all the particular management things that he has to think about in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Give Prabhupāda some relief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There'll be some relief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> At least when you go to Hawaii you always get a good rest and there's no visitors, and it's very... Your translation work increases tremendously. It's very nice there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our immediately problem is toward my health. I am not digesting food, so therefore there is some swelling in the hands and the legs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's due to the kidney?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kidney or whatever it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So is it affecting your translation work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not affected. That is going on. I have translated today seventeen volumes (verses?). That does not affect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So what to do? (Prabhupāda turns on dictaphone, then off. On again-reading verse) This is the twenty-fourth chapter, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Text five. How many verses are there in this chapter? You know, Hari-śauri? It's very exciting, because it's just about to begin the Tenth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Pradyumna was telling me how the last verses of the chapter describe the appearance, getting ready for the appearance of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sixty-seven. I am on the five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think the pen's still in the case. Or the pencil's still in the red case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We know you have a very low opinion of doctors. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I wish to die without a doctor. Don't... When I am... It may be. I may be seriously, but don't call doctor. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't be disturbed. Everyone has to die. Let us die peacefully, without doctor. All this medicine, injections, and prohibitions, this, that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tīrtha Mahārāja had all kinds of machines. Still didn't save him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and depend on Kṛṣṇa. Actually... <span class="Italic">Nārtasya cāgadam udanvati majjato nauḥ.</span> That is the Prahlāda Mahārāja's verse. Find out this. <span class="Italic">Bālasya neha śaraṇaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha.</span> Seventh Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Volume Two. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What was that again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bālasya.</span> B-a-l-a.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Bālasyāntaḥpura-sthas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bālasya neha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Bālasya neha. Bālasya neha śaraṇaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha nārtasya cāgadam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nārtasya cāgadam udanvati majjato nauḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihāñjaseṣṭas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ihāñjaseṣṭas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Tāvad vibho tanu-bhṛtāṁ tvad-upekṣitānām</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>7.9.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tvad-upekṣitānām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "My Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and not cared for by You cannot do anything for their betterment."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Whatever remedies they accept, although perhaps temporarily beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient, and a boat on the ocean cannot protect a drowning man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are facts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That's ultimately, but maybe we could give you some temporary relief so we don't feel... Because when you are ill, we feel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is... But for that, no severe treatment should be accepted. Better not to take. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the past, when your health has not been good, they have begun chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa in all the temples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> ...all around the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Special, additional <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Perhaps we should institute that. That would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you... Not for my health you do your <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> only then. That first stroke in Second Avenue, that was fatal. You were present, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. I went to the hospital with Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa saved. Otherwise that was fatal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> The doctor said that "How is it that he is still here?" They said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> When you had that attack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, ha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It was during the... You were lecturing on <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> in the morning lectures you were giving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I can remember. And one morning you said you were not feeling well. And the doctor said... I can remember. Your left side was paralyzed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Paralyzed, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Left side. And this is most dangerous, the doctor said. Maybe for swelling we can increase the massaging to three times a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's what this guy told me, not to massage very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> At least not while the swelling is there. Actually that medicine that Shiv Sharma gave you, that was reduced. I don't think this homeopathic medicine is any good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can give me that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> My father, he also used to get swelling, but this was due to diabetes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got diabetes also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He was getting swelling in his legs and hands. But he had to take this insulin, and this kept the swelling nil by taking insulin. Every morning he would give himself a shot. But he had no more swelling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He'd just stick a needle in his arm every morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many gentlemen who take insulin twice, at least once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The diabetics. They have diabetes. Very common. We have a devotee who does that. This boy in New York whose parents have kidnapped him many times. He is actually... That's their charge against us, that "Oh, my son is diabetic, and you are not spending $25,000 on doctors. You are not taking care of him." That is their charge against us. Then Ādi-keśava Mahārāja said, "All right, if you want him to have such excellent medical treatment, you give us the money and we'll spend it on it." So then the parents say, "Just see! Blackmail." That is a big charge in the paper. It's called extortion. Ādi-keśava Mahārāja was indicted for kidnapping and for extortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's that Ed Shapiro.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. The parents cheated again. They said, "Just see, blackmail."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's how that charge came up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. They lie and say, "This president, he said, 'If you do not give us this money, we will let your son die.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He didn't write it, did he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, it was on the telephone. But he has been charged by a Grand Jury of attempted extortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can never prove that. It's ridiculous. </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I have heard that now, this month, we have already been on the biggest television shows in America, big night shows. They have these shows that go two, three hours at a time, and everyone in America watches them. Forty million people watch them. So we've already been on those shows now. Our devotees have already been on those shows now because of this controversy. We're becoming more famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You are getting everyone to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. <span class="Italic">Yadaiva śraddhāiva</span>(?). Some way or other, let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. So that is being done, whole countrywide. It has become a national show. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> All over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Every town and village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> If you ask them who is Vivekananda, no one knows. But everyone knows Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are known as "Hare Kṛṣṇas," and sometimes "Kṛṣṇas."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They call us the "Harries."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the deprogrammer newsletter that we intercepted, they did not like to chant so much, so after awhile they just started saying "The HKs." They didn't want to say the whole name of God. You noticed that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, "H," to pronounce it, and "Hare," Hare is shorter. "H." It is a long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But for writing, "HK."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Writing, you can, but if you say, "HK," it is not shorter than Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is longer than Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Anyway, whenever they see "HK," they are thinking in their mind, "Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the news of Germany?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The news from Germany? I have not heard any change-except that Satsvarūpa's men, they began... Just before Christmas the schools close. They began to go to Germany to take standing orders, and it was the most difficult country, they said, very difficult. And because... One of the reasons is they have such a very bad opinion of us. The church is against us. But still, they managed to get a few standing orders, and then the schools closed for Christmas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Any reviews?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not yet. They just began. Now they are spending this month, January and February, in Germany. This will be very valuable for our case there, if the scholars begin appreciating us from a different angle. But meanwhile, book distribution is bigger than ever in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the proof we are gaining ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The two champion big-book distributors are both German boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. They have outdistributed everyone, even in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.</span> Just see how small animal it is, and how freely it is going. Let them manufacture a small animal like this with chemicals. It has got all the symptoms of animal. It has got the desire. It has thinking, feeling, willing, then eating, sleeping, mating. Everything is there. And as such, the anatomic physiology is there, within such a full stop. Everything is there. If you check them going here, they'll protest. And wherefrom they are coming? Where they are going? Just see how small it is. You cannot see even with naked eyes, so small. But it has all life symptoms. And they say there is no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, it is some wonderful chemical mixture that they have not discovered yet, very mysterious chemistry. It is all based on this idea of a study of genes and chromosomes, genetics. They have so many words for describing how it happens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jugglery, word jugglery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> DNA, RNA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But they still can't explain the power force that activates them. They still can't explain the actual source of power that activates those chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the late 1800's there was a very famous story in America called Frankenstein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This Doctor Frankenstein, he took dead bodies from the graveyards, and he sewed them together, and then, by electrical energy, it charged...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...like a battery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Young Frankenstein." Oh, I have seen that picture. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But actually people all over the Western world then became convinced that one day science will create life. This popularized the idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How rascal they have been educated. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And the only problem was he had the wrong brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They took the brain from a known criminal and put it inside the dead man. So when he came back to life he was a demon. That's their only problem, they say. If they'd only taken a brain from a dead body who was a good man, then everything would have been all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you not take the brain of scientist and make another scientist? Why you should, they should regret "That this scientist is dead"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's their goal. That is their goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Goal that may be, but what they have done? That is the first thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then another goal they have is, by controlling the genes, they expect that one day they will be able to produce many men with the same talents, with the same physical appearance, duplicate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Will," everything "will." (chuckles) Never practical. Such a rascal, they are going on as scientists. Everything in future. "Trust no future, however pleasant." And they are depending everything on future. "Yes, we are trying. We shall do it within millions of years." And people believe that. <span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because there's no God, so this is the only hope-science. The only hope for immortality is science. That's what people think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That means people want to believe in immortality. They want eternal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is factual. Nobody wants to die. Even on death bed, one thinks, "If something could have been done for my saving..." One gentleman in Allahabad, he was our friend. So he was dying at the age of fifty-four. So he was requesting the doctors, "Can you not prolong my life for four years more? Then I could finish my scheme." Such a madman. What is nonsense scheme? <span class="Italic">Āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ kāma...</span> Find out this, <span class="Italic">āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>īhante kāma-bhogārtham<br class="calibre2"/>anyāyenārtha-sañcayān</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anyāyenārtha-sañcayān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to one's <span class="Italic">karma,</span> or activities in this world. Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am talking of that man. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "...who even at the point of death was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man's desire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy. The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in Vedic literature, the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> there are two birds sitting in one tree. One is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith. Therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> So on the whole, people are in darkness. And that is going on as advancement. This is the only institution to give them some light. There is no doubt about it. All in the darkness. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are in darkness, and some leader comes, he is also in the darkness, and both of them fall into the ditch. This is going on. Do you agree to this point? Otherwise you cannot become good preacher. You must yourself, must be convinced that actually this is the position. All these rascals, scientists, philosophers, politicians-they're all in darkness, and they're misguiding people. That's all. One of the first-class rascal in darkness is your Darwin. He's in favor of Darwin's theory. Another first-class demon is that Freud. (laughter) These are the guides of the modern civilization. Anthropomorphism. No? What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Anthropology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anthropology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Now the latest demon is the one who says the population theory, overpopulation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He is causing the trouble now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because everyone is ghostly-haunted and speaking all nonsense. <span class="Italic">Piśācī pāile yena mati-cchana haya, māyār grasta jīvera sei dāsa upajaya.</span> One who is under the control of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he speaks like ghostly-haunted man-all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They're actually ghostly-haunted, or as if ghostly-haunted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ghostly-haunted. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is acting as ghost. They attack mostly their guardians-father, mother. These ghostly-haunted men becomes very inimical to the guardians and wants to kill them. Many cases. And abuses the father, mother, like anything. "Ah! You rascal! Why you have come? I shall kill you!" Like that. I have seen it. Mad, you call, or ghostly-haunted. Very dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> What is the cure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No cure. He must die. No cure. These hospitals are there, mental. They keep in the mental hospital. But ultimately there is no cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I read one... In a purport you said that <span class="Italic">hari-nāma</span> can even cure insane people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Hari-nāma</span> can cure anything. You have kept there. All right.</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>January 19, 1977, Bhuvaneśvara</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...available plots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, there's those two plots on that main... Now, there's many broken buildings there, many. I drove all around. But the plots are too small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You'd have to buy several of them together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. And also they're out of the city. They're more out of reach. They're not in that... That one area is the best area. There's a two-lane road. You know, traffic going one way and traffic going another way with an island in the center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And all the hotels are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And all the hotels are there, so all the top people are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It sounds like Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And that Purī hotel was packed up with foreigners and with local people very nicely dressed. And this plot is just near the Purī hotel. So it's a nice area, and the breeze is wonderful, very nice breeze from the ocean. So if we build a nice multi-story, that breeze will be very healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So I have to leave here tomorrow morning at 8:30 and meet with the man at around 9:30, 10:00, and he'll give me all the names and addresses, and he'll show me some other plots. Then, perhaps, if maybe you would like to see it the following day, we can drive there and show you the plot as soon as I get more information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Would you like to do that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Have you been to Purī for a long time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, several times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I mean in recent years or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Recently I'm not going because my disciples are not allowed. I don't wish to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I was here during <span class="Italic">Durgā-pūjā,</span> and there were thousands of people entering that temple, thousands. I mean... There was just a tide all day long. So I know if we have a temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Last I went to see, before going to USA, in 1958.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Almost twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. 1958, yes. After that, I had no chance of going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There's no doubt that if we build a temple there it must be very, very magnificent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because after some years I went to USA, in 1966, er '65. 1958 or '59, I went there. For four, five years naturally. And after going to USA there was no chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> In front of the temple, though, is so many beggars. You cannot walk peacefully. In front of the temple so many beggars, and no one is giving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In 1920 I came to Bhuvaneśvara. So I was thronged with so many beggars. So at that time I promised, "If I bring at least"-in those days-"more than one thousand rupees to distribute to the beggars, then I shall come. I'll not come." (laughs) I thought like that. Means whatever money I had I will distribute. Still, they are thronging, the beggars. So much beggars have now come. Beggars. Very poor country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We could have very big <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution there, in Purī. Right on the beach we could set up a whole <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you arrange for <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution, you become very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> None of the tourists who are Westerners ever takes Jagannātha <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> do they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if there is good <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> they'll take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Tourists... We'll send in the sweet shops, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they understand they are very palatable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But that beachfront, if we're on there, we can use that beach as a place to feed thousands of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Of course, all the pilgrims that come to Purī for the temple festivals, they'll also come to our temple if it is very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But what style will it be? It will be a different style of architecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana? That will be new introduction here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Vṛndāvana's not a very big temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not big, but... Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's the same, along the same lines at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Shouldn't it be higher than the Purī temple or less?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We can make it higher for not too much extra cost. The height is not that expensive. I was talking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Height should be... Because you can see Purī temple from the road ten miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It would be suitable, appropriate, if this temple was taller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> 'Cause then it could be seen from miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Bombay temple was restricted for height. Otherwise it was going to be higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because along the road, say about ten kilometers, they have a sign, "Look to your right, and you will see Purī in your sight." They have a sign, like a poem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Along the road. They say, "Look to your right, and you will see Lord Jagannātha temple in your sight." And sure enough, you see, coming up, about ten miles out of the city, that temple. So similarly if we have a very high temple it can be seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Look to your left." (chuckling) This is very exciting, this idea of building in Purī. And Prabhupāda said the main Deities would be Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If we build in Purī, will we have Jagannātha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jagannātha, Nitāi-Gaura, Guru-Gaurāṅga...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, like Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That will also be very wonderful, to have Lord Gaurāṅga on the altar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's very important now, Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very big Deities. That would be good if there were big Gaura-Nitāi Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, there should be huge Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like in Hyderabad. There's those very big Deities there, five feet or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five feet? Deity we can get it done here also. But there is no white stone. Stone is available here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, stone they have, but no marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything made of iron corrodes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Iron. Yes. We have to be very careful of the type materials that we use. Also near the sea, I think on cement that has some effect. We'd have to make the temple out of stone or marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that it will last...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...many centuries. Hundreds of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Because I have seen all of the cement buildings. Within five or ten years it's finished. You have to put a new plastering. So I think we have to use either stone or marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> White marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Whew! That's expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Stone is not so bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If you have stone and cover it with marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, it depends what type of stone. They have that red stone in Rajasthan, like in Vṛndāvana. You've seen that red stone? Very nice. They're using that in... I saw a big hotel in Bombay. They have used that stone, very beautiful, that red stone that you see in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Red stone. That is very durable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That <span class="Italic">Kesi-ghāṭa,</span> that is made of that red stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They're using it, I saw, in one hotel on the front in Bombay, very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> In Bombay. I saw while we were driving in a taxi downtown. It's a new hotel, and they had that red stone. It's the first time I saw it in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. The red stone is very durable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But the building... Whatever building we build would require much maintenance due to the fact that it's near the ocean. Like I've noticed fans. They rust when they're near the ocean. So they probably would have to painted once a year. We'd have to paint at least once a year, paint everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything made of iron will corrode.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore this reinforced concrete is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. Unless it is, we put marble over it. Then it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, bricks also fade away. I have seen. The bricks have become so small on those buildings, the ones, the buildings that are broken down. Those buildings can't be more than twenty or thirty years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. I saw one... In Gopalpur I saw one built in 1938 called Blue Haven, and there was nothing left of it. The whole thing just corroded away. There was just a few things left. And the sign, the marble sign said 1938.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 1930 is very recent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So that's a matter of thirty, fourty years. There was nothing left of the cement, and the bricks were finished. So we'd have to take careful advice of making it out of stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Stone or marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bhuvaneśvara you can have stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> To build such a big temple you'll need many devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Pūjārīs,</span> cooks, collectors, life members. You need at least fifty devotees. So it's going to take a little while to get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big temple means at least fifty men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But I know there'll be no problem getting people there. It's real nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The thing is if we start off, gradually, as the construction is going on, if there's a group of people that are working there, maybe some local people will join us too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, yes. We'll get local men to join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So who will make that their...? That's the real question. Who will sit there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I'll stay. I'll stay. Important project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Coconut tree can grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. And I think cashew. These cashews they also grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cashew. And <span class="Italic">jao.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> What is <span class="Italic">Jao</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is called, <span class="Italic">jao</span>? This fiberlike bricks. That is grown very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Some kind of a fruit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No fruit. Evergreen. It is called evergreen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, yes. I have seen them growing on the beach there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. These pine trees like evergreen tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, evergreen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I saw some there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is grown. And that tree is very costly here in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Cashews are very costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I was going to your country at Cochin, they loaded in the ship cashews, black pepper, and lobster, big, big cases. There are many American firms. They are export business. Lobster is very favorite food in USA. Although it is rotten, still, they take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> My father used to take at least once a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lobster juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Lobster and everything, the juice... He used to eat many lobster, King lobster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's a big business. In the state of Maine, that is one of their main sources of income, lobster. Famous, Maine... That state...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They get lobster locally or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They fish. The waters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They farm them. It's become like farming. They raise them in scientific way now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like they grow chicken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. It's all scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And they sell all over America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They artificially fatten them up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For fish-eater, lobster is very favorite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. With butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here. Here in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They use with butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Butter? But it has butter, fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, but they dip in butter. That's how my... They used to serve. My father, he used to take like that. And lemon, lemon juice. Also, Prabhupāda, when I was in Dacca... I think I told you that when I was there they were willing to sign over that land to our society. It's a very nice plot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gauḍīya Matha. Gauḍīya Matha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Because no one is maintaining, and he has no followers, and, he knows, when he dies then there's nothing. So he was interested. And not only him, but his supporters were also pushing him to sign it over, and they had agreed. But then the war broke out, and I left, and I think a lot of them have been killed who were his main finance backers. He had some lawyers and doctors who were donating, but I think they have all been killed. So now he has no one. So recently some of our men have gone to Dacca for visa to come back, and he's still interested, more so now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. He survived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Long life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. He's very old. I think he's eighty, eighty-five or something. So I have to leave the country by the thirtieth 'cause my visa is finished. So I was thinking that I should go to Dacca for a few days and meet him again and see about this land and also whether we can get the society registered in Bangladesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Well, a Muslim state, but maybe he can help us. And I want to see if he's really serious or whether he... You know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was under whose control?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Tīrtha Mahārāja. But they never gave him anything. They never gave him men; they never gave him money, nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not even letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. They never even wrote him. They didn't care. And there's still a foundation. From 1948 there is a foundation there of a building which was started in 1947 or '48, and I was very surprised because the building has a frame of steel girders, not cement but steel, big steel girder. It has a frame. I think it's about a two-story building, say half the size of Māyāpura building, half the size. And the frame is still there. I asked Pañcaratna who went there if it was still there or whether it was blown away by the war. He said, "No, it is still there." So there's already a building. There's a stone wall around the property. I think it's around, maybe, about three-quarters to an acre. But it's in the heart of the city. It's in a good area, a very populated area but very nice area also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So I thought I would go there and see and then come back, get a new visa and then return and give a report.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it will be nice. That was started by my Guru Mahārāja. We have to take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Because after he goes there's nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tīrtha Mahārāja was planning to exchange that property with a Calcutta Muhammadan, that he would give him that property, and this Muhammadan would give him this property, his property. I checked it. I approached the donor, the Bali-hatti(?) <span class="Italic">zamindar,</span> that "You donated this temple and it is going to be in the hands of Muhammadan. Do you like it?" So he said, "No, I don't like it." I said, "Make it inquiry." He inquired, and he immediately wrote Tīrtha Mahārāja that "You are contemplating. This we do not approve. We are the donor." So Tīrtha Mahārāja replied him that "It is no more in the hands of the donor. I am the trustee. Whatever I like, I can do."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Ruthless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he... There was very strong correspondence, and Tīrtha Mahārāja could not dare to do it. Otherwise he arranged like that, to give the temple to a Muhammadan and accept a Calcutta property which belonged to the Muhammadan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So when he could not do that, he just left it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He had no spiritual idea. Simply he wanted to exploit the property. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So maybe we can save that place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If we can do, it will be a great service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> 'Cause still there is fifteen million Hindus in Bangladesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> When I was there, there were many doctors and lawyers, and I think all of them have been murdered. I think the only Hindus that are left are the poor people. But while I was there the teachers and the lawyers... The most prominent lawyer was Hindu. Doctors, all educated men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see the policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But they, I think annihilated all of the... Anyone who had any education... Just like that boy. He was translating your books? They shot him in front of firing squad. One boy. I printed one book there in Bengali, I think, three thousand copies: <span class="Italic">The Peace Formula</span> and <span class="Italic">Who is Crazy,</span> I think. It was about fifteen pages. They gave me some donation. Even the Gopāla... His name was Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Brahmacārī. He also gave me from his pocket. And I printed... We had it translated in Bengali, but then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, for translating. He was shot in... Not him but this other <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> young boy, very nice boy. His name was Karuṇāmayī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For translating it they did it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, for translating. They wanted to annihilate anyone who had any literary talent. That was their idea. Or anyone who had any education. So that after they left the country there wouldn't be anything. Because they knew they had to leave one day because of the revolutionary spirit. So they thought, "Let us ravage the whole country and then leave." And that's what they did. Their main attack was the university. When I was there that was their first attack 'cause that university was a very old one and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Dacca University next to Calcutta University. Just see how human beings are becoming less than ferocious animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Even one man, he was making a plaque in your name in thankfulness for preaching this <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-dharma.</span> He was making a wooden plaque, and he was a doctor of physics at the university. And one night they came in and shot him and his whole family, this man. He was very helpful to us while we were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only fault that he was making some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, his fault was that he had some education. Anyone who was doing anything... This one boy who was translating your books, he was a very educated person. He was about thirty years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hindu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Hindu. Yes. He was <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> there at the <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> He was the chief <span class="Italic">pūjārī.</span> But he joined us. We toured a few areas, and he came with us and arranged for everything. And he joined us, and he was translating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Now take this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And we printed the book. I saw it. But then the war broke out a few days after it was ready, so I had to leave all the copies there. When I go there I will try and find it. Maybe it is still there. We spent about five hundred rupees. Five, six hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Pakistan has gained by this separation? Actually they have not gained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> By the separation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Of Bangladesh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Or of India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, they haven't gained anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Karachi is finished. Nobody goes there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It's a desert. I have been there. It's horrible place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you went there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> When I came from Dacca there was only one flight a day because of the war. They could not overfly India, so there was one flight a day to Dacca to Ceylon to Karachi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, long distance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Very long flight. So I was number 15,000 on the list. Everybody camped out at the airport. Because of the war everyone wanted to leave. So there was a line of 15,000 people. They gave me my number. I was 15,000. So we waited at the airport. I said, "I can't wait here," because the bombs were dropping and the tanks were coming and the troops were coming and... I said, "I gotta get out of here." So I spoke with the commander, and I played him a tape of <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> I had a tape, and they... All the officers, they were Mussulmen from Pakistan, and they started clapping: "Oh, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>." You know. So I asked him, "Could you allow me to go on board before all the others? There's no use in us staying here. Who knows what will happen? We are foreigners." We were dressed as <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> also. So he allowed us to go on in front of everyone. So we managed to leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the condition at that time, general, during the war?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Where? In Dacca?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> There was starvation immediately. There was no food in the whole city. I was living on <span class="Italic">capatis.</span> That's all we had. Course, we were very nervous, so we couldn't eat so much anyway because there was so much going on in the city, bombings and firing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And general public?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And most of the army, they imported the army from Pakistan. These men were six feet tall. These were... They have a certain name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jatha? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Jatha? No. Rathan or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pathan. Pathan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Very huge men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So in comparison to the Bengali, they were very small. So they were very fearful of these fighters. The whole Pakistani army was made of these Pathans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pathans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Very huge men, very tall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So there was great fear in the hearts of the people 'cause they're very small. And all of the equipment was imported from America, all the tanks, the jeeps, all the planes and-all American</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why American patronize Pakistan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because... Against Russia. India is with Russia. And China... Also the Pakistanis... When I was in Pakistan, they have great love for the Chinese people. When I was there it was more than the Americans. They liked the Chinese more than the Americans. 'Cause I went to the Karachi University 'cause I thought we could start some preaching there. So I met the professor of philosophy and he had agreed that we could give some lecture, but not on Indian culture but on yoga or something. So the students there were very much... They liked the Chinese. They were always talking, "Oh, China." So China is also opposed to Russia. So in this way the sides were taken. But it's a hellish place there. It's all sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Karachi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Very hot. We used to get our fruit... There was no place where we could eat, so we used to buy fruit and nuts at the Empress Market, very big market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dacca.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, in Karachi. A very huge market. They have, very good, these grapefruits. They're very sweet there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Grapefruit. You know, like orange?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> But very sweet tasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yellowish or greenish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. They're pinkish inside, pink color. Yellow skin but pink inside and very sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Karmuja.</span> (?) And some sweet scent also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. They're very nice. We ate so many of them. (Hari-śauri preaching to someone in background:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because He's the Supreme Person. You're worshiping Indira Gandhi or in America they're worshiping Nixon or Ford. In Britain they're worshiping someone else. Everyone is worshiping someone who is better than he is. You may go to work and worship your boss because he'll give you a better pay check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is preaching. (chuckling with devotees)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I read in the paper. They're having elections in March.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Karachi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, here, here in India. They're holding election. Because of the emergency, they had banned the election.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In Bengal there'll be an election?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, all over India for the Lok Sabha, for the Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So Tarun Kanti will be up for election?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No. That's something else. This is for the Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So Indira's not being up for election.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just the Parliament members, that's all, not the ministers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Indira... She must be Parliament member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, but I don't think she's affected. I didn't read. I just saw on the man's desk. I just saw the elections to be held.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> She's from Allahabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So she's Parliament. Maybe for her also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It'll be fixed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So, Prabhupāda, I'll have to leave on the 25th from here 'cause I could only get a 28-day visa from Kathmandu. So I have to leave the country by the 30th. So I'll go to Dacca and check everything out and then return and give report, and we can decide what we should do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If we can get, we shall take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you can start a center there. That will be very good. And when they see that Americans are taking, the Muhammadans will be attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. No, I found them... They weren't so fanatic. The Bengali Mussulmans are not like the others. They're very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Well, I spoke with students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They're educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. And most of the business and industry is in the hands of the Mussulmans. But they... We walked around like this, and there was no trouble-at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got a Bengali language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Oh, yes. They speak Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they kept Bengali language-state language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So naturally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I was thinking also that Śatadhanya Mahārāja, he has learned Bengali. So I was thinking that he may also go with me because he knows Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He speaks it, and he is not so much engaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take some <span class="Italic">Gītārgān</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, I'm going to take. I was thinking if my vans get kicked out of the country because of the customs, that we would go to Bangladesh and take trunkloads of <span class="Italic">Gītārgāns</span> and go to Dacca and Chittagong and some of the big cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bangladesh. It will be great service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a few people asking for <span class="Italic">darśana</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's one boy we've been preaching to. He's a student in sociology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him come. No "logy" before Kṛṣṇa conscious. All "logy" finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Hari-śauri, I turned this off. You going to stay here, Hari-śauri? So I should take it out? Leave it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) You belong to Orissa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Bhuvaneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhuvaneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, we are coming just to have a <span class="Italic">darśana</span> from you. (Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This young man here is a student. He's studying for his MA in sociology. He has a few questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you have some question, you can ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are a student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, from the very beginning, I am attached to the society, and through these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone is social animal. "Society, friendship, and love." They say "divinely bestowed upon man." So because we are strongly in misunderstanding our identification, we take this society as divinely. But we have got the society that is not on the bodily conception. Otherwise, these European, Americans, Africans, Canadians, they would not have come together. This is a different platform. It is a society, but on the spiritual platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, may I know the meaning of the divine name Hare Kṛṣṇa and Hare Rāma? The real meaning of the divine name Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meaning is very simple. The Hare, it is addressing, <span class="Italic">sambodhana.</span> Just like we ask somebody, "Hello, Mr. such and such." It is like that, Hara. Hara is the energy of the Supreme Lord. Supreme Lord is Hari, and Hara is the energy, potency. So we are addressing <span class="Italic">hara</span>-"Hare." And "Kṛṣṇa," that is also addressing, <span class="Italic">hara,</span> Kṛṣṇa. So we are praying: "O the energy of the Lord, O Your Lordship, kindly engage us in Your service." This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So that is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is note of address: "O Kṛṣṇa and O Kṛṣṇa's energy, please engage me in Your service." Because we are in service, every one of us. What you are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, I am a government servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are servant. And any one of you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am also a servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone in servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, sir, servant is always serving in the government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are servant. So every one of us is a servant. But this service has not pleased us. Therefore we are seeking other service, the service of the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, what is the way to serve the Supreme?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Just like a servant, when he is not pleased, somehow or other, with the master, he seeks another service. Is it not? Similarly, the service in this material world will never please us, neither the master. Take for example Gandhi. He gave so much service to his country, to his countrymen, but what was the result? He was shot dead. So who can please more than Gandhi? So we should take lesson from this, that if you are engaged in rendering service to the material world, neither you'll be happy nor the master will be happy. It is simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, those who are fighting for the country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh! Any way, any way, material service is simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, actually what is spiritual service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual service-to render service to Kṛṣṇa as Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, but those who are freedom fighters, they are actually on the wrong path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Everyone who is not serving Kṛṣṇa, he is in the wrong path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But Kṛṣṇa means... Who is He? Is He a personal or impersonal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Person. Service means person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless you are person, I am person, how I can serve you or how you can accept service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Means what is God and Kṛṣṇa? Is there any difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is person. That I am saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> God is person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, like you, as you are talking with me, I am talking with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, He is not infinite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you have to understand, that although He is person, He is infinite. That you have to understand. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Sir, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">He!</span> One man. If you argue in that way, many people, then there will be no answer. You should know the etiquette. How can I answer so many person at a time? So this infinite is explained, infiniteness. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">māyā tatam idaṁ sarvam:</span> "I am infinitely everywhere." <span class="Italic">māyā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtina [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like here in this room, do you think there is no government in this room? Do you think there is no government within this room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, I think there is some government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is. But that... It is not... There is no representative of government, but still, we are under the government. This is <span class="Italic">avyakta.</span> The government is there, but it doesn't mean that the prime minister or the president is there. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, but He says, <span class="Italic">māyā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagat...</span> (end)</div>
