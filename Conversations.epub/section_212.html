<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Make it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They agree, everyone will agree. It is not a question. (laughter) First of all make the zone. Whatever I'll say, he'll agree. That is not the problem. First of all make up zone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Alright.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First of all divide the whole world. It doesn't matter who goes where but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> India, Pakistan, (indistinct discussion), Bangladesh, (indistinct) China. Then we have the Mediterranean zone.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where is Japan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> It is more north.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no what is the name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> And Korea...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What we are naming? Far east?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> One zone we'll call Japan, we'll call it far east.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, China is nearer to Japan. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Well it's very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> China is very big. It could be even more because it touches...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> China is big, but we have no center (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So Hong Kong under which zone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Well, it's very close to Manila and Manila is in part of Southeast Asia, Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So Hong Kong is already zone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct-devotees entering and exiting room)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Previously Hong Kong was part of Southeast Asia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Still. We linked China with Hong Kong and put it with Southeast Asia. Peking, Peking is much closer to Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Divide the whole world into twelve parts. That is first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct-devotees converse in background for some time on map and countries)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Africa is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes. (indistinct-more background discussion on map and countries)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Gradually this GBC, they can take assistants to help them. (indistinct) One change, Toronto, just see (indistinct) not be necessary. Take care (indistinct-more background discussion on map and countries).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Twelve zones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Twelve zones means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotees:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Whole world? Let me see. (reading) Southeast Asia, Australia, Japan, Korea, (indistinct), India, Central Asia, Mediterranean, Germany, Africa, South America, British Isles, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Western Europe, (indistinct). So now you have to specifically mention Mediterranean means this. Similarly, all these center(?) should be specifically mentioned this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> I was waiting till Śyāmasundara Prabhu came back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now so far division made by (indistinct), we are present. I'll represent him, that's all. And who else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Sudāmā Maharaja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh? That was I'll represent. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Gaurasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Gaurasundara. He has been already agreed. Girirāja also. Those who are absent, I've written them. Now, so far Hayagrīva Prabhu is concerned, he has resigned from this. And he'll concentrate on editorial work. And Kīrtanānanda will become the president of New Vrindaban. So, that question is solved. Now, how the New Vrindaban will be managed, that we shall decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> We talked about that this morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So Hayagriva Prabhu is exit from GBC. And now others? Sudāmā is there. So one exit and one new one, Girirāja is there. And, how many of you are now existing actually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> There is seven here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Seven here, eight here including Śyāmasundara. So who are those four? One Sudāmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> He is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah. Hamsaduta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Madhuvisa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Madhuvisa is new, from the old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rūpānuga:</b> Kṛṣṇa Dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh? So he is out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tamal Kṛṣṇa is out. Kṛṣṇa Dāsa is out. Hayagrīva is out. So out of twelve, three out. So who are the nine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Sudāmā and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eight present here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Haṁsaduta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rūpānuga:</b> Seven present including Hayagrīva. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> There's eight present and Hayagrīva's out so that makes seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are three and three, six and seven. Oh, seven. So seven, Hayagrīva and present, eight, and three out. So who is the next nine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Haṁsaduta and Sudāmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, Sudāmā. That is alright. Then, alright. Now three out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They are Hayagrīva Prabhu and Kṛṣṇa Dāsa Prabhu. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. So out of the three we are adding Brahmānanda, Girirāja and Madhudviṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> What about Gaurasundara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct) America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, Gaurasundara. So, Girirāja, Brahmānanda and Madhudviṣa we want to maintain. Then... (door opens and closes) Three candidates, four, new?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rūpānuga:</b> Because originally Bali-mardana had a zone but now he's with ISKCON Press so actually he doesn't have a zone any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh. He has... So you are also out. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> It's really a difficult problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah, no problem. GBC means now they should tour very extensive. That is the first principle, the GBC. Not sit down (in) one place and pass resolution. No, they must be active. They must act like me. As I am old man, I am traveling all over the world. Now to give me relief, the GBC members... I shall expand into twelve more so that they can exactly work like me. Gradually they will be initiators. At least first initiation. You must make advance. That is my motive. So, in that way I want to divide it in twelve zones. And we have to make more propaganda throughout the whole world. Now if you think that the world is so big, twelve members are insufficient, then you can increase more than that and make the zone similarly divided. It is world affair after all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Srila Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> The reason why we have thirteen here is because Bali-mardana, he is actually at the Press, he doesn't actually have a zone at this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> So Madhudviṣa is taking my zone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> So only keep thirteen GBC at this point? Will Bali-mardana stay at the Press and be considered GBC?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But, he is not going to travel, Bali-mardana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Unless he can find a substitute to manage the Press. (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First point is the GBC member must be extensively traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> What about my position, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, everyone's position will be considered. This is the first thing, extensively traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> So, the positions of Bali-mardana and Karandhara, they have to remain stationary so much. We have to consider that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, stationary one thing is that the Bali-mardana, especially Karandhara, he has got already extensive field locally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He has to manage so many things. So extensively touring means for the mission expanding, that is the point. Simply touring is not required, but doing something substantial to increase the interest of the society. That is the point. So, Karandhara has got many department supervisors(?), so he can be given to work, and sometimes go away (indistinct). So, his position is like that. And similarly Bali-mardana's position is there. He can be also if he has got many engagements, many departments managed there. So he may not tour but our only aim is that one must take multi-responsibilities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Why not Bali-mardana tour sometimes to check on the foreign literatures, French, German, see how they are going on and inspect the foreign literature field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct) planning to take speaking engagements in the colleges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotees:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So we shall increase. You can increase the number. So according to vacant position, how many, it may be fifteen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Thirteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why not fifteen, make fifteen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> We are thinking of (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> We are thinking of (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Or anyone, you can do. Then you have to reorganize the zones, fifteen zones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Rūpānuga:</b> This is much better if we're actually expanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, we must expand, we must expand. Now the framework of expansion is done by me, but this, they should be solidified. Just like your skyscraper building. The framework is done then they are made nicely air-conditioned and covered by glass (indistinct). It makes a nice house. Similarly, so far the framework is done. I have done with your help. Now we have to push this movement. It is very important movement. It is not a farce. It is actually for the benefit of the human society. They are kept in darkness about God. And we are delivering God, "Here is God." So that must be pushed. What is your opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya!</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They are kept in darkness about God. Somebody is speaking, saying "God is dead." Some is (saying), "God is impersonal. There is not God. I am God, you are God," all this nonsense. Here is God. We have to push this. What do you think, Hayagrīva Prabhu? So, Hayagrīva Prabhu is taking charge of pushing this movement by help in editorial work. So that is most important because we are distributing books. Our writing will be gospel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We have to edit in such a way, present our literature in such a way that it will be gospel truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Authorized. That people will refer to our books. So we have to very cautiously print our literatures. It is not ordinary literature, fiction, or something, story. Just like <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> and <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata.</i> They are not ordinary. literature. Without any four defects of human frailties. <i class="calibre3">Bhrama, pramāda, vipralipsa</i>, also... We are following those literatures. So our writing should be so authorized that in future one may not find any fault, contradiction. We shall have to, cautiously. The ideas are given there now... In future of course, it requires that we shall increase (indistinct). But for the present, we have to push on this movement with positive, I mean to say, conviction, that here is God. God is neither dead, nor every one of you is God, nor is He imperson. God is a person and we give you His name, address, father's name, activities. Here is God. So, we have to (indistinct). So if you have got any doubt about it, then you cannot do it. If you have got any doubt that whether Kṛṣṇa is positive God or (indistinct) then you cannot do it. That is the first qualification. If you are yourself not convinced, how you can convince others? This is our propaganda. This is our mission. (indistinct). Whether you are all convinced on this point? That here is positive God. What is your opinion? So far I am concerned, I have no opinion, convinced. (laughter). Therefore, I am pushing on. It is a fact. I am pushing on because I am pushing on fact, not fiction. That much I am personally convinced. Whenever there is somebody says, "You believe". "No, I don't believe, it is fact." Any press reporter, that press reporter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is not the question I believe and don't believe, it is a fact. God is there-you believe or not believe-but God must be there. Your believing, not believing, it doesn't matter. If I don't believe there is no president, it does not mean there will be no president. There must be president. I do not know who is president. (indistinct) So people are in misconception that there is no God, God is dead, I am God, you are God, God is not person, so many God theories. But we have no theory, we have got a positive presentation, "Here is God." With that conviction we have to push on. So you must be prepared in that way. There will be so many questions, so many opposing elements. You have to face them by your arguments, by your knowledge. This is required. At least we must have faith in that way. We have to push on. This is the fact. We are Brahmā <i class="calibre3">sampradāya</i>, Lord Brahmā's <i class="calibre3">sampradāya</i>. So, Brahmā <i class="calibre3">sampradāya,</i> Lord Brahmā is giving. Just like last evening we were reading about Brahmā's thought. He is posing, "Yes, here is, You are God." Although He was child, "He appears to be a child, but You are God." That is Brahmā (indistinct). He is giving support on that point. So if you follow Brahmā then there is no question, here is God. And he writes in his <i class="calibre3">saṁhitā,</i></div>
<div class="Verse">isvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sat-cid-ānanda vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Here is the God. And Kṛṣṇa says, <i class="calibre3">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 10.8]<i class="calibre3">. Mattaḥ parataraṁ nasti. </i>(indistinct). "There is no more superior truth than Me, I am the origin of everthing." <i class="calibre3">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</i> Everything comes from Him. The <i class="calibre3">Vedānta</i> says, <i class="calibre3">janmādy asya yataḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.1.1]<i class="calibre3">,</i> so Absolute Truth is there, which is the original source of everything." So, Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the original source of everything." The <i class="calibre3">Vedānta</i> says the Absolute Truth means the original source of everything. Brahmā confirms it and you must also understand (indistinct). So you must spread your conviction by your literature, by your argument, by your preaching, by facing opposing elements. That is the process. What do you think, Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Kīrtanānanda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is the point. Our advancement means the more we meet opposing elements, "Oh, that is alright." Therefore preacher is the best devotee because he is a soldier. Just like government gives all importance to the fighting soldier. When there is war, all comforts for the soldier first, then the civil people. There was no butter in Germany, there was no butter. But the soldiers were profusely supplied with butter. And sometimes when the enemy attacks, they throw it away and go away and go to another shelter and still there is butter. That my Godbrother (indistinct) when he first came to India I asked him that, "I heard that you German people are very robust, stout and strong, why you are so thin and weak?" So he replied me in this way that, "In my childhood when I was eight years old weekly I was getting butter for (indistinct)". Everything was controlled, even for children. But the soldiers, there was no control. So that is, my point is, that those who are soldiers, fighting on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, they are brave soldiers. <i class="calibre3">Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</i> [Bg. 18.69]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Kṛṣṇa says, "Nobody is dearer than him who is in the process of preaching this <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā.</i>" So, in order to become very dear to Kṛṣṇa... Actually that is the position. So we must preach in that way-by our literature, by our magazine, by our books, by our speech, by our arrangements. Of course, very peacefully, we are not very (indistinct), becoming violent (indistinct). But by argument, by words, by our methods, by our preaching, we have to convince. So selected fifteen men, not twelve (indistinct). It may increase more. Now we have got very many centers, but the duty is very responsible. So as, so far the center is concerned, the local president is (indistinct) man. The GBC can supervise that things are going on. The first management is that each and every member in the temple is chanting sixteen rounds regularly and following the regulations, that's all. Otherwise we have no... That is our spiritual strength. That must be executed. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, such exalted personality, such advanced, still he is numerical counting even up to the point of his death. Therefore he was given the <i class="calibre3">nāmācārya,</i> because so rigid (indistinct). Even at the time of his death, Lord Caitanya requested, "Now you can minimize." "No sir, I cannot minimize." And what is the number? 300,000. These are the examples. (indistinct ) Sometimes... But the regulation is that if one day you cannot finish, you have to finish on the next day. But sixteen rounds is not very large number, the lowest. The lowest in India is twenty-five(?). Here sixteen rounds, twenty-five, not even twenty-five. So the president, local president, must see that the members are chanting. So this way the institution will be managed, then it will make progress. That is our spiritual strength-to observe the regulative principles and at least chant sixteen rounds. Then you do other things. This is the biggest institution of spiritual activities so everyone of us should be spiritually strong. Otherwise, superficially if we want to manage, it will not be possible. (indistinct).</div>

<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanam,</i> favorably. Otherwise, it will go to the category of <i class="calibre3">anyābhilāṣitā</i>, material desire-<i class="calibre3">jñāna, karma</i>, yoga, (indistinct). And <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> is so pure that it has nothing to do with material activities or speculative, or mystic yoga, it has nothing to do. Just like <i class="calibre3">gopīs. Anyā...</i> They had nothing to do with all this nonsense, <i class="calibre3">karma, jñāna, yoga.</i> They are neither yogīs, nor very learned scholar, Vedāntist<i class="calibre3">,</i> nor very good businessmen, economist, simple boys and girls. But <i class="calibre3">their</i> devotion is exalted. Because they did not know anything beyond Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is their love(?). Never mind to know that Kṛṣṇa is God or not, it doesn't matter. Then they don't, they didn't care for God also. <i class="calibre3">Gopīs</i>, when they say Nārāyaṇa, "Oh, He's Nārāyaṇa." (laughter) (indistinct) Nārāyaṇa, they have nothing to do with Him. They are searching after Kṛṣṇa and when Kṛṣṇa presented Himself as Nārāyaṇa, four-handed, they neglected. And before Rādhārāṇī, He could not remain as Nārāyaṇa. Automatically He handed (indistinct). (laughter) Hands are folded. So our idea is Vṛndāvana. So our love for Kṛṣṇa should be so strong that we don't care for anything. But for preaching if somebody challenges, yes, we are prepared to talk. That is authority. That is <i class="calibre3">uttama-adhikārī.</i> His love is Kṛṣṇa, enormous, but not sentiment. If anyone wants to talk with him, "Yes, come on," That is <i class="calibre3">uttama-adhikārī, mahā-bhāgavata.</i> So this is the position. Now something is in your hand-Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That was my plan that I shall carry this baggage and give it to the Americans and they will distribute. That was my plan, therefore I came to America. So now you are so many boys, young boys, you have understood. So do it and give me relief. I remain in the background. Let me finish my <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata Purāṇa</i> and those who are assisting in the writing, I'll be there (indistinct). That this institution, ISKCON will give to the world so many valuable jewels. There is no comparison. That you will have to see, (indistinct). Already they are appreciating on account of (indistinct). The paper, what is that paper...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Sun Times?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Los Angeles Times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Maybe. They are not (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They are serious. They have got, they have got (indistinct). Our seriousness will be proved when our books and (indistinct) around thinking men, scholars. Similarly, we should introduce our (indistinct) colleges and universities. This is our program. So I have got my program now, (indistinct). So so far, Vṛndāvana question is concerned, there is, it is solved. Now you make, utilize, and place yourself in the world (indistinct) I want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> There are two more GBC appointments that have been made, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, they are already. Now extra. Now we are increasing to fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Practically, there is not much... To divide Europe into another zone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, for the time being you can do it like that. So three has already entered and three has already gone. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa has gone, Hayagrīva has gone, and Kṛṣṇa Dāsa has gone. And we are introducing three: Brahmānanda, Girirāja, and Madhudviṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotees:</b> Gaurasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Gaurasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> So shall we keep the number at thirteen, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Make it, make it (maybe?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Thirteen is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Or you can make it out to fifteen, I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Your Guru Mahārāja wanted twelve originally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He wanted, but he was manage Gauḍīya Maṭha. We are managing the whole world. Guru Mahārāja (indistinct) less intelligent than (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> We can divide it up into smaller and smaller parts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What you do now, this is my manifest plan, you... And so far Vṛndāvana is concerned, now there are three properties, so ideally one should keep (give?) his own property. Is that all right? (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> That leased property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Leased property. So I am not concerned. (indistinct) I want that you should live very peacefully and concentrate your mind for (indistinct). And we are not disturbed with these arrangements. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja will be (indistinct), then that problem is solved. Now you make divided zones and work (indistinct). I want to (indistinct). That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Do you want us to make more zones now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You make ourself. Because thirteen, you are making now thirteen. You make thirteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> No, actually there's twelve, and Bali-mardana is staying at the press and he is going to travel around. We want to increase and make more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right, that's all right. Bali-mardana will be stagnant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> He can oversee some foreign...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, he has this book department. Book department and... They may move according to convenience, Bali-mardana and Karandhara. He has got also very responsibility, with this department, that department. He has to purchase small houses. So big brain (indistinct). So similarly, you also think on the books. Everyone take big responsibility. Then we have to serve this mission. The people are foolish, they have forgotten God. We are delivering them. Best service. And without God, it is all useless, zero, all this civilization. Zero. Whatever they are making advancement, it is all zero. And nonsense. But actually it is. Now the priestly order supporting homosex. I was surprised. They are going to pass resolution for getting married between man to man. The human society has come down to such a degraded position. It is astonishing. When I heard from Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja there is a big conference for passing this resolution. In India still, if there somebody hears about homosex (makes sound of breathing out). Homosex is there but nobody will support publicly. (indistinct) People are going down and this is the subject matter for priestly order? It may be subject matter for the legislator, priestly order, they are discussing for one week. Just imagine. <i class="calibre3">Phalena paricīyate</i>, one has to study by the result. Not that superficially you show that "We are very much advanced." <i class="calibre3">Phalena</i>, what is the result? <i class="calibre3">Phalena paricīyate,</i> your, that is in English word also, end justifies the means. The end is this (indistinct) "We are going to support homosex." Getting married. There are many cases the priestly order has actually got married. I read it in that paper, <i class="calibre3">Watch</i>, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotees:</b> <i class="calibre3">Watchtower</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Watchtower</i>. They have complained(?). So we have nothing to (indistinct) them. The world is degrading to the lowest status, even less than animal. The animal also do not support homosex. They have never sex life between male to male. They are less than animal. People are becoming less than animal. This is all due to godlessness. <i class="calibre3">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā</i> [SB 5.18.12], godless civilization cannot have any good qualities. <i class="calibre3">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano rathena asato dhāvato...</i> They simply go to the untruth by mental speculation.
