<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Monsieur Mesman is the chief of the law-house of Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Law-house means legislative assembly? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It is part of the National Assembly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Mesman:</span> Yes. It is in the National Assembly. It is National... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we have in our country, "Legislative Assembly".</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Mesman:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, like that. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they're not necessarily lawyers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Mesman:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are also lawyer. Not in the material sense. But we know what is the law of God. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He asks, "What are our activities in France?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing: to induce people to become lawful to the laws of God. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks what are we doing for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> What ways are we doing that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> In which way, what way, how?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, we are chanting the holy name of Lord so that people may hear and their hearts be cleansed to understand what is God. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> This gentleman asks if the disciples have to give up their religion, if, for example, they are Christian, they have to give up Christianity to be devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Christianity also, they are trying to understand God, and we are also trying to understand, not only understand, but we, we are trying others to understand what is God. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks if we have temple in France or if we do in apartment or if we do in conference, private conferences. How we are doing it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway. We welcome all, all learned men, or leading men, to understand this philosophy. And the book is... You show <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And all other books also show him. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, unfortunately, he doesn't read English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is French. French language. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have practical political philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He asks what are our political principles in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Do we have a program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our... We have not only political program, but we have got political, and economical, intellectual, and ordinary. We think... Just like in your body, there are four divisions: the head, the arms, the belly and the leg. So this is complete. Head is the most important division. If you cut your head, then everything finished. Therefore head must be there. Head means first-class intelligent men. And their qualification is stated... Find out, <span class="Italic">śamo damas titikṣā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You want to translate? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there must be four divisions of the society, the first-class men, the second-class men, the third-class men and the rest, fourth-class. The first-class men should be self-restrained, control over the senses... Hmmm. Read. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-karma svabhāva-jam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.42]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is definition of the first-class man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Do you want me to translate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With all these qualifications, one can become first-class man. They should be the directors, or the brain of the society. The next class...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> (correcting translator): "These people should be..." Prabhupāda said: "These people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> (corrects translation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A class of men, first-class men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says "We say, 'They should be,' " which indicates that perhaps now we do not have that situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Practically none. That is the defect of the modern society, that there is no brain. Therefore the whole world is in chaotic condition. In your country also, it is famous for so many revolutions. And whole Europe is..., Russia and other countries, because there is no brain. So there is need of these qualified first-class men, to lead the human society. Then next class... The head is first class, and next class: arms, protector, administrator. Their qualification is stated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Nitāi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Teja...</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> It's uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tejas.</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> <span class="Italic">Śauryam,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śauryaṁ tejo dhṛtir dākṣyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam<br class="calibre2"/>dānam īśvara-bhāvaś ca<br class="calibre2"/>kṣātraṁ karma svabhāva-jam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.43]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity and leadership are the qualities of work for the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next class, the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas. Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam<br class="calibre2"/>paricaryātmakaṁ karma<br class="calibre2"/>śūdrasyāpi svabhāva-jam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.44]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Farming, cattle-raising and business are the qualities of the work for the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> and for the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> there is labor and service to others."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the present moment, the people in general, they are engaged in service, in factories, in big, big office, big, big establishment. So they're all <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> fourth-class men. And the fourth-class men select their representative. So they must be also fourth-class. Democracy means selected, I mean to..., voted, elected. So because they are being elected by the fourth-class men, the leaders are also fourth-class men. The fourth-class men cannot appreciate the first-class men. And there is lacking of second-class men. So the result is that at the present moment, the whole world is being managed by the fourth-class men. Therefore, there are so many anomalies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He says this concept is against the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "Traditional western capitalism..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> The traditional western capitalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It is against capitalism, this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is the movement to qualify men to their respective positions. It is an educational system to divide first-class, second-class, third-class, fourth-class. They all required, but at the present moment, the fourth-class man is occupying the first-class man's place. We want to divide the society into real first-class, second-class, third-class... They're all required, but they have got their respective positions, not topsy-turvied. As the, as to keep the body fit, we require the head, the hands, the belly and the legs. If we simply keep legs, it is useless. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks what language we use when we read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is in Sanskrit language, but we translate into different languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Mesman:</span> English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> English, French, German, Spanish, and other languages. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks if we have to be disciple, do we have to know Sanskrit or to learn Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. Because it is published in other languages. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks how many disciples there is in France?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Tell him there's hundred devotees, but there's hundreds who come to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dedicated devotee, hundred. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If one is a full-time disciple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's dedicated disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Does that mean he must give up his family, and come and live here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he can live with his family. It is to take up the cause, not to give up the family. We don't believe in giving up. We believe in engaging them properly. That is our philosophy. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks if the hundreds devotee are all in Paris or they are a little bit everywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Explain there's travelling parties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, we're centered in Paris, and they travel all over France. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks if we have a school in France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got a school in Dallas, America, but we are trying to open a school here, also. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This school is for all ages or just for children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, all ages. Children means they learn Sanskrit and English. And they are taught our books. You show our books, all books. These are... Other books. We have got eighty books like this. So if a student reads all these eighty books, he becomes Doctor of Philosophy. Ph.D. Beginning from A,B,C,D, up to Ph.D., all, everything is there. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He asks if you wrote all these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Did you write all these books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can say. What can I...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, our spiritual master has translated these books. (French) He asks, "These are the ancient Sanskrit books then?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Prabhupāda has not just translated. He's given commentary, purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can show the nature, translation, word-meaning. (French) Then I combine with reference to the modern society, how they can be applicable to the modern life. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Have we interested any of the leading French citizens in our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know, but many French men came to see me, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Last year, at Hotel De Ville.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Last year, you were received by the Mayor at Hotel De Ville.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but in America we have reception from highly scholarly people, university heads, like that. Our books are being read in universities, colleges, and they're accepted in big, big libraries. Not only accepted what is published, but they have forward order for all the publications that will come. Yes? Hmmm. (someone comes in with a plate of <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> (explains about <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have learned this preparation, these girls. We have taught them. We are strictly vegetarian. From grains, from milk and sugar, and just two three, things, we require, and we can prepare thousands of preparations out of that. From milk and grains and sugar... And? What else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> Fruit, vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fruits, vegetable, we can prepare thousands of preparations, very palatable. Some of them you can taste. Yes, take. Whatever you like, take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Maybe you can also explain that this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this preparation, explain. You explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is <span class="Italic">burfi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> : This is cake, cookie.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not cookie. It is <span class="Italic">burfi</span> like... What is this made of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> This is <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span> It is milk preparation. Give him one more. No, no. This <span class="Italic">sandeśa,</span> you give him one more. So our recommendation is, "Don't kill cow." Take milk and make thousands of preparations, all nutritious and very healthy. They do not know how to use cow. Instead of killing, if we take, let the animal live and give us milk, and from the milk, we make hundreds of preparations. The milk is nothing but blood, transformation of blood. So we take the blood by killing the animal, but we do not wish to kill such an important animal, but they take the blood in form of milk and make preparation. And those who are flesh-eaters, let them wait for the death of the cow. Then let them eat the flesh, not living condition. So we are making preparation that keep the cows, protect the cows, and when the cow dies, the flesh-eater may take it away. So he can take the skin, he can take the hoof, he can take the horn, he can take the flesh, everything, whatever he likes. Because when it is dead, it is no more useful for us. So the others, who are interested with the skin, in the flesh, in the hoof, they can take it. And they get it free. Without any cost. Because after death, we don't want it. So this is our program. Let the cows live. We take sufficient milk. We are getting milk, one thousand pounds. One thousand pounds daily in our, one center, New Vrindaban, Virginia. So we are making various preparations from the milk, and they are very happy, and the cows are also happy. So this is one of our programs, to stop killing this important animal. And the flesh-eaters may wait a little until the cow dies. Then he gets the opportunity. Why there should be slaughterhouse maintained? As you are one of the leading citizens of Paris, we appeal to you to take up this consideration seriously. Why we should maintain slaughterhouse? If we want to eat the flesh, let us wait till the death. And there will be death. There is no doubt about it. So why they should maintain slaughterhouse? And this is most cruelty. A animal which is giving milk, so important foodstuff, and that is being killed, it does not suit any moral sense of any human being. On the contrary, according to Vedic system, there are seven mothers. And cow is accepted one of them. Because she gives milk, and we take her milk, therefore she's our mother. So this is our philosophy. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> He says there is a French...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> A French saying that says, "We don't have to kill the cow's milk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The cow who gives milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> The cow who gives milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> One should not kill... That's a French saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That one should not kill the cow that gives milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Very good philosophy. Why don't you follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's a proverb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> Proverb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Proverb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So put into action this proverb. So that is... You are one of the leading mayor. That is our appeal. What is unreasonableness in our proposal that so long the cow lives...? Cow, every cow gives milk. So it fulfills your proverb also. So under the circumstances, let the cows live peacefully, take milk and make this preparation of cow's milk, and when it is dead, free of charges. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he will try to take to heart what you have told him today, and he thanks you for having received him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So kindly do this service. Kṛṣṇa will bless you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Mesman:</span> Thank you. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
