<div class="Heading">Letter to Russian<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>January 5, 1977, Bombay</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, of course if the Russians...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can reprint this for distribution here, Russian ships.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The only danger to this will be that if the Russian government finds out that we are translating Russian literature, because hearing "propaganda,"-this is what the Christians do-then they will crack down very hard on our disciples there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is my disciple there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, only a few you have, Ananta-śānti. And they won't let us go there at all in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't mean we shall not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then they will think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll think. It is. Why shall I not do it? All thinking actually. We must do it. So where is that card? Bring it. I shall dictate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That card?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your card is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's on my side. You don't want the card, do you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. He wants to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is addressed to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I'll show it to you. It just says, "Happy New Year." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Still, we have to reply them with this copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay, very good. So I should take a dictation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has signed that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's from Mr. Yekinow. I had met him in Moscow. He's now in Delhi with the Russian</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is a chief of the Russian agency that imports books into Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, so address him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. "Dear Mr. Yekinow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it has come from Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give the Delhi address, embassy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I have told them that we don't have any Bhaktivedanta Book Trust offices in Bombay because I did not want them to visit our... I told them our Bhaktivedanta Book Trust office is in Bombay, because then he would have said, "I'll come and visit you in your office" and then he would have come to the temple. So we don't want to show any connection with ISKCON for Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because then they'll find out it's religion and they will stop it at once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as he reads the book, he will find, according to them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, what I told the Russians was that ISKCON buys all the books from Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just keep that position. What is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I mean we have to keep it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we have got pictures of God, and with every page there is Kṛṣṇa, and how you can hide it? That is another foolishness. Every page, there is Kṛṣṇa, and there is nothing but Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But by the time they find out, we are already in the country. For example, if I would have told them about ISKCON before, when I was applying for my visa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no... Anyway they may find, early or later, but how you can stop them finding? It is simply impossible.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Anyway, they expect that something coming from India is going to have something to do with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are saying... What I said is Bhaktivedanta Book Trust is dedicated to publishing books on ancient Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say like that... Whatever you like, you can say, but when they read the book it is simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa. That's all. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but the scholars, the Russian scholars, know... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have published their photograph in the paper. They take it, whatever... But the things are already there. So "Dear Mr. such and such, I thank you very much for your greetings card received recently. This cultural movement is depending in future on Russian intelligence and Indian culture. On this cultural movement, recently our Stockholm center has published one book..." What it is written here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Russian language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "<span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets.</span> So this is a different culture, how to go to other planetary system, how to transfer the soul from one body to another. In other planets there are also living entities. One can transfer himself, after giving up this body, to anywhere he likes without any help of the sputnik, and without the help of the sputnik or any flying machine. This is the mystic system unknown to the world, but it is authorized in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> original culture of the human civilization."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's on the tape. I'm recording it too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, "A preliminary booklet is presented herewith to your good self. Kindly read it carefully and let me know your reaction. We are prepared to answer all intricate questions in this subject." In this way present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fine. I have made a lot of friends in Russia. I was going to send them. Only problem... Actually, I'll tell you what's happening with my correspondence with Russia. The Russian spying agency is so strong, they're not letting my letters get through, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't send. What is the use of sending?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Actually what I was thinking of was, in my letters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all see one man. Test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was going to mention to him in my letter that I'm surprised how I'm not getting replies to my letters from the people I visited in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why you should inquire from him? If you know that there is difficulty, why should you inquire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he can then have his Moscow address office get me the replies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why you are anxious to get their reply? Their country is like that. Why...? Yes. Why should you bother and strain your brain unnecessarily? You should know they are all rascals. That's all. But here we get an opportunity. You can write, present it to... Where is the other book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. So I can take one. And I can order some more from Stockholm and send them to these people as gift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, they can send directly. They can write under instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. That's okay. I got a letter from Rajiv Gupta today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I read that letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I told him to do the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> because he was very, very anxious, and I found that he was the most enthusiastic. So he's already completed... He promises me by February it will be completed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he's enthusiastic, let him do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He knew that we gave to Dr. Poliwal so he said, "I will do it. Don't let her do it." So at the present moment three people are doing the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> There's another professor in Lucknow who I told to do also. We don't know whose will be perfect. But I think Rajiv is most enthusiastic to do it. I think Poliwal's will be little slow. And then we can see whose Hindi was the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you do not know very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I was going to present it to some scholar and then to you. This man I brought today, that assistant editor, I think he will help. I can gradually give him work, and he's in Bombay. His Hindi is very good. He's assistant editor, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you do that. Get the help of composition and monotype.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. This is the biggest... <span class="Italic">The Teachings of Lord Caitanya</span> I gave for composing four months ago, and still they're going so slow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The hand set-up is not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but in Delhi I could not find any. The only one in Delhi who has mono is <span class="Italic">Times of India,</span> and it's very difficult to get it done. So I had no alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta there are many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I found out that in Allahabad there are a lot for Hindi. But then we had to have somebody over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, one devotee or someone who will supervise that. I suspect Bombay will be much more expensive, but I want to check. Tomorrow I'll check it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Allahabad, we are going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But right now is Kumbhamela in Allahabad, everything's going to be in so much rush, it's going to be hard to do any business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, businessmen are there all right. I was doing that business. So in my shop they..., visitors used to come there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That shop. (pause) Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning Rāmeśvara Mahārāja and Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja spoke to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have heard that. That's good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's good idea? So Hṛdayānanda Swami and Kīrtanānanda Swami are going to Africa. And on the 9th they told me to send a telegram signed by you saying you are sick and you want Brahmānanda to come immediately. So then Kīrtanānanda Swami will personally bring Brahmānanda Swami to India. But they want him to become your permanent secretary again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have no objection. Okay. And Hṛdayānanda Swami is ready to manage Africa till the festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was experienced, Brahmānanda, in Africa. Where is that Cyavana? He is gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cyavana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He is a big mess.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cyavana? Cyavana Swami? [break] I think they're going to have war in Africa pretty soon. They're going to have war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> War. Civil war?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, between... Not where Kenya is but between Rhodesia and Zambia, in that area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Whites and blacks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is inevitable. The whites cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rhodesia has rejected...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...cannot kill them, repress any more. That is not possible. The other blacks will join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And it appears that even President Carter of America is more soft on the blacks now. He is more sympathetic. So if they get American support...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays you cannot be a suppressor of any particular foreigner. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Except the religious community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will suffer, both of them, because this is not civilization. This is assembly of dogs. So there trouble must be there. You cannot keep the dogs peaceful. That is my final... If you keep them animals, how you can expect...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's not only between nation to nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Everywhere. If the men are kept as animals, you cannot expect them peaceful citizens. That is not possible. The fighting will go on on one plea or another. You cannot stop. (pause) Was it...? You give...? Pālikā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mahārāja got the income tax today. The income tax also... And our auditor... Their interpretation of the law is so rigid, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We have to say so many lies. For example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you may not bother about, for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can make <span class="Italic">idli</span>? What is called? Is it called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Tonight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> No. Because I have to grind... It has to soak, then I have to grind it. Then it has to sit for six or eight hours. I can prepare it now for tomorrow night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, for tomorrow night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Anything else you would like tonight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I wanted to take that <span class="Italic">idli,</span> one or two cakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Prabhupāda, I can go to Santa Cruz and get you very nice <span class="Italic">idlis.</span> They have a very nice Madras cafe there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think some of our men, they make. Mr. Mennon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, his wife is sick. So I don't know if he would make it right away. You want to eat it right away, tonight, isn't it? There's a nice Madras cafe near Santa Cruz station on Willard Furrough.(?) I can go and get you from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can get, bring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Should I bring that coconut chutney also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is essential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. I'll bring about six or eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can bring. I'll take, utmost, one or two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. I'll go and bring it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have decided to construct a temple in Bhuvaneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have? Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The condition is that I'll invest money for Oriya language books, and you'll sell-half the collection for temple, and half the collection for printing again, the same principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They won't be able to collect one <span class="Italic">crore</span> by selling books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if they can, I have no objection. I can give them ten <span class="Italic">crores.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they'll never be able to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you cannot say. It is all in the hands of Kṛṣṇa. Not one <span class="Italic">crore.</span> Say a few <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> He's ready to go town to town, village, in Orissa. He wants that in my absence somebody must be there to look after the construction. That is quite reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have told them "Any amount I can invest. You print book and sell." That is my open secret. Print books, and distribute, and spend half in whichever life you do and half, again print books. That is my ambition (vision?). I want to see our philosophy is widely spread by different literatures. That I want to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That will be very good. There are a few people here, like Vijeta, who is Saurabha's assistant, he could probably go to Bhuvaneśvara and supervise the construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So arrange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are too many people here. We don't need that many in Bombay for the Bombay construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him come to Bhuvaneśvara. I am going after Kumbhamela. And begin the work immediately. We have got one gentleman, professor. He is good learned scholar. I can engage him for translating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oriya. Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has writing... That machine... I can see the manuscript. In this way, arrangement make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good. We just printed two books in Oriya, <span class="Italic">Topmost Yoga</span> and one more. One more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He likes Oriya language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who? Gaura-Govinda Swami? He is very sincere devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, undoubtedly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa sent him. He... In Vṛndāvana, he said that "Please give me shelter." I thought that "There are so many Indian comes and go." So when he insisted, "All right, you stay."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah. He took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> at the opening of the temple. I remember that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's stuck it out for a long time in Orissa. He's been there a long time, by himself a lot of the time too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. He's organizing nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's very sincere. He follows all the regulations very rigidly. He gets up in the morning, ideal example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He understands the philosophy quite well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. And he is educated. He is B.Sc. He knows Hindi also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He worked on Hindi translation for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that Hindi typewriter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I never saw that typewriter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask Yaśodānandana, Yaśomatī-nandana, immediately. You ask him for my <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa...</span> Yes. So very steadily do everything. Opposition will come. We have to face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I'll arrange for your <span class="Italic">idlis,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Idlis</span> and if <span class="Italic">dosa... Dosa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. There's two types of <span class="Italic">dosas.</span> One is <span class="Italic">masalā;</span> one is <span class="Italic">sada. Masalā</span> has got potatoes inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Potatoes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, inside. What they do is... Inside it's like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one is better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sada</span> is without.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sada?</span> Or I'll get <span class="Italic">masalā</span> if there are no onions in it. Sometimes they put onions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If there's no onions, I'll get one <span class="Italic">masalā</span> also. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Except in few provinces, everyone eats onion, all over the world. And garlic. In Western countries I think onion and garlic, cent percent they eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not so much garlic but onion anyway. Onions they love, big ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Sell books and this principle follow: half construct temple, half print books. That's it. No income tax. "We have spent everything. That's all." (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) In Vṛndāvana, he was suggesting, that Set, Setterji, that "You make some will. Otherwise, after your... In your absence the government will..." And I'll not keep a single farthing. I shall spend all before I die. (chuckles) Invest in book, that's all. I am insisting on this. But I am simply afraid if we have got enough stock, it may not be stolen and misused. Otherwise I want to immediately invest in books all the money that I have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't think there'll be any problem there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So arrange like that. We want. Then I'll print all books, keep in stock. Never mind. Why use the bank?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rāmeśvara's coming soon. I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Keep in stock. It will be sold. There is no doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And now we have so many different languages coming out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And here, if we make closet or on the wall. We can keep anywhere, all the verandas, all these rooms, four walls, keeping books, book stock. Make vigorous propaganda by advertising, "Read Hare Kṛṣṇa literature. Hare Kṛṣṇa is wonderful." In this way advertise. Hindi, English, Bengali. I can give suggestion; you do it. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... We are getting paper now, government paper. Money is there. Now we have to print very intelligently, and even it is not immediately sold, we can keep stock. (pause) [break] "Cultivate seriously spiritual life. Welcome. Come here. Live with us. We have got enough place." They want that sense gratification in the old age, when the senses are no more capable, still. (end)</div>
