<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">, teṣāṁ viṣṭhābhyāṁ vikraman visad to...</span>(?). (hums softly) What is your philosophy of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Philosophy of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What do you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Philosophy means why you are working, why you are living, what is the purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We are working for (indistinct), I have been working also. We just follow the same tradition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still there must some why. Why your forefathers they work and they die? So do you think that is the only philosophy, to work and die? That is being done by the animals also. They work and die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. First thing is, why you are working? What is the purpose of working? If the purpose of working is to work hard and then die, finished, then where is the difference between the animals and the men? They are also working. They are dying, too. Cats, dogs, hogs. Then after some time they die without knowing the purpose of life. Then where is the difference between cats, dogs, hogs and (indistinct) human beings. This question does not arise in the modern civilization. And one is thinking, "Yes, it is the same." But they're lying on the street, we're lying on a very nice apartment, bedstead. This is our profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it will take about a half hour to get the puffed rice.</div>

This is Mr. Ivy Mastram and he is in charge of the Hindu and Buddhist Department of the Department of Religion. And this is his next-in-command, director-general, Mr. G. Puja. He was educated in India also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, really. Which city?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Benares (indistinct) University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Benares University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Actually, they have arranged by giving a letter, that we can stay in the country. They simply say, "We do not object," and then the immigration gives us a good visa. They especially like your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, thank you. You have read some of my books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not my books. I am simply translating. They are written by Vyāsadeva, the original Vedic scholar. So there are now many secular states. Our Vedic idea of secular state is the government must be responsible of proper execution of religious system. It doesn't matter whether one is Hindu or one is Christian, one is Mohammedan or Buddhist. It doesn't matter. But it is a government duty to see that one who is professing as Hindu whether he's executing the Hindu principles of religion properly. That is government. Just like government gives license to so many businesses. One man is selling liquor, wine, government issues license. So the government inspector, excise inspector, goes and sees that the man is doing business according to the license. Government should not be callous that "You may go on with your so-called religion, we don't care for it." No. That is not government. Government's duty is to see, just like for example, Christians, their commandment, first commandment is, "Thou shalt not kill." It is the government's duty to see that anyone who is professing Christian, "Why he's killing?" Immediately he should be punished that "You are professing as Christian and you are killing." This is government. Similarly, Buddhist religion also, <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā.</span> <span class="Italic">Ahiṁsā paramaṁ buddhiḥ.</span> The government duty should see. And the ultimate test of first-class religion is: the follower has developed love of God. If he does not know anything about God, or if he has not developed love of God, then he has simply wasted time. It may be any religion. That is ultimate test because religion means, it has got relationship with God. Otherwise what is the meaning of religion? Any religion, it doesn't matter. The process should be quest of God. What is God? What is Absolute Truth? Wherefrom everything has come? What is we... what we are? What is our relationship with God? This science. Religion means this science. In the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This human life is meant for understanding the Absolute Truth. Otherwise, what is the difference between cats and dogs and human beings? If simply eating, sleeping, and sex life, and defend is the business of human life, then these things are there in the animal life also. They also eat. They also sleep. They have also sex life, and they also defend according to their capacity. We defend with atomic bomb and they defend their own nails and claws. The different spirit is there. So that is not the aim of human life. The aim of human life-this opportunity's given by nature to have a human form of life-is to understand God. Nobody can deny-unless he is a crazy fellow-the existence of God. That is not possible. There must be. I may know it or not know it, it doesn't matter. Therefore religion means to understand God and to awaken your dormant love for God. This is religion. Now there may be difference of process, according to country, time, people. Therefore, it is the duty of the government, it is the duty of the government... Hare Kṛṣṇa (someone enters). Formerly the kings, they were regularly supervising that their citizens were properly executing religious culture. That was government's duty. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So now government is callous about religion. I'm very glad to know that your government has left some department to supervise. What is your function in this department?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest 2:</span> Excuse me, my English is very poor. I would like Mr. Kunti to translate, Indonesian. (Indonesian)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He would like to have him translate English to Indonesian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He is the director of the (indistinct) of Hindu and Buddhist religion, from Department of Religious Affairs. His duty is to maintain and look after the development of (indistinct) expecting that all people of Indonesia that has to follow any kind of religions (indistinct) Christians, because we have also in charge for the Christianity, we have also in charge for the Muslim, or Islam, and we have also in charge for the Catholic and we have also in charge for other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good idea. This is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So because we have so many in the prosecuting of their religions, there might be, the people between many religions (indistinct). So the government have to lead the people how (indistinct), to supply also, in the (indistinct) of their materials for readings, and facilities for their, prosecuting their religions. This is the actual (indistinct) department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the idea which I was explaining that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Indonesian) As a matter of fact, also that we are looking from the Hindu and Buddhist religions' point of view, how to get (indistinct) this department, especially because we are feeling of lacking of materials because no of our books actually here, written in ancient Indonesian language, which are translated from Sanskrit (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ancient English...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Ancient Indonesian language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And now actually, most of the Sanskrit texts also, are not available anymore. Of course we have some few can be available from (indistinct) and that is why actually, to develop this new religions, as well as the Buddhist religion, which have a lack of material for reading. Now the government also tried to rewrite into Indonesian <span class="Italic">bhāṣā,</span> and as one of the aspects, for example, that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has been translated into Indonesian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mmmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Which we are expecting that this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> should be read by English (indistinct) and also, matter of fact, most of English readers can understand and they have the ideas of the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> and <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> and the essence of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Now the problems, at least the department has (indistinct) facing difficulties to supply materials that are actually needed by the people, is we are lacking of materials. So how, actually we have to solve this problem actually. We are actually, from the government point of view always looking and how we can try to get international relationships between various countries to solve the problems. As the same case also how to educate Indonesian peoples to study more about the Hinduism in order they can teach the Hinduism because in our country religious instruction is compulsory in our, any institution. So we felt, actually in our lack of material as well as lack of institution to develop this Hindu religions. And I, from our government actually, we are expected your visit here that it will be beneficial, both for our side, from the government point of view, and as well as for here and as well in your country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I think your problems can be solved if you kindly cooperate with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. That's why we are looking for... because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can give you correct idea of religious principles as well as our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religious idea without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion is mental speculation. They should be combined. Religious idea supported by philosophy. Then it is correct. And philosophy without religious idea is simply mental speculation. They should be combined. That combination of religious idea and philosophy, you'll find in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> provided you accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. If you interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in your own way, then you'll miss the point. Just like in our country, in India, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has been interpreted in so different ways that people are now bewildered. They do not know what is actually <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Take, for example... Just like in the beginning of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> I think you know Sanskrit. <span class="Italic">Samavetā yuyutsavaḥ māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva kim akurvata sañjaya [Bg. 1.1].</span> Even a great leader, political leader, he has interpreted <span class="Italic">kurukṣetra</span> as this body. So where is the dictionary where <span class="Italic">kurukṣetra</span> means this body? But because he's a big political leader that <span class="Italic">gītā</span> is going on. <span class="Italic">Kurukṣetra</span> means this body. <span class="Italic">Pāṇḍava</span> means the five senses. In this way [break] ...they cannot (indistinct) I may tell you frankly. Just like Mahatma Gandhi, he wanted to prove nonviolence from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā</span> is spoken in the battlefield, and how he can prove nonviolence from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Then he has to drag some interpretation out of his own way. But because he's a big leader the people are misled. Similarly, all... at present moment in India the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has becoming a plaything that anyone can interpret in his own way and do all nonsense. But I'll request you, because you are so much interested, and you have already approved <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you have translated. Amongst the leading personalities, you try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is and spread it, it will have immediate effect. That is already experimented. Just like in western countries, before me, hundreds and thousands, swamis and yogis went there. But not a single person could understand what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and what is Kṛṣṇa. Now hundreds and thousands of these boys in Europe, America, Canada, Africa, everywhere, Australia, everywhere, they are now become devotees... So they're intelligent persons, they're coming from rich family. Why they have taken seriously? Because they have understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> nicely. So I request that God is neither Indonesian, neither Indian, neither African, God is God. And He claims that all living entities, in any form... The form is superficial. The form is taken as dress. Just like you are dressed in a different way, I am dressed in a different way. But we are not talking to the dress, we are talking to the man who is putting on the dress. Similarly, this bodily distinction is material. But spiritually we are all one. There is no question of becoming Indian or Indonesian or African or Asian or this or that. And that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You know. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ. Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini śuni caiva śvapāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ</span> [Bg. 5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> does not see the outward dress, <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> sees the inside, who is putting on the dress. Therefore, without misinterpreting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> or being misled by so-called big, big leaders, if you try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, it will be very nice, beneficial to everyone. That is my, not opinion, but is the fact. Things should be taken as it is. Call a spade a spade. Now, interpretation is required when things are not clear. When things are not very clear, not easily understood... There is example in Sanskrit grammar, <span class="Italic">gaṅgāyāṁ ghoṣa bali</span>(?). The neighborhood of <span class="Italic">ghoṣa</span> family is on the Ganges. Now, on the Ganges-Ganges is water-how there can be a village? Now, here interpretation required. When the matter is [break] ...on the water but on the bank of the Ganges. So when the meaning is not clear, then you can interpret. But when the meaning is clear... Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> Now Kurukṣetra is still there, in..., about 90 miles away from Delhi. Perhaps you have been there. The station is there, Kurukṣetra. Now how one can interpret that <span class="Italic">kurukṣetra</span> means this body? This is going on. In spite of clear understanding, they interpret in their own way so that they have got their own philosophy, they want to support. This is going on. So if you kindly avoid this misleading interpretation, and if you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, then you get the science of God, science of religion, which is applicable either to Indonesian or Indian or African or American, everyone. The science is appreciated everywhere. Two plus two equal to four, this mathematical science is applicable everywhere. It doesn't matter whether one is a Christian or Hindu or Muslim. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the science of religion, science of God. So if you take this book seriously, and try to spread this knowledge among your countrymen, I think you'll be very much benefited. And it can be... We are preaching that. We are the, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is meant for one God, one scripture, one <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> like that, for all people of the world. And we are happy that people are accepting it in that way, very nicely. And it is very easy. It is very easy. So Mr. Director he has read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. He has read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And I think many Indonesian people, actually have read this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> because we have translated that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see. Very nice. So have you read our, this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You like it?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda;:</span> So religion must be there. Without religion the human society is animal society. There must be religion. And religion means to know God. That is religion. What is your explanation of religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Actually (indistinct) religion has to be defined as (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2): :</span>(indistinct) to understand religion is (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. They must be the same. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣad bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Religion means the course, or the laws given by God. Just like law means the law given by the state. I cannot manufacture law. The citizen cannot manufacture law. The law is manufactured by the legislative assembly of the government. Similarly, religion means the order given by God. Now we have to understand who is God, and what is His order, and how it is applicable to everyone. That is the system of religion. We cannot whimsically give some rituals as religion. The principle of religion is to obey the orders of God. Therefore the first principle is to know who is God. Unless I know what is God, then how I can know what is His order? So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the religion is given that-(Aside:) you are feeling sleepy, you can go-the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is religion. We have manufactured so many types of religion, and here God says that "You give up your manufactured religion. You just surrender unto Me." This is religion. Religion means to surrender. A good citizen means to surrender to the government law. Similarly, a religious person means who has surrendered to God. Nowadays it has become a regrettable fashion that everyone is God, when we surrender to one. And this false prestige that "I am God. I haven't got to surrender to anyone. I am God. What surrender?" This atheism is going on and spoiling the whole human society. God has become so cheap. Any nonsense can claim, "I am God." That is the defect of the modern society. There is a great necessity to understand God. If everyone is God then where is the necessity of religion? If everyone is president then where is the necessity of lawmaking? So this is going on. This is very unfortunate situation. What is your idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct) that in our Hindu text, for example, that when it's expressed <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi</span> is the Vedic version, that is all right. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi</span> means, "I am spirit. I am not this body." <span class="Italic">So 'ham</span> means, "I am the same quality as God." But they are misinterpretation: <span class="Italic">So 'ham</span> means, "I am God." This is nonsense. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's misleading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Misleading. People have become nonsense. (conversation between the two Indonesian guests) You have published <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> with commentary or simple translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> With commentaries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whose commentary you have followed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We try to take from various books and we try, at first we have to understand clearly their positions, then we put them in a simple way that everybody can understand it clearly. Only the part that's very difficult to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now here, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in the Fourth Chapter it is said, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> You can open to the Fourth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Indonesian) but according to our opinions that religion is something that true living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Something that we should live truly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> True living. Yes. True, just like good citizens...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good citizenship means living under the direction of the government. That is good citizenship. Similarly, human life means to live nicely under the direction of God. The cats and dogs, they cannot understand. But the human life, (pause) That first verse: <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam, vivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So what is your explanation of this verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You want to explain this into er... Do you want to explain this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam, vivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. This actually is explaining the origins of the law, ancient law, that's obeyed by the man. It's the law given from the Vedic literature...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa (indistinct) and coming to Ikṣvāku and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that (indistinct) means, that means this knowledge should be received from the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So actually they have acquired it from one source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One link. So that is being deviated. What Kṛṣṇa said to Vivasvān, to the sun-god now everyone is speaking in his own way, not in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is deviated. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, the Chapter, Fourth Chapter explains that you cannot understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> by your own interpretation. You must follow the instruction of the original speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. The original speaker is Kṛṣṇa. So what Kṛṣṇa says, they have to follow it. Then it is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Otherwise if you interpret it in a different way then it is not <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Now, what Kṛṣṇa says we have to understand it philosophically, ethically, scientifically, any way, any angle of vision. That is, that you can do. But you cannot change the version of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You cannot change. Just like Dr. Rādhākrishnan, in the Ninth Chapter when Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Dr. Rādhākrishnan says "It is not to the Kṛṣṇa person." But Kṛṣṇa person says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ,</span> "You just always think of Me." And he's deviating his readers, "Not to Kṛṣṇa." How much harm he's doing. This is going on. Why? It is said, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ,</span> "Just think of Me. Just become my devotee." What right he has got to say that here it is not to Kṛṣṇa? This is going on. So if we interpret in that nonsense way then we shall not be able to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We shall miss this point. Science does not mean that you have to change according to your whims. Two plus two equal to four. You cannot make it five or three. That is not possible. Then it is not science. No longer the scientific value of this two plus two remains. We follow that principle, and that is the only principle. So if you're actually serious about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> I do not know what is your commentary. I request you, "Try to follow the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Don't interpret in your own way. Then it will be (indistinct)." Everyone has got (indistinct) all over the world. Therefore we are selling this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is</span> very nicely. Our publisher's MacMillan Co. and their trades managers report is that our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is increasing daily, sales, other decreasing. That is the report, and in October they published 50,000 copies, it is already finished. Now they have to plan it for the second edition. People are very much now, eager to read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> So, imitating us, somebody's, another (chuckles) man, he said <span class="Italic">"Bhagavad-gītā</span> As It Was." (laughs with everyone) Like that. So that will not harm our cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Indonesian) One thing Mr. (indistinct) would like to answer from you, that, according to different view, objective reply, the object of this (indistinct) life, the objective of our religion is to be prosperous in this world and hereafter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is (indistinct) Prosperous. That is also stated, how you can become prosperous. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The problems work like this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is also stated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Whether this question also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. This is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This what it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you'll find this verse. (Aside:) Find out. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram, suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">śānti,</span> prosperity. They are... Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supreme Enjoyer. I am the sole proprietor of everything." <span class="Italic">Sarva-loka-maheśvaram. Sarva-loka,</span> not only of this planet, but other planets also. <span class="Italic">Loka. Loka</span> means planet, <span class="Italic">sarva-lokam.</span> So <span class="Italic">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram, suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām.</span> "I am the best, I mean to say, well-wisher friend of everyone." <span class="Italic">Jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati.</span> If one understands these three things only, that God is the Supreme Enjoyer. We are not enjoyer. But God is Enjoyer. That God is the Proprietor of everything. Not we are proprietor. We are subordinate. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also, it is stated, <span class="Italic">eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām. Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> The description of God is like that He's eternal amongst the eternals. We are also eternal, the living entities. And God is also eternal. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ... cetana,</span> He's the vital living force among all living forces. We are all living forces and He's the chief living force. Then what is the distinction between this singular number, <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> and the plural number, <span class="Italic">nityas?</span> The distinction is that that singular number, <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> is maintaining this plural number, <span class="Italic">nityas. Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān. </span>That is the distinction. Otherwise God is also a living entity like us, like one of us. But he's the chief. Just like father and children. Father is the chief man in the family and he's providing all necessities to life for the children, for the wife (indistinct). Although the father is also living entity and the children are also living entities, but the father is providing the children, and the children are being provided by the father. So this is the understanding. Unless we understand this, there cannot be any peace. That is the Vedic version. Anyone who understands this, he gets peace. Otherwise there's no possibility of peace. If I think that I am the proprietor, if I think that I am the enjoyer, or, in other words, I am God, then you'll never get peace. That is not possible. That is a false. If one of the children thinks that I am the independent, then naturally father will say, "All right, if you're independent, do your own business." This is an example. So if you want peace then, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you have to learn these three things. It is not very difficult. To accept God as the Supreme Enjoyer, and God as the sole proprietor of everything, and He's the best friend of everyone. Then you have peace. Anyone can appreciate this. Anyone can adopt this principle and he'll be in peace. And so long one will falsely think that "I am God. I am enjoyer, I am this, I am that." Then he'll suffer. False notion will never make him happy. He must come to the true, factual idea. Now you can examine that Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supreme Enjoyer." Now let us understand this one fact, how Kṛṣṇa's the enjoyer. Now suppose here is some banana fruits. Who has created this banana fruit? You are not manufacturer, I am not manufacturer. Somebody has created. We accept God has created and that's a fact. Then who should be the enjoyer? I shall be enjoyer or God shall be enjoyer? Anything you create, you become the enjoyer. Anything I create, I become the enjoyer. So if God has created this banana fruit, then who should be enjoyer? God or I?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our business is, we should offer this banana to God. "So it is Your creation, it is Your thing. First of all You taste it, then we take it." Then you become in peace. And if you falsely think that "I have created this banana tree. I have worked so hard. Now the fruit is there. Now I am the enjoyer." Then you are mistaken. Then next statement is, <span class="Italic">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka maheś... [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I am the proprietor of everything in the world." Now, beginning of this world, Bhūmi, land, this land, they're claiming this land Indonesian, this land American, this land Indian. But has the Indonesians or the Africans or the Indians created this land? Who has created this land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then He must be proprietor. But we are falsely claiming that, "I am the proprietor." So how you can be in peace? Suppose you steal something, somebody's property, and falsely claim, "I am proprietor," you'll never be peace because it is not your thing. You have stolen it. So in this way, if you... philosophy can be studied that God is the Supreme Proprietor, <span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ [Īśo mantra 1].</span> You can simply use what is given to you. You cannot claim other's property. Just like in animal life, animal life, they do not claim that "This is my country." The birds, they do not claim, but they live very peacefully. There are crows, there are spa... What is called? So many birds, they live anywhere, everywhere, but they do not claim, "Oh, this is my country. This is my place." They do not claim. Therefore they are free to move everywhere. So we have created a situation, Godless situation, therefore we are not in peace. So therefore, if you want peace, you must accept God, first of all. <span class="Italic">Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">,</span> this is the way of <span class="Italic">śānti.</span> You cannot create your <span class="Italic">śānti </span>in your own way. That is not possible. Just like the citizens, if they create their own way of <span class="Italic">śānti,</span> there cannot be peace. If they abide by the orders of the government, by the laws of the government, there will be peace. This is crude example. Similarly, if you do not accept God in the center as the Supreme Proprietor and the Supreme Enjoyer and the Supreme Friend, then there is no peace. This is the problem, I have given in the... What is that? You read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram, suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Translation:<span class="Italic"> </span>The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, obtain peace from the pangs of material miseries."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "The conditioned souls in the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. They do not know the formula for peace which is explained in this part of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The greatest peace formula is simply this. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> the Supreme Lord is described as <span class="Italic">param īśvarānāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaram.</span> Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey. But actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the defect. Lord is the master of material nature, and we are conditioned by the material nature and still we are claiming, "I am God." Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "Unless one understands these bare facts it is not possible to achieve peace in the world, either individually or collectively. This is the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Predominator and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the Fifth Chapter is the practical explanation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, generally known as <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> The question of mental speculation as to how <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> can bring liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge that the Lord is the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga</span> is the path leading to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Kṛṣṇa or Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with <span class="Italic">māyā</span>, illusion, due to the desire to lord it over <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while he is in the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is free from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on ones practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And attaining Kṛṣṇa consciousness by controlling the above mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage of <span class="Italic">brahma-nirvāṇa.</span> The eight-fold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There's a gradual process of elevation in the practice of <span class="Italic">yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna, </span>and <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> But these only preface perfection by devotional service which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in another place, it is stated, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> "After many, many births, when actually becomes wise, <span class="Italic">jñānavān māṁ prapadyate,</span> he surrenders unto Me." That is the perfection of knowledge. So this is... The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the only source of scientific knowledge of God and our relationship with God. I am very glad that you are already very serious about understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But I request you only that try to... and understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> without any, our man-made interpretation. That will be my request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What is one thing that I would like to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are always ready to help you in this.</div>
