<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "These people, they have no illicit sex, no intoxication?" Oh, immediately they become praising, "Such wonderful men. No illicit sex?" which is unknown to you, the Western people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think it is like Superman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Superman, actually. That is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, today starts a big international convention for the Association for Asian Studies, and we're there. It's in Toronto. We have an advertisement in this book, with <span class="Italic">Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> with a quote by that Bruce Long. And we have that big sign at our booth: "The largest publisher and distributor of books on the philosophy, culture and religion of India." This shows also with all the exhibitors, we're listed, the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. And this is where we are, this booth here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is taking care?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Two of the library men who didn't come, just so they could go to this convention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...therefore they search. And who goes to the airport? All respectable gentlemen, who can pay lump sum for air fare. So he's also searched out. That means there is no gentlemen. The airport security is searching through. Then in this world there is no gentleman, no honest men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everyone is suspected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All rascals. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But when you go through, Śrīla Prabhupāda, everybody offers their respects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They also sometimes show me the favor, but generally.... Sometimes they also search.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Search your pockets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, like this. (laughter) That way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's a great mercy for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is mercy. When they excuse a saintly person, that is, that is their great mercy. Now, according to Vedic law, a saintly person is never subjected to any law. He's <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> He's never.... Rather, the order is he must be given all help that he wants. That is the Vedic civilization. And <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, sannyāsīs,</span> they should be treated as children at home, so that wherever they go, they will be treated just like children: "Oh, he's my son. He's my dependent." They will treat like that. And they also go to every home: "Mother, give me some food." So he's children, as the child asks from the mother, "Give me some food." This is system. This is civilization. And M.A., Ph.D., and searching after woman, how to induce her, and being searched out in the airport, whether he's a rogue-what is this education? We don't want this education. [break] ...student life we have seen practically, one big professor, Dr. Brajendranatha Śrī. So he had another Ph.D. student, and that student kidnapped his daughter and went away. He was so educated that kidnapped his teacher's or the master's daughter and went away. <span class="Italic">.</span> What is that word? <span class="Italic">Kāmātura.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Kāmāturaṁ harṣa-śoka-bhayaiṣaṇārtam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone is <span class="Italic">kāmāturam.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja, millions of years ago, a five-years-old boy, he's stating what is the position of the materialistic person. This is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> [break] ...education system should be stopped, rascal, producing rascals and hippies in the university. What is the use of this education? Atheists, putting simply theories, and that is also nonsense, and it is going on in the name of education. [break]...Paṇḍita says.... Who is <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span>? Recite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Para-dāreṣu, para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat.</span> The.... Is.... It is moral instruction, what to speak of high education. Means it, preliminary moral education. That is,</div>
<div class="Verse">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat<br class="calibre2"/>ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is learned. What is the meaning? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One who sees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He'll explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu. Para-dāra</span> means "every woman." "Who can see every woman like, like mother..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And <span class="Italic">para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat. Para-dravya</span> means money, something of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Belonging to others."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, "of others." So who can see like <span class="Italic">loṣṭravat...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">para-drav...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...rubbish, or like rubbish, cannot take, cannot pick up. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat, ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu:</span> "Every living entity," <span class="Italic">ātmavat,</span> "like he himself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, as we feel pains and pleasures...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Sa yaḥ paśyati:</span> "Who can see like that..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they should know the others also will feel. If my throat is cut, I feel, and "Why shall I cut the throat of another, poor animal?" This is learned man. And this rascal, maintaining slaughterhouse, and learned man? And they cannot understand. And big, big priests, they'll defend: "Oh, this 'Thou shalt not kill' means it is meant for the men, not for the ani..." They'll put arguments. Christ says clearly, "Thou shall not kill" and they will defend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Even abortion they are defending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Even abortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this is going on as education, as saintly person, priest. These things are going on in the name of religion, in the name of education. How much fallen this world is, just try to understand. As soon as they are caught up, they'll defend only by arguments, counter-arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that because they have no standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that because they have no standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. How they can have standard? <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> How they can have good standard? Because they are atheists, godless, there cannot be. That is the test. As soon as he is godless, he's rascal. Never mind M.A., Ph.D. That's all. This is our conclusion. As soon as you know that "Here is a godless atheist," he is rascal. <span class="Italic">Bas,</span> finished. Exactly like.... Suppose you are in India, and if you think, "No, there is no government. It is going on automatically," then you are rascal, immediately. Is it very sane man, sane man's statement, statement, that "No, no, there is no God. It is going on"? So atheist means rascal. Such a nice arrangement is going on, exactly at 6:15 the sun is there, and "There is no government. There is no God." Just see how rascaldom. And then what it is? "By chance." And he is scientist. We have to consider them educated scientists? Are we going to be fooled like that? "There is no government." "There is no father." How the child came? "There is no father." Just see. A woman has got a child. And if somebody says, "Yes, she has got child, but there is no need of a father," is that sane man's proposal? Nature is producing, and nature is <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> but where is the <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span>? <span class="Italic">Prakṛti-puruṣa.</span> So without <span class="Italic">puruṣa,</span> how <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> can produce? That <span class="Italic">puruṣaṁ śāśvatam ādyam,</span> Kṛṣṇa.... Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ādi-puruṣam. Govindam ādi-puruṣam,</span> that <span class="Italic">puruṣa.</span> <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.</span> We are worshiping that supreme and original person. And the women are declaring, "independent." They are begging door to door to a man, "Please give me shelter. Give me a child," and they're independent. One American woman, was.... She was speaking that "In India the woman are treated as slave. We don't want." So I told her that it is better to become slave of one person than to slave of become hundreds. (laughter) The woman must become a slave. So instead of becoming slaves of so many persons, it is better to remain satisfied, a slave of one person. So she was stopped. She was the secretary of that Dr. Miśra. You know that? And our Vedic civilization says, <span class="Italic">narī-rūpaṁ pati-vratam:</span> "The woman is beautiful when she remains as a slave to the husband." That is the beauty, not the personal beauty. How much she has learned to remain as a slave to the husband, that is Vedic civilization. <span class="Italic">Kokilānāṁ svaro rūpam.</span> The cuckoo, it is black bird, but why people love it? Because of the sweet voice. <span class="Italic">Kokilānāṁ svaro rūpaṁ vidyā-rūpaṁ kurūpaṇam.</span> A man may be ugly, black, but if he's learned, everyone will respect him. And <span class="Italic">narī-rūpaṁ pati-vratam.</span> And the beauty of woman is how much she is devoted and obedient to the husband. So it is very difficult. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Prabhupāda, the education is to teach the students how to find out on their own. They say if you take authority from somebody else, it just stifles their growth, and that is not actually knowledge, that is not learning. But you encourage them or give them the facility...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why the rascal is called to the school? He may learn at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, they want to condition them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...with various values.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the value? If you are calling him to take education from the school, that means he is accepting authority. Let him be educated at home. Why the college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But in the classrooms, they simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, first of all, the principle? What is this principle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> To train him in the methods of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that means authority. You are teaching him to accept the authority. And you are teaching against authority. Everything contradictory. One side, contraceptive; one side, illicit sex. And the.... But Vedic civilization says, "All right, as soon as woman is widow, let her remain as a saintly woman-no more sex." But "No, you can marry and you can have sex hundred times daily, but use contraceptive." Is that civilization? To train one woman not to have any more sex, this is also contraceptive. And another way that "You can have sex any amount, as many times as you like. Take this contraceptive." Whose civilization better? And you call him to be trained up to accept authority and teach him, "Don't accept any authority." Is that education? Nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They're doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is the idea of the secular state, though...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, secul.... Whatever you name it, you're all set of rascals. That's all. (laughter) You can change the name in different way, but on the whole, you are all set of rascals. This is the whole world's beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> This modern theory, Prabhupāda, is that if a person wants to.... If he can maintain more than one wife nicely and wants to keep more than one wife, they won't allow. But if he can keep many young girls and spoil every one of them, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> .... that is praiseworthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And advertise publicly: "Topless, bottomless women are available here. Come here. School is open at ten o'clock at night. It goes on up to four." I have seen it. This is civilization, nightclub and topless, bottomless shop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The women argue, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that they can be given.... If they are given a good chance, they can make equal contribution in business, in science. So they are demanding equal rights, equal employment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why.... Why not equal rights that you stop producing children like the man? The man does not produce. Why you are obliged to produce?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is their special qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is.... Similarly, everything is special. You are a different entity. You must have different engagements. That is your perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But we all have.... The women and men, they all have the same brain, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I protested in Chicago. Yes. "And no, that is not the fact. The fact is man has 64 ounce. The woman has 36 ounce.... Highest."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They'll say intelligence is not dependent on the size of the brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say anything because they are rascals. A rascal can say anything. <span class="Italic">Pāgale ki nā bale chāgale kibā nā khāya:</span> "A madman, what he does not say? And a goat, what he does not eat?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> [break] ...Vedic civili...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic civilization means you don't talk rascal. Hear only. <span class="Italic">Śruti.</span> This is Vedic civilization: "You rascal, don't talk. Simply hear." This is Vedic civilization, <span class="Italic">śruti. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "Go to guru and hear from him." That is Vedic civilization. Don't talk, rascal. This is Vedic civilization.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in one BTG article, you listed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In one BTG article, you described increase in women population as a natural disaster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So when one woman read this article, she became very angry. She came back and was very angry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She may be angry. She is woman and man. Actually this is physiological. If a man is too much addicted to sex life, he'll become impotent, and if he begets child, it will be a girl. With no potency to give birth to a male child.... That requires potency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> When we were going around in London making life members, I noticed that in so many families, all the children are girls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The whole world is full of girls, girl children. Why? There is no potency. Potency finished. Or impotent. And if you keep one boy <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> no sex life, and get him married, the first child must be a boy, must be, without any doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> That means, then, woman is more potent than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Yes. The <span class="Italic">Āyur-vedic</span> formula is that when there is discharge, woman's discharge, more, means girl, and man's discharge, more, means boy. This is physiological.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The women argue that they are stronger than the men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are stronger than the man, that when there is fight, the man goes; you do not go. You are so strong. You are simply ravished in the absence of your husband. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now.... The women are joining the Army in America now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have seen a police in London. So I told that "If I catch your hand and give you a slap, where is your police?" (laughter) "I am old man. If I catch your hand and give you a slap, what police action will be there?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Prabhupāda, who is that prostitute the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> refer to...?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> say that "The great prostitute," I forget the name, "Pimba," or something, "says that..."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Who was that prostitute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are asking me? (laughter) As if I have to keep account of prostitute. (laughter) What is this nonsense? There was a big educationist, Visacandra Vidyasagara(?). So.... So to show compassion to the prostitutes, at night in a.... In India I have seen in our childhood, prostitute, they stand on the road. And in Paris I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere, they.... So, so they're standing-no customer at two o'clock. It is very cold. So Vidyasagara will take compassion: "All right, you take two rupees. Go home. Sleep." And that is in Vidyasagara's life, compassionate to the prostitute. By giving her two rupees, will she change her profession? But this learned man, he thought like that, that "She is standing in the severe cold. All right, let me.... Let me.... Let me give her two rupees. Then go home. Don't take so much..." He's Vidyasagara. The <span class="Italic">vidyā-sāgara</span> means "ocean of education." And Haridāsa Ṭhākura-a prostitute came for three nights and converted her to a devotee. That's it. That is real compassion, not that "Take two rupees and go home." No. Turn her. That is real compassion, to turn everyone to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the greatest welfare activity in the world. Otherwise there cannot be any peace or prosperity. Where is Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, he had a cold, and he's lying down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Why cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you are mentioning that prostitute is needed in the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for the rascals. Otherwise they will pollute the innocent girls. The innocent girls.... That is the policy of the Western civilization, that "Let the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> enjoy new, new girls and be energetic to produce machine." This is the European civilization, American civilization. Because the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> unless they have sufficient sex intercourse, they cannot work, so this is the policy: "Let all the girls remain open." They.... "Let them use and produce atomic bomb. Show your brain." The.... Just like the marriage.... According to Vedic civilization, marriage is allowed to the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> It is not that marriage allowed to the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> require sex. Therefore.... Why marriage is allowed to the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span>? Why not to the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>? Why it is not recommended? Because the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> require that enlivenment. Therefore they are allowed to marry. So in the European civilization it is only <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> There is no question of <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, vānaprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> There is no such idea. Therefore they want new, new girls. And that they have kept, this artificial law.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And no prostitution. And no prostitution, what means? That means there is prostitutes in the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Everybody's a prostitute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the Vedic civilization is "All right, you are not satisfied, one woman, don't pollute the innocent girls or in the home. Go to the prostitute." Still, in big, big cities, there is a quarter, prostitute quarter, still. They are professional prostitutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What was the Vedic punishment if somebody broke these moral principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What would be the punishment in a Vedic society if somebody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Picture, Fifth Canto. You see the description of the hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Hell. But I mean, within the society itself, there was punishment there also from the king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone who will commit sinful activities will be punished. That is nature's law. Exactly like that: If you infect some disease, you must suffer from that disease. The nature's law is so strict, and it is going on. It doesn't require any supervision. The supervisions are already made so perfect. You infect this disease: you suffer from it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In.... In the society, if somebody would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere, if you break the laws, you suffer. Anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Prabhupāda, science has develop methods where they can have sense gratification and.... Just like if they get some disease they can give them some medicine, and then the disease goes away very easily. So in this way, they're actually giving more facility for more sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do you like to accept it, that disease? Therefore it has been condemned, <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta.</span> Perhaps you have read it in the beginning of Sixth Canto. <span class="Italic">Prāyaścitta...</span> Parīkṣit Mahārāja condemned, "What is the use of this Vedic <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta</span> if it is suffering, again and again? Then what is the use?" That he has condemned. But <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta vimarśanam.</span> Therefore the rascal should be given knowledge that "You are attacked with some disease. Very good. You are injected with some medicine. You are cured. Then again you are attacked. So why you are going in this way? Stop it." And that is knowledge. That knowledge is also not perfect, because even a man in knowledge, he knows that "If I go to prostitute, I'll be attacked with syphilitic poison, and last time I had the same trouble. I had to spend so much money." But still he'll go, because he has no knowledge. So even one has no knowledge, if he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he becomes detestful: "Oh..." That is the, mean, gift of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">That the whole world is dark, misty. So you can invent so many means. Just like they have got, what is called, crackers? In the mist? Sometimes that is blown so that warn people that "Don't come here. There is danger."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Flares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you can invent so many means of curing the danger. But as soon as the sun is there, immediately all mist is over. Similarly, we have invented so many medicines and counteractions for so many things. But if one becomes a devotee, all these troubles immediately.... That is the only one medicine. He has no more any inclination. <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce: [Cc. Madhya 22.42]</span> "No more I want." And that is wanted. [break] ...<span class="Italic">asmi varaṁ na yāce.</span> One should be fully satisfied: "No more I want this material disease. That's all. Enough of it." That mentality required: "I don't want anything material facility." <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> means that, that "I shall live with the minimum necessities of life and simply devote..." That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> "I shall become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and enjoy all material facilities"-that is not <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> [break] ...recommended that "If there is no need, don't take even cloth. Remain naked." That is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> But because we have to preach, because we have to go the people, therefore some covering. Otherwise, this is also not necessary for a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Nothing. Lie down on the floor like the Śukadeva Gosvāmī said, and take water in your palm, no dress. Śukadeva was also not dressing, naked. That is the perfection of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> [break] Where is Jayapatākā? [break] ...talk with this boy. He wanted to.... [break] ...make. He's offering a land. Did you talk with him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No. I sent.... Śatadhanya talked with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> This man right here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, a different. This boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Yeah, we gave him one room last night. He's staying. And <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Bengali [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The Gurukula teachers had one question, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> At one time, you had instructed that all the children should attend the main class. They say that some of the very small children have trouble to keep their attention...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not small...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So they found that if they attend a separate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is common sense. Also attend many child in the lap of his mother. You see? He should also...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yeah, they find those seven-, eight-year-old, they attend better a small, private reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. But one thing is that if they can attend, even by hearing the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> they'll be benefited. Even they.... Therefore I give stress on chanting the <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> so that if one cannot chant and can under.... Simply by hearing, he'll be benefited. [break] Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I haven't seen personally. Have you seen them outside? It was supposed to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, where is the painting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Rāmeśvara said it's ready to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then let us go see. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] Little dark is. But not bad. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Jadurāṇī was saying he paints dark. He usually.... His style is to paint with dark colors</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It should be bright because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Effulgent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Also, he was worried that when the sun hits it, after a certain time it will just fade away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we should use such color which may not fade away. The picture is all right. The picture is all right. Simply it has to be made more bright. It is India. It is not London, always foggy. (laughter) (end)</div>
