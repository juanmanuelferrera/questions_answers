<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>May 9, 1973, Los Angeles</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was going to ask is there any difference between <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti</span> and mystic yoga power?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They call it mystic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mystic yogic power means the same <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti,</span> dormant potency which is within everyone. That can be awakened. The same example, as I have given, that everyone has got the potency to swim, but it has to be practiced. I cannot swim. For me, if one is swimming, it is inconceivable power. But I have got also that power. By practice, it has to be awakened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is a yogic process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is yogic process. Real yogic process is to find out Paramātmā, but side by side many other dormant powers become awakened. Another example, that tree is producing chemicals. So every living entity has got dormant potencies, more or less. So God, Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme living entity; therefore He has the full potency. God means full, complete. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> The best living entity, that is God. (pause) Is there any difficulty to understand the best living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The best living entity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that best living entity is God. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That means the best controller, the supreme controller. Just like this man is controlling his dog, and that man is controlled by somebody else. In his office or where he works, he is controlled by his boss. And the dog is controlling the cat, the cat is controlling rat. In this way, one after another, there are controllers. I control you, he controls me, another controls him. In this way, you go on searching. When you find out somebody who controls but is not controlled by anyone, He is God. Where is the difficulty to understand? Everyone here we see that although a person is controller, at the same time he is controlled. Therefore the ideal living entity is, he controls but he is not controlled by others. That is supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So the supreme living entity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is God. He is living entity, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the Vedic version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So he doesn't have to practice yogic power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because He is most perfect, He hasn't got to practice. Just like the fish hasn't got to practice how to live within the water, natural. <span class="Italic">Svābhāvikī.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">svābhāvikī.</span> <span class="Italic">Svābhāvikī</span> means by nature. If I want to fly in the sky, I will have to find out... Just like these boys are struggling with the waves with precaution, with so much practice, but a small fish, he doesn't care for big, big waves; it will go against. So that small fish is more powerful than you in that respect. You are struggling against the waves, but the small fish goes against the waves without any difficulty. A small teeny... So many things. There are many superiors than you. The most superior is God. That's all. That is the definition of God. You won't find anybody superior than Him. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no more any superior. That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When the living entity comes to the human platform, though he is conditioned, but still, by practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> he can develop...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of the powers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...which cannot be developed by other living entities, like for example, fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That distinction is there between one living entity and another. You have got some power, others have got another power. That's <span class="Italic">tara-tama,</span> means comparative and superlative... That is called <span class="Italic">tara-tama.</span> (pause) There are varieties of potencies. All these potencies are visible, some in you, some in me, some in others. But all the varieties in full potency is in God. That is God. Not like this rascal incarnation of God. What is that, they came? Bālajī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Guru Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not that. (laughs) That Kṛṣṇa was requested by His teacher that, when He was offering that "Now I am going home. What shall I present to you, <span class="Italic">guru-dakṣiṇā,</span> giving to the guru?" So he requested, "Kṛṣṇa, I have heard that You are so powerful. I lost my two sons. If you bring them..." So Kṛṣṇa immediately went and brought them from within the ocean. This is God. Similarly, Devakī also requested Kṛṣṇa that "Kṛṣṇa, before Your birth I lost seven children. Your maternal uncle killed them. So I want... I have heard that You have returned back the sons of Your teacher. Why not my sons?" So He brought them. That is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa went to Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu, penetrating the covering of this universe. Arjuna also went with Him. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No. Kṛṣṇa...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa went outside this universe, penetrating the sky. And Arjuna also accompanied Him. So it is Kṛṣṇa's power, He took His friend also. For ordinary human being it is not possible. But because Kṛṣṇa said that "All right, I'll take you." So He took him. This covering, universal covering, there are seven layers: earth, water, fire, air... Each layer is ten times bigger than the one layer. Then you go to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Ten times bigger than each layer, it increases?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That one layer, the other layer is ten times bigger than the first layer, and the third are ten times bigger than that, ten times. In this way the whole universe is covered. What your scientists know? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Scientists say that there are different layers in the atmosphere. There is ionosphere and all those spheres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, some ideas are there. But in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is all written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they do not say that ten times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they know? They do not know anything. Know something. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So when we establish the theory of <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti.</span> First of all you have to establish that life is not from matter. Matter is from life. Then they will be under your control. First of all you have to establish. Because their whole scientific advancement is going on on this basis, that life is from matter. But that is not the fact. Matter is from life, just the opposite. First of all you have to establish this. Why don't you write a theory and get Nobel Prize? This is a fact. Now you have to prove only, by their scientific words. That's all. Fact is this is. Are you convinced about this fact, that matter comes from life, not life comes from matter? Are you convinced or not? Otherwise how you can write?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, I am convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why don't you write in scientific language. All these material elements have come from life. Not that from material elements, life has come. No. That is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate,</span> "Everything from Me." But Kṛṣṇa is life. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">, janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> So... And <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> So many informations are there. Me, "Mine," "I am," like that. So He is life. Our God is not dead. Our God is life, living, just like us, one of us. But He is more powerful. That's it. Our God eats, sleeps, like us, just like we eat, sleep. The difference is that He eats, but He keeps the thing as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> <span class="Italic">Oṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idam [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we eat, we finish. And we cannot again produce. God's power is like that, that He eats, at the same, keeps everything intact for your eating. And I, if you give me a plate, I eat and there is nothing for you. That is difference. He also eats. Otherwise we are making all these bogus things, preparing so many nice things, offering to God? Is that false?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate [Iso</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is so complete that one minus one equal to one. That is Absolute. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is expanding Himself by so many energies, but Kṛṣṇa is the same. There is no loss in His energy. Even in a human being or animal, he produces so many children. Just like hog-he produces at least one dozen children every year, but the hog is the same. If a hog can have so much power... And formerly one man used to produce hundreds of children. Wherefrom the potency comes? If a man is giving birth to hundreds of children, but still, he is the same man, wherefrom the potency comes? Why man? Even the fish, thousands of eggs they produce, and thousands of fishes are again produced. Wherefrom the potency comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From the supreme controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not supreme... He has got. From the supreme control..., yes, but directly we see that He has got so much potency. Everything is coming from Supreme; that's a fact. But you can see hundreds and thousands of children produced by one single living entity. The snakes, they produce hundreds and thousands of children at a time. Fortunately, they eat their own children. Otherwise, the whole world would have been full of snakes only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All animals, they eat their children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I have seen the eggs of snakes. They are small, this big, the eggs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> As the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga</span> advances, the human beings will eat their children too. Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Just like in the last war, they ate stool, their own stool, out of hunger. So when there will be no foodstuff, they will kill their own children. Already they are killing, abortion. Not only abortion, children grows... By surgical instrument, they kill and they take out the child... They are already killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> When they take the pill, the birth control pill, are they killing their children too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Killing means killing, what is that? What he is asking? I do not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He is asking that they take the pill, birth control pill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is one kind of killing. But directly killing. They, through some instrument, through the vagina, they kill, cut into pieces and get out. Living children. He is a scientist. That surgeon, he is a scientist, and doing this business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, medical scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. He is paid for that killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They lost the mercifulness, the quality...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What merciful? Animal has mercifulness. They are animals only. This modern civilization is producing animals. That's it. Who was speaking that slaughterhouse they are giving some injection that the animal may not feel pain? Rascal, he is killing him, and he is humanitarian work, he may not feel killed. If I say, "I shall kill you, but you will not feel any pain. Come on." This is their philosophy. They are killing, and they are saying, "Oh, may not be feeling any pain." Such rascaldom is going on. I therefore do not talk with any rascal except my disciples. I know they are all rascals. Waste of time. All this rascaldom is coming out of that wrong notion that life is from matter, that wrong notion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is why they say, "So long as I am alive, enjoy as much as you can."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is their philosophy. Hedonism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If they know that there is life after death or life started from life, then they would not be doing like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things you will change. (pause) And that is mystic power for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> Surfing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because I do not know how to do it. Therefore it is mystic power. But the boy is going like this. (pause) Just like one of the yogīs, she (he) walked over the river, crossed. So another old man said: "Oh this is only two <span class="Italic">paisā</span> worth." Why? "I will pay two <span class="Italic">paisā</span> to this boatman. He will cross me there." But to attain that power, he had to spend so many years for practicing. This is waste of time. If you can do it by paying two <span class="Italic">paisā</span> or one <span class="Italic">ānā</span> to a boatman to cross the river, why should you for ten years or fifteen years practice this yoga, just to show a magic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda, I remember an incident in Bombay. That was when I was in Calcutta about, a few years ago. There was a yogī. There was advertisement that he was going to walk on water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So I think it was about five hundred rupees per ticket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, just see. His real aim was to get some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Radhakrishnan was there, the president. But ultimately, he could not walk. He fell down in the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what about the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I don't know. He was beaten or something. They said he missed something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's like you, chemist, just missing something, "In future we shall do it." It is the same thing. And these fools, Dr. Radhakrishnan and company, they are so fools that so many animals they are walking on the sea, "I am going to see another man." Just see, how they are fools. What is their credit? The sea lark. They call sea lark? They go very nicely. Why do they not see that? He is animal, he is, another is an animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> Birds can float and they can fly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So Dr. Radhakrishnan was a big rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But I could not believe by that time. I said, "It cannot be possible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is possible. It is possible. If one has practiced yoga system, He can become light. To walk over the water means to become very light, like cotton swab. Then he can walk. He can fly also. In Siddha-lokas, the inhabitants there, they fly in the sky. From one planet to another planet they go by flying. There is Siddha-loka planet. Therefore they are called Siddha-loka, means they have all perfection of this yogic mystic power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> Are Siddha-lokas like angels, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Angels, you can call, they are angels. But there are human beings who fly. In your side, Kāmakaḥ (?), there are some ladies who fly in the sky on a tree. You have not heard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I very vaguely have heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are. They can fly in the sky on a tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When I was a child, our grandfathers used to tell those things. So I would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is a fact. That is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> also, that... Whose daughter? She dreamed of a nice husband. So her friend,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> Uṣā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Uṣā, Uṣā, yes. So Aniruddha. That friend brought Aniruddha, Kṛṣṇa's son. She dreamt Aniruddha. So she promised, "I am bringing you just picture, which picture do you like?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> Citralekhā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Citralekhā. Yes, he remembers. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There is an experiment that was done by Pasteur, a French scientist a long time ago. In that experiment he boiled some, I think it was water. Because normally the water, without boiling there are so many microorganisms, small, small living entities, that can be detected under microscope. He wanted to know whether life started from some ingredients inside or just life started from life. So he boiled this solution and he kept for some time under very careful covering so that there is no contamination from outside. And then there was no life. He couldn't find any organisms. So they said, "Life starts from matter." That is one of the experiments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Boil water first of all. Without boiling water, they can detect so many organisms, small, small bacteria and these small, small living entities under microscope. But when they would boil it and it kept for some time, and then they tested, there was no organisms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that microscope is imperfect. That is our contention. Because the living entities, the dimension of the living entity is 1/10,000th part of the top of your hair. So what you can see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Also, they make the condition unsuitable for the spirit soul to occupy. Just like if we take and kill all these bodies and put them somewhere, and come back in a week, it's not that life will come back to the bodies. They make the circumstances unsuitable for the spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is another explanation. It takes time. Besides that, according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> life is not killed by fire. <span class="Italic">Aśoṣyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam.</span> You have not read it? <span class="Italic">Adāhyaḥ:</span> "It cannot be burnt into fire." So how life can be killed by boiling water? That is their nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> As soon the bodies become unsuitable, so the spirit soul leaves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aśoṣyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam. Adāhyaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But by putting proper chemicals, then they can see again. The ingredients necessary for the survival of the living entities, the necessary amounts, like source of protein, source of carbon, then the life is again started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Wherefrom the life came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's not started. It becomes suitable again for the spirit soul. So they come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī:</span> They're just changing the living conditions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Like if you put honey, ants will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good example. That does not mean the honey is producing ants. If life is coming from matter then why you are putting chemicals? That is also matter. Life will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say, without the chemicals, they cannot see life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The chemical is also matter. Just like with one matter you make... Just like we mix so many matters. Turmeric, salt, spices, they are all matter. But mixing together, the condition is that it becomes a sweet vegetable. Similarly, the chemical is also matter. And water is also matter. So if life comes from matter, then it will come from the water. Why...? There is no use of mixing another chemicals? And it will actually be: Then let the water remain for some time. When it will decompose, the life will come. The stagnant water, life will come. Just like in the ocean, there are so many lives are coming out. Who is going to put the chemical? Nonsense. Where you have got so much chemical? And you can find out tons and tons, millions of tons of fish, but nobody went to give there the chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They will say, nature supplies the chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore that nature's potency is <span class="Italic">acintya.</span> That is beyond your calculation. That is our point. How nature is supplying, that you do not know. How there is very common thing. Just like from my body there are so many worms and germs will come out from the stool, there are so many worms. I am also producing life. I am not going to add some chemical. But the chemical is being supplied by me, by my potency. Otherwise, why so many worms are there in the stool? Hookworm and this worm and that worm? Sometimes from wood, what is called, termite? They come. And who is going to supply there chemical? And not from all wood. At a certain stage, it will come, without your adding chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The chemicals are already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Already there. Everywhere chemicals are there. When the suitable circumstance is complete, then there is life. <span class="Italic">Svedaja.</span> They are called <span class="Italic">svedaja.</span> By fermentation, by perspiration, life will come. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍaja. Aṇḍaja</span> means coming from the egg. (end)</div>
