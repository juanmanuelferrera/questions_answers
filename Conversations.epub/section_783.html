<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> So this should be mentioned. It is not only a temple, but a planetarium according to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, </span>where which planet is situated, where is Vaikuṇṭhaloka, where is Goloka Vṛndāvana, where is Mahar...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Wow!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want a real planetarium just like in the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's what I told them, Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> ...that this is not a temple; this is like a big cultural exposition, museum, planetarium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Boy, Prabhupāda, the people will pay... Everyone will pay a rupee to go in and see that. One rupee for that, one rupee to ride the escalator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there will be escalator to take them to different planetary system. Mention there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> My father... In those planetariums, they use a machine in the center that shoots out light. My father helped to invent that, so we could probably...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So bring your father. Father and son, both together. He is... Where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So call him. He'll not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I don't think so, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No, no. He reads your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> every night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then why he'll not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I think he's too much attached to my mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Your mother is not old enough? What is the age of your mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Sixty-eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, still she is attractive? (laughs) A girl of sixty-eight? That's nice. Very good husband. And what is your father's age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Sixty-eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Sixty-eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> American system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, here also, some cases. Gandhi's wife was one year older than Gandhi, yes. Kaustubha Gandhi, she was seventeen years old, and Gandhi was sixteen years old, and they were married. There are many cases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was arranged by their parents, or they did it themselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, by their parents. Except in Bengal, in other provinces they do not take much care of the age. Generally the bridegroom is older. Boy is older than the girl. [break] ...was married, he was eleven years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Eleven years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And his wife, my mother-in-law, was seven years. Dr. Rajendra Prasada, the president, he was married when he was eight years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughing) How old was his wife?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was sleeping. The marriage party goes to the bride's house. So it was to be... The time fixed was at twelve o'clock or one o'clock. So the bridegroom was sleeping. So all the men made: "Oh, get up! Get up! You have to be married! Now you get up! Get up! Get up!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He didn't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not know what is marriage. "Get up! Get up! You have to be married now."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So in such cases they would live separately, though, until they grew older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Until the girl is twelve, fourteen. She must be pub..., be puberty period. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But still, they know who they are married to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they don't have any anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...age was at that time eleven years. So she came to live at the age of thirteen years, and at fourteen years she gave birth to a child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> How old were you, Prabhupāda, when you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> How old were you when you got married?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was student, so we were living separately. When she was thirteen years old, after puberty, then she was at... But there are many mothers still-the difference between the child, first child, and mother, twelve years. There are many mothers. At twelve years they gave birth to a child, especially in Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In America that is considered very horrible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Catastrophe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All my sisters were married within twelve years. My second sister, she became twelve years, and I heard my mother become so disturbed: "Oh, this girl is not being married. I shall commit suicide." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At twelve!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twelve years. And she was given to a boy, my brother-in-law, for the second marriage. Means that my brother-in-law lost his first wife, and still, he was twenty-one years old. My sister was twelve years old and brother-in-law was twenty-one. In the <span class="Italic">śāstra...</span> I do not know exactly what is that <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> but they say that if the girl before marriage has menstruation, then the father has to eat that menstrual liquid. Means it is, mean, very strict. And if the father is not living, then the elder brother has to eat. [break] ...ty of getting the girl married rests on the father. In the absence of the father, the eldest brother. The girl must be married. That is it. It is called <span class="Italic">dāya, kanyā-dāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Dāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dāya. Dāya</span> means legally inheritance. That is called <span class="Italic">dāya.</span> Just like your father's money you get automatically. So similarly, <span class="Italic">kanyā-dāya</span> means to get the girl married is a <span class="Italic">dāya.</span> You cannot refuse it. It is incumbent, you must do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So many of our, the girls in our society, they have reached that age, but they are not getting married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, your society is different. Now it is here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean in ISKCON, in our society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ISKCON is not going to be social reformer, but as far as possible, we can help. Our main business is how to make everyone Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our business. We cannot take up, but if possible, we can take up all the system of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> is neglected, then how can there be proper functioning of society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If the society chants Hare Kṛṣṇa seriously, then it is all right. Never mind whatever is done. It doesn't matter. <span class="Italic">Pāpī tāpī jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo.</span> This is the power of <span class="Italic">hari-saṅkīrtana.</span> If one is absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all benefit is there. So long in the bodily concept of life, we require this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span>. Otherwise there is no necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu you have read in the eighth chapter, <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā,</span> talk between Rāmānanda Rāya and Caitanya Mahāprabhu? So "Perfectional life how begins?" This question was raised by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Rāmānanda replied, "It begins with the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span>, regulated social life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He rejected that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not rejected. "Yes, it is not very important." <span class="Italic">Eho bāhya:</span> "This is external." <span class="Italic">Āge kaha āra:</span> "If you know something more." So the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is a good help undoubtedly, but it is not important for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise how could I start this movement in the Western country? There was no <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span>. But that did not hamper my movement. Now people are surprised: "How these people have become such great devotees." So it was not based on <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span>, no, because the whole movement is spiritual. It starts from the spiritual platform, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi. Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">. Samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ, bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ param.</span> Now just like here is a gap. So you can go by the bridge, and if you can jump over, that is also going. That is also going. So to become Kṛṣṇa conscious means to jump over to the spiritual platform immediately. And this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> <span class="Italic">sannyāsa, varṇa-tyāga, karma-tyāga,</span> these are different steps only. But if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious seriously, then you jump over all these steps; you go immediately. That lift and the staircase. By staircase you go step by step. By lift you can go immediately, faster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Even some of these women, they're not married but they are serving Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ [Bg. </span>9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">striya,</span> generally they take it, "Even she is prostitute," <span class="Italic">striya. Te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim:</span> "They can also go back to home, back to Godhead." <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha...</span> If he takes Kṛṣṇa very seriously, then everything is possible. No impediment. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> Kṛṣṇa devotional service is so strong that it cannot be checked by any material impediments. The <span class="Italic">smārtas,</span> they are thinking like that, "How these <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas</span> can become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>?" But they do not know that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can jump over. <span class="Italic">Māyām etāṁ taranti te. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">. Māyā</span> is very strong. Therefore there are gradual process. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama-dharma, karma-tyāga,</span> this, that, so many things, pious activities, rituals. But this is the process, step by step, to cross over <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> But Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> Anyone who surrenders to Kṛṣṇa sincerely, immediately he crosses over. As Kṛṣṇa says in another place, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "I'll do immediately." So <span class="Italic">māyā</span> means <span class="Italic">pāpa.</span> Unless one is sinful, he cannot be in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So if one surrenders, then he, means, immediately crosses over <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So these <span class="Italic">smārta brāhmaṇas,</span> they consider this thing. They are thinking, "How a person born in other families, they can become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So they have no faith in devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What was the conclusion last night with Caitya-guru and Mr. Motilal. I couldn't follow in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Then you come to <span class="Italic">Gītā's</span> instruction, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> And Nārada Muni also says that one must be qualified, not the birth. Just like this Mullik, and we had the same <span class="Italic">gotra,</span> but the marriage cannot take place within the same family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Within the <span class="Italic">gotra.</span> In the same <span class="Italic">gotra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same title, De, and same <span class="Italic">gotra;</span> therefore it is the same family. That is the proof. So in the same family there cannot be any marriage. <span class="Italic">Sa-gotra. Sa-gotra-vivāha-niṣedha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So no member of your family could have married someone in the Mullik family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is another Mullik family. They are different from our family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are not De's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not De's. They are Sil's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sil. Their title is Sil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Sil. Sil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Sil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sil Mullik and De Mullik. There are two Mulliks. Their <span class="Italic">gotra</span> is also different. So in the marriage, before marriage taking place, one has to calculate whether they belong to the same family, same disciplic... Then, if it is the same, the marriage will not... Same blood will not be accepted. Same family means same blood. So throughout the whole world same blood is not allowed, marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's going on other places in the world too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All over the world. They say that what will happen... One thing that will happen is that if there's any... Of course, this is scientists' explanation. If there is any weakness within the family line-that means bodily weakness, mental weakness, or anything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even it is not weakness, it will create weakness, same blood. The different blood will create some incentive, different flow of blood. That is scientific. But who cares for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nowadays...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Mohammedans, they accept the same blood. Therefore they are not very intelligent. Throughout the whole world the Mohammedans are not very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They marry within their family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And uncle's daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Uncle's daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The father and his brother, so his daughter, his son can marry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> First cousins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First cousin, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> There was some case of that in the royalty in France, and they got some bleeding disease from that, hemophilia. If they got any cut, then that would never heal. It would only bleed until they died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is very scientific not to get married of the same blood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Many people ask us what <span class="Italic">gotra</span> we are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are <span class="Italic">acyuta-gotra.</span> You can say <span class="Italic">acyuta-gotra. Acyuta</span> means never falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Never falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is such a <span class="Italic">gotra</span> as that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">acyuta-gotra.</span> All devotees are... We are identified with Kṛṣṇa's family, <span class="Italic">acyuta-gotra.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me acyuta. Acyuta</span> is Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa conscious man means <span class="Italic">acyuta-gotra.</span> (end)</div>
