<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not within the Vedic culture. Vedic culture means this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma:</span> four <span class="Italic">varṇas,</span> four <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> And those who are lower than the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they are not in the Vedic culture. They are called <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> Among these <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas,</span> the <span class="Italic">mleccha, yavana,</span> are also there. There are. <span class="Italic">Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> So they are also <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas,</span> fifth status. Fourth status, up to <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> and then all fifth status. So amongst the fifth status, there are all meat-eaters, without any restriction. And there are dog-eaters. So amongst them, the fifth status, one who eats dog, he is considered most abominable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would a Vedic king try to prohibit such persons from eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...animals of any kind? Would a Vedic king try to prohibit the fifth-class men from eating the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Animals, you can eat if you like. But there was no slaughterhouse. If you like, you can kill your own animal and eat. That was open. But the state did not maintain any slaughterhouse. And the third-class, fourth-class men, they would eat. So simply by saying that "You don't eat," they will not accept that. They're free, but the state would not maintain the slaughterhouse. At the present moment also, if the slaughterhouse are closed, then immediately seventy-five-percent meat-eating will be stopped. They maintain slaughterhouse. That is the most sinful activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> That was Nehru's contribution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Nehru started that slaughterhouse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is British contribution, the <span class="Italic">mlecchas.</span> Before British period, even in Mohammedan period, there was no slaughterhouse, neither the public used to take cow's flesh. Still in Mohammedan country, Afghanistan, these places, they do not take cow's flesh. Lamb, goats. In the Vedic culture, the cow is recommended to be protected, not other animals. Other animals, the meat-eaters can eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even the buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, buffalos. Cow is very important animal. Therefore it is recommended to protect it. From social benefit point of view, it is essential that cow should be protected so that you can get lots of milk preparations and keep your health very nice. So many nice preparations can be made from milk. In New Vrindaban, the other farmers, they come. They are surprised to see: "Oh, so many nice preparations!" They are appreciating. They do not know. It is the industrialist who has introduced this meat-eating. Because they are attracting men from village to work in the factory, so they have made it a policy that "We shall eat cow's flesh. That's all. We don't require..." In Russia, practically, they eat only cow's flesh. They do not know anything else to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in your books you've stated that the position of the cow is as important as the position of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm ? Yes. <span class="Italic">Go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.</span> We offer respect to Kṛṣṇa as the well-wisher of the cows and the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Brahminical culture and preparation from milk makes a man perfect for spiritual understanding. Therefore they are two very important items, <span class="Italic">go-brāhmaṇa hitāya ca.</span> In the society, if there is no brahminical culture and no cow protection, that is animal society. That is not human society. We are trying to bring the animal society to human society to fulfill the mission of human life. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> distribution is very important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We find that when people taste the Sunday Feast, it's so nice that they want to give up meat-eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> When people taste the Sunday Love Feast at the temple, it's so nice that they want to give up their meat-eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least, they express that sentiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they'll do if they are continually eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> In New York so many people are coming, they want to start a Saturday feast also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no harm. We want to distribute all the days <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Yes, if possible. Give them all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> We've heard in America that they are eating their own children. They perform abortion, and then they take that fetus and they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Some hippie cults.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Andy Warhol...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's not widespread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is not widespread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> We've seen in the newspaper that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will increase, this idea. They'll put forward some scientific method... (devotees laugh) Yes. Now for the abortion the so-called scientists, they're explaining in a scientific way that "This is very good action." That I was talking with that Indian scientist. I gave him slaps: "Rascal, you are scientist." The government engages that "Write scientific book for killing your own child." And they'll accept: "Oh, it is scientific." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Now the scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything nonsense you do, that is scientific, artist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Now the scientists have another plan for changing all the plastic to eatable foodstuffs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> There's something they put on the plastic so you can now eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like the Germans, they extracted fat from stool. And that was used as butter. This is scientific. They'll have to eat stool even. They have eaten. In the last war, concentration camp, they have eaten their own stool. There was no food. So nature will punish them in that way. They'll eat everything. This godless civilization will lead people to such condition of life. <span class="Italic">Kadharya bhakṣaṇa kare, tara janma adho pate yaya.</span> This life they will eat everything, all nonsense thing, and next life they become pig, cats, dogs. That's all. This will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> The scientists are saying that milk is the major cause for heart attack. Milk is a very harmful food. It causes heart attack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Milk is the miracle food, and they are condemning by a scientific process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> These Chinese people, they hate to drink milk. They like to take yogurt and butter and things, but they won't drink milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is yogurt as healthy as milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yogurt is healthy when you cannot digest properly. One who can digest, for him, milk is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> (Heavy wind static) Even now the...</div>
