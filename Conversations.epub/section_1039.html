<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...forest, naked, renounced, eating fruits. But debauch number one. <span class="Italic">Markaṭa-vairāgya.</span> There are so many <span class="Italic">vairāgīs. Markaṭa.</span> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said, <span class="Italic">ei 'ta kali-celā. </span>Here is a disciple of <span class="Italic">Kali. Nāke tilaka galāi mālā.</span> But has got a <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> on the forehead and neckbeads on the neck. But is <span class="Italic">Kali-celā</span>-number one disciple of Kali. You know this song? <span class="Italic">Kali-celā.</span> These persons who are committing sinful life-don't say anyone (laughs) or publish-there will be trouble. But that's a fact. Those who are living in Vṛndāvana and acting like monkey, they'll get next life-a monkey. To remain in Vṛndāvana, and then next life they will be liberated. In one life all their sinful activities will be punished. Because as soon as animal life is obtained, there is no more further record of the sinful life. The animals cannot make sinful activities more than what is destined by him. But their sinful activity is not taken into account. For this man who is offered this monkey's body, he suffers the inconvenience of monkey life. So his sinful activities are counteracted, and because he came to Vṛndāvana and lived in Vṛndāvana by the mercy of Rādhārāṇī, next life he will be... That is the glory of Vṛndāvana-dhāma. Otherwise what is the explanation of these dogs and hogs and monkeys in Vṛndāvana? If it is <span class="Italic">dhāma-aparādha,</span> committing offense in <span class="Italic">dhāma. Dhāma-aparādha.</span> As <span class="Italic">dhāma-bhajana,</span> if one undergoes devotional service out of Vṛndāvana and one executes devotional service in Vṛndāvana, that is hundred times better. Similarly <span class="Italic">dhāma-aparādha</span> also. This <span class="Italic">aparādha,</span> when offense is committed outside Vṛndāvana, that is not so grievous as committing offense in Vṛndāvana. <span class="Italic">Dhāma-aparādha.</span> So the punishment is there, but the reward is also there. One life makes pardoned. <span class="Italic">Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span> 10.14.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore a devotee in a reverse condition of life, he understands that "I am punished. Little punished for my previous mischievous activities. So now I am becoming liberated." So he becomes more enthused to worship the Lord, that "You are finishing my sinful reaction of life with slight punishment. Thank you very much. This is devotee. <span class="Italic">Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The dogs and monkeys, they feel grateful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when they come to sense they feel grateful. As dogs they cannot. As dog or monkey they cannot enhance their sinful activities. It is stopped. And whatever they do, that is not taken into account. And to suffer as dog or monkey means counteracting all previous sins. One punishment finished. Then he's fully liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I was always wondering that if somebody's desire is to commit sinful activities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in Kali-yuga if you desire it is not sinful. And act...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> If they desire to commit sinful activities and before they became monkeys, but then they were doing it then. So whilst they're monkeys their desire must change. Or is it forced, that change forced upon them by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if desire changes, then where is punishment? If he's repentant, then there is no punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So before they go back to the spiritual world that desire must change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is forceful change. That is the advantage of Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That is very good. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But not that willfully do something wrong. There is punishment. If one unconsciously, without any knowledge, does something wrong, that is excused. But they do willfully. They know it is wrong, still they do it. That is punished. Knowingly. Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally said, <span class="Italic">asat eka strī-saṅgī.</span> Those who are habituated to illicit sex are punishable. <span class="Italic">Asat.</span> It is very, very bad. And still if somebody does like that, he is punished. This is going on. "All right." Here illicit sex... The <span class="Italic">bābājīs,</span> I heard, they say, "What is the wrong there? It is love." They say like that. They take it as love. "<span class="Italic">Gopī's</span> love," they say. "<span class="Italic">Gopī's</span> used to do that, used to have illicit mixing, intermingling with Kṛṣṇa. What is wrong?" They'll say. They get support from Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> Such rogues they are. <span class="Italic">Sahajiyās.</span> There are many so-called gentlemen, they write books on Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> paint picture." This is very nice. Kṛṣṇa is advocating illicit intermingling." They take it as support of their sinful activities. I have seen personally. Anyone who is a woman-hunter, he's being addressed by his friend, "Oh, you are like Kṛṣṇa." They take Kṛṣṇa as a man. How they will take instruction of Kṛṣṇa? <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">]. Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ.</span> We are teaching people to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, to become servant of Kṛṣṇa, and the so-called gentlemen, enlightened gentlemen, take Kṛṣṇa as a debauch. Black debauch. [break] ...Vaiṣṇava religion is sex. [break] There are aborigines in India. <span class="Italic">Santal,</span> (?) they are called <span class="Italic">santal.</span> Black men, live in the forest like the African aborigines. So I asked him that "You, jungle, do you meet the tigers?" "Oh, yes, yes. Why not?" "So how do you save yourself?" So he had a small axe in his hand. So he showed me that "So long I have got this axe, even the tiger will not dare to attack me." (Bengali or Hindi) After all, tiger is afraid of the axe. They are afraid of even stick. That immediately they understand, "He's superior." Actually man is superior with some weapon. I have got personal experience. He said, "He's a big tiger. But we treat them like dogs." One axe. They keep always. Just like we keep a stick, they keep one axe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Last year they bit Upendra. Remember that? Upendra went to Sevā-kuñja and the monkeys came and took away all of his <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and bit him in the leg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many monkeys were deported by the government but people protested. They were capturing monkeys...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Government. And selling at good price in Europe for taking their hormone. The monkey's hormone is injected or replaced so one regains his sex power. They are very sexually strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That must interfere with that monkey's spiritual life. That interferes with the spiritual life of the monkey? Because then he can't die in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is further from them. Everything is being done by superior arrangement. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> People should learn all these things by practical example instead of becoming irresponsible and without any obedience to the superior law. They should learn it, but they have no intelligence. They think, "We are all free." Wherefrom the monkey is coming, why there are so many varieties of life, how it is...? What do they know? Nothing. All bluff, vague explanation and that is going on in the name of science. This is the position. All rascals. Fortunately we have got this <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> All knowledge. First-class knowledge. [break] ...eternally-enjoyment. For him everything, <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> He has no such thing that this is harmful, that this is useful. That is Kṛṣṇa. Because nobody can do harm to Him and neither in the spiritual world, anyone is harmful. Everyone is advanced devotee. Even the tigers, they are also devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Tigers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Varieties are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have tigers and serpents and everything like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. They are all devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There are no dogs and hogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The hogs may be also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hogs are there as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are not hog. Just like Kṛṣṇa appears as hog, but that doesn't mean He's hog. Kṛṣṇa appears as fish. That does not mean He's fish. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (someone offers obeisances-end)</div>
