<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with French Nun<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>August 13, 1973, Paris</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She's asking... This is a French nun, and she wishes to know whether for us Christ is the son of God or is He God Himself or what is the identity of Lord Jesus Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jesus Christ says that he's son of God. That's all right. We accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates French throughout) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...ordinary son. And he's powerful son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...question. She asks what is the difference between our understanding of reincarnation and the Christian concept of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christ said he would come again. Is there a difference? Is it the same thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't find anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There was this gentleman this afternoon who was asking you about people who are constantly, constantly being tested by all kinds of miserable circumstances. She asks: Is it not a sign of a soul that God has chosen to favor that he sends them such miserable conditions of material life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Devotee, in miserable condition, they accept it as a favor of God. [break] ...in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tat te 'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇo<br class="calibre2"/>bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam<br class="calibre2"/>hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te<br class="calibre2"/>jīveta yo mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span> 10.14.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">We are put sometimes in difficult position. But a devotee takes the difficult position as mercy of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She, she asks you for an explanation of an event that happened to her sister. Her sister died at the age of five and a half years. And just before her death she apparently was able to explain some of her past lifetimes to her mother, that she had formerly been a princess or of noble birth and that now she was being called. Is there some explanation for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she remembers of her last birth. That is quite possible. Because we are changing body. So one who can remember about his past life, they are called <span class="Italic">jāta-smaraṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Jāta-smaraṇa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who can remember about his past life. [break] ...means forgetting everything of the past life. [break] ...times a person remembers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She asks for a definition of the word "occult." What is something that is occult, something occult or mystic? What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mystic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Mystic. What is mysticism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not say anything on mysticism. Mystic, something. It is called <span class="Italic">rahasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Rahasya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Rahasya.</span> Something wonderful. Is that meaning? Mystic</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Mystic... I mean. I think when Western historians and literators explain Indian religious literature, especially literature of <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga,</span> they term that those are the mystics and also they term the Sufi poets are mystics. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...say mystic means <span class="Italic">rahasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Rahasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Rahasya</span> means it is little difficult to understand. [break] Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: rahasyam, rahasyam etad uttamam. Rahasyam etad uttamam.</span> This <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the first-class mystic. <span class="Italic">Rahasyam etad uttamaṁ bhakto 'si me priyo 'si me</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Because you are My devotee, you are My dear friend, you'll understand." So mysticism is not understandable by common man. It requires a special qualification. Just like to understand. It is also mysticism. Understand, to understand God. This is also mystic. It is not understandable by ordinary man. (end)</div>
