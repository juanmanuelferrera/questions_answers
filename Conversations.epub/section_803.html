<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and these are.... You are being plundered. They are very expert in the plunder. But I thought, "Some Indians will help. He is also 'big belly,' you. It is simply in my eyes. I am the only fool." I criticize like that. Just see how much money they have taken. One day, they are charging ten rupees, and fifty men working, so all spoiled. This is going on all over. <span class="Italic">Baro baro baṅgole baro baro peṭ, lanka dingate mata kara het.</span> (?) Hm? [break] (Bengali) He did not take the cart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I took a jeep also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> The card. I got your passbook and deposit book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Baro baro pet.</span> How you are being looted. Just see. Farce. They are making farce and taking money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals. Don't you see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This was done since I left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I told that this is being farce, and somebody told me you have guaranteed. And the other day, when I was walking, I said, "This is going to be farce," and somebody told me, "They have guaranteed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Around the <span class="Italic">kuṇḍa,</span> around the tank, putting up there, <span class="Italic">paṇḍal.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Jayapatāka?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayapatāka Mahārāja. [break] ...almost sixty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty years, they could not do any of these books. And still they are envious. Within sixty years they could not attract any foreign student or any book published. And still, they are proud. They have got all the blessings of Bhaktisiddhānta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They cannot even attract Indian students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, how black snakes they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They do pretty good with old widows, however. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Getting a lot of flowers here, it seems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There must be always all full of flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very many flowers coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are maintaining big, big monkey. No <span class="Italic">matta het.</span>(?) That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Maintaining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Maintaining Hanuman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Well, they are feeling.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...if there is water. And if there is lowland, the whole water will go to the lowland. And that means you have two or three canals, there will be no more flood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you need the land to make the canals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Emergency <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You convince him like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> This is very clever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And factually we have to do that in order to check the flood. Make scheme like Europeans and Americans. Why you are thinking in terms of Indian plan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's been here a long time, Prabhupāda. (laughter) He's thinking like a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I am born here. I have no Indian plan. My plans are all American.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-krpa:</span> Your plans are Kṛṣṇa's plans, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. I planned that "I must go to America." Yes. That was the reason. Otherwise, generally they go to London. I did not go to London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were talking about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were just talking about that last night, that generally someone in Indian would think, "Let me go to London," but you thought, "Let me go to..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I was simply dreaming, "How to go to New York?" Actually I thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The biggest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was scheming, "Whether I shall go this way, through Tokyo, Japan, or that way? Which way is cheaper?" That was my plan. And I was targeting to New York always. Sometimes I was dreaming that I have come to New York. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Bengali ) (aside:) We cannot accept food from the demons. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...supplied at least nice food. [break] You are the first time here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...purify the whole atmosphere. [break] ...world we are all condemned. Still, Kṛṣṇa has given so many facilities. There is a Bengali proverb. <span class="Italic">Bondhīr astekur bhaga.</span>(?) <span class="Italic">Ast kur</span>(?) means the place of garbage. If a aristocrat asks that "You have to live in my garbage place," "Oh, that is also better." Similarly, Kṛṣṇa.... This is garbage. This material world is garbage. Still, we live so comfortably. Now just imagine what is His <span class="Italic">dhāma.</span> It is the garbage tank. Still so nice. And just think what is His real place, Goloka Vṛndāvana. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> ...gave us a very good record, very clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purest in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Officially, he said, the government is very eager to always keep an eye on your activities, but so far, you have not had any bad record. Therefore the government is favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise, how Indira Gandhi could see me? Even in the midst of crisis she gave me time. She has got very impression. She said that "I have all faith in you, but because I am afraid of the these Americans..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We understand how important it is to keep all our dealings in the open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes, very, very careful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Watching the dangers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got good reputation all over the world. The German rascals, they wanted to minimize our value, but he failed, that police officer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If the government sanctions for acquiring this land, then we won't have any trouble in Hyderabad getting that land either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Have to give it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...take it rightly. Then we'll lay down the foundation. Something, anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The subjects that we're going to be discussing today in the GBC meeting is about the role of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> and <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> in ISKCON. And in the Eighteenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in one of your purports, you say that a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should never discourage a young man from becoming, from getting married. But on the other hand, we have understood that a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should encourage young men to remain <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> So it seems to me like there's some kind of a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to time, circumstances. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">niyataṁ kuru karma tvam:</span> "Always be engaged in your prescribed work." And, at last, He says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now we have to adjust. That is not contradiction. That is suitable to the time and circumstance. <span class="Italic">Karma</span> is also recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas. Karma-kāṇḍa.</span> There are three divisions: <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kaṇḍa</span> and <span class="Italic">upāsanā-kāṇḍa.</span> <span class="Italic">Trayi.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is known as, what is called, trio. The trio word has come from <span class="Italic">"trayi."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> You have also said, regarding that, that Kṛṣṇa gives us the conclusion of the those three processes in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that <span class="Italic">karma</span> is concluded, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi [Bg. 9.27],</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is concluded, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is concluded <span class="Italic">yoginām api sarveṣām [Bg. </span>6.47]<span class="Italic">.</span> So is there some conclusive..., like Kṛṣṇa says, concluding, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> Is there some conc...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the real end. You have to become the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Either you go through <span class="Italic">karma</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> or <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> it doesn't matter. The ultimate aim is how to reach Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. [break] Arjuna achieved the favor of Kṛṣṇa by fighting, by killing. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
