<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The following is Śrīla Prabhupāda's morning walk which takes place in Melbourne, Australia, Botanical Gardens on May 22, 1975. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...the area since 1900.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> And he was telling me that the house that you are living in, Prabhupāda House, was built in 1885.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> 1885, and at that time it was the only house in the whole area for miles around. And it was built by one judge called Moritt(?), Judge Moritt(?). And it was the only house in... They called it "Moritt's folly," "Moritt's folly," because it was built on the sand, and no one thought it could stand for so long. It was built... Because this whole area here was sand, it was all beach, and it was the only house there, and he had stables and very extensive holdings there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Judge, he was judge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He was a judge, yes. He went to great extent to build the house. It was during this boom area when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Englishmen were coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yeah, the Englishmen were coming and because Queen Victoria was there..., the king had died, so the order was passed that no one could buy any, I think, jewelry for their wives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It was something. The English frowned upon buying jewelry and ornaments for the women. So the men were using their money to build big houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So therefore during the Victorian area, era you have many elaborate houses that were built by the Britishers. And he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Victoria died in 1903.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He was said to have brought some Italian plasterers from Italy to do all that elaborate work on the ceilings in the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So many people are anxious to come into the house to see the work in the construction of the house. And it has been classified as a building of national importance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. The building is known everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Oh yes. It is important building. They cannot... It is not allowed to be torn down. It is protected by the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Historical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Historical building. It is protected by the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yesterday you were telling Bhūrijana they should make the temple a tourist attraction. So with this method, it would be very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (coughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Roll down the window.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the demonic, they construct very nice house. [break] ...this planet, there are seven other planets. There sunshine does not go. But they are very well situated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well situated? Even though there's no sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but there are snakes which has got jewel on the head. That light keeps them illuminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But does that light also keep them healthy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Like the sun gives us, keeps us healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So the jewels from the snakes can also provide that nutrition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> So those snakes are very important. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...plans. They had to work very hard to find out, "What is this? What is this?" So that is described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Kliśyanti kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> "Working hard simply to know." <span class="Italic">Kliśyanti. Kliśyanti</span> means working very hard, labor. <span class="Italic">Kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> Simply to understand. But they are not <span class="Italic">kliśyanti</span> to understand God. <span class="Italic">Kliśyanti kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> This kind of knowledge is compared with beating the bush. That's all. After taking away the paddy grains, only the skin remains. And if you again beat the skin to get grains, that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Beating the husk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is like that. <span class="Italic">Kliśyanti kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> Prabhupāda, I have seen in New Zealand that the diary farmers they cut the tails off the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> The farmers have cut the tails off the cows in New Zealand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tails?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> Yeah, they cut the tails off so that when they're milking the tails won't hit them in the face. They do this to all their cows in the milking sheds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For what purpose? The tail, cut the tails?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> When you milk the cow, they sometimes hit you in the face with their tail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Sometimes it's very dangerous. They can hurt your eye or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> In New Vrindaban sometimes they tie it to the ceiling. But not cutting. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...comprised of spirit souls, unlimited amounts of shining spirit souls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Combination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Combination. Of something else besides...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impersonalists, they do not accept personal feature. Means they fall down again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That means there must be a lot of impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It seems there would be a lot of impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, more than them, there are personalists. They are in Vaikuṇṭhaloka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 3:</span> [break] ...in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 3:</span> Is there any real happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material world, no happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 4:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the advantage of going to India, to Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 4:</span> What is the advantage of going...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To get impetus to go back to home, back to Godhead. To come to Australia we get impetus to go to hell. (laughter) [break] Hell means anywhere where material happiness is given more importance. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sevāṁ dvā r a m āhur vimuktes tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgi...</span> In the western countries and..., they are simply busy in sense gratification. So that is the way of hell. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 5:</span> ...said that "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 5:</span> You have said, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God." Well, um, what I want to know is, is not God eternal, therefore how was there a beginning? And if the beginning was the word, who was it spoken by or how was it spoken if it was the beginning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? In the beginning there was word. So what is the difficulty to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span>. He's saying if everything is eternal, then how was there a beginning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beginning of this material world. This material world has beginning and end. Just like this material season, it has beginning and end. Hm. This is troublesome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Garland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> There should be flowers all over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> To make you garlands. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This beginning and end, that is troublesome. So in the material body, it has beginning and end. Therefore it is... But they do not understand it. They think, "It is all right." I don't want to end this body but there is end. Neither I want to begin, but there is beginning. That is the trouble. But we are so dull-headed, we do not understand that anything which has beginning and end, that is troublesome. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate: [Bg. </span>8.19] "It begins and ends." That requires intelligence, that "I am eternal. Why should I accept anything which has beginning and end?" That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 6:</span> Was there a time when there was no material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 6:</span> Was there a time when there was no material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The material world in potency is always there. But it has got a manifestation, beginning, and again end. It begins from God, and again it ends in God. But God is eternal. [break] ...feeling of your, it is manifested, and sometimes it is not manifested. But the feeling potency is there. Just like sometimes I become angry and sometimes not angry, but the potency of becoming angry is there. That is eternal. Similarly, the material world, the material energy, or the material nature, is permanent, but it is sometimes manifest, sometimes not manifest. It is now manifest. It will end. Again, another body you will manifest, and it will end. But I am eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? The spirit is supposed to be stronger than matter. The spirit is superior than matter. So it seems that... Well, what happens when the body dies? Is the spirit forced to leave or does it leave on its own accord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is by nature forced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But that is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Isn't nature material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, material nature, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So how is material forcing something spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have voluntarily accept her supremacy. Just like you have accepted some disease. So disease is forcing you. And if you cure, then it will not be able to force you. You infect some disease. Then you become forced by the disease to accept the miseries. But if you are not diseased, there is no question of force. If you become criminal, the police forces you. And if you are not criminal you have no business with the police. It is like this. Police control, controller-the controlling power upon me comes when I am criminal. Otherwise why police will control me? Therefore I voluntarily accept the control of police by my criminal desires. That is going on. That is material life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But would that mean that a person who is a pure devotee doesn't have to die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, die... Pure or nonpure, nobody dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Though his material body dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But a pure devotee goes back to home. There is no more material body. That is the... So we are advocating that you come to this stage where you will not to have accept this material body. Then you are really happy. And if you want to enjoy the flickering, illusory <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then you are subjected to the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You are enjoying as American. Then you enjoy as a dog. That is <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> control. But if you don't enjoy material things then you become purified. You come to the eternal life, back to home, back to Godhead. But they are not willing to give up this material enjoyment. That is the defect. So it requires education. It requires knowledge. It requires training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 7:</span> Prabhupāda, when you leave this material world, will there be another spiritual master after you? Another pure soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that spiritual master is Kṛṣṇa Himself. There is no need of education. Everyone is free. Everyone is full knowledge. There is no need of spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 8:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, many people who live outside the temple have Jagannātha Deities and Gaura-Nitāi Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 8:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, many people who live outside the temple have Jagannātha Deities and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better Gaura-Nitāi Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 8:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better Gaura-Nitāi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 8:</span> So they have to do full Deity worship when they have these Deities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 8:</span> They have to do full Deity worship to have these Deities? Dress the Deities every day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are supposed to do so, but whether they are able to do so, that is the point. If you can worship properly, that's all right. But whether you are able to worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 7:</span> Prabhupāda, can a person go back to a spiritual planet without initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 7:</span> Can a person go back to a spiritual planet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no more init... Initiation here required when the living entity is in darkness. Just like uneducated person requires to go to school. One who is educated, in his full knowledge, he doesn't go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The question was, Prabhupāda, is it possible for a person to return to the spiritual world without taking initiation from a bona fide spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible. Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī said, <span class="Italic">ā dau gurv-āśrayam.</span> First business is to accept spiritual master. <span class="Italic">Ā dau gurv-āśrayam.</span> Who will train him? He is already fool, rascal. He must be trained up. So he must be trained up by the representative of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 9:</span> Is second initiation necessary, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Second or first only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 9:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what are you saying? You said before there's no necessary for a spiritual master and now you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> He said in the spiritual world there is no necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 9:</span> Oh, in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Everyone is in full knowledge. In the material world everyone is in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda! <span class="Italic">Hari bol! Hari bol!</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it appears that there is a group of persons here in Australia who think, judging from the different questions that are being asked, they are thinking that it is not required to formally accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many rascal swamis come. They say like that, "There is no need of guru."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 1:</span> Yeah, right. They think that Kṛṣṇa is in the heart and you can accept initiation by that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know where to find out Kṛṣṇa in the heart. (end)</div>
