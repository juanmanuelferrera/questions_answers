<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this paper should be carried to Pradyumna. [break] ...predicted it? They are not going to do all this protest against Transcendental Meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means here they are feeling the weight. You see? These protests, this combination, this endeavor to collapse our..., that means they are feeling more weight. And what is this movement, Transcendent...? They never formed against any case, anything, Transcendental... They know that is farce. There are so many other groups. Yogi Bhajan, Transcendental Meditation and what is he? Guru...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Guru Maharaji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru Maharaja. So many. Ramakrishna is not very prominent. Sai Baba. (aside:) Little, little, everyone. Who asked for them? Aurobindo. Even Aurobindo. Who will protest against Aurobindo? Aurobindo has got some influence in the Western...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Not so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I never heard of him before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) I never heard of Aurobindo. If someone is interested in Eastern philosophy, generally they read books about Aurobindo and stuff like that, because up till now that's been the only literature that's been available in the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. People like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now it is worthless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now it's finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's one other movement called the Moonies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Moonies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Moonies. That's been founded by Reverend Sun Yung Moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That Korean man, that Korean businessman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. But that is also not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're big in the States. They're very big in the States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He wants to take over the world. He publicly says so. He claims to be organizing the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He says that Jesus never carried out what he intended to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I am doing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So he's going to come and do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is capturing the sentiment. There is no philosophy. And who cares for Jesus? First of all they must care for Jesus. So he's... He has got any books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I don't think so. Maybe some pamphlets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No one's got any literature like yours. At the most, they can produce a few pamphlets. They can't even produce one volume the size of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> what to speak of eighty. And if they could, no one would read them anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, on the whole there is now attempt to stop this movement. [break] ...but in... We have made so many court cases. Now, only loss we are feeling now-in some airports they have stopped our book selling. So formerly also, they were stopped and again revived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Legally we haven't been stopped in any airport, I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Legally we have been stopped?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In Los Angeles, in Dallas and Atlanta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Legally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But that's only temporarily, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It's a constant struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Struggle must be there. You cannot stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In Montreal for about two years...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa, since His birth struggled. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We had harassment from the police in Montreal for two years. Sometimes they even beat up the devotees. They have put them into jail...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have beaten even our book sellers in airports.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Chicago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> And the police mistreat the devotees. But still, the devotees continue and now in Montreal there's no trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They crucified Jesus, what to speak of devotees. Prahlāda Mahārāja was persecuted, Haridāsa Ṭhākura. I think I shall not go to Europe, America, for some time. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not unless this gets cleared up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is being discussed about me. They say, "Old man is behind this movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even in Australia now they're having the same thing, kidnapping and everything. It's everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are feeling the weight. It is spreading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah. (end)</div>
