<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still, if you say, "You are <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span>" they become angry. Such <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> rascals, they are in the government service. And if you say that "You are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span>" he becomes angry. <span class="Italic">Upadeśo hi mūrkhāṇāṁ prakopāya na śāntaye:</span> "If a <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> is advised nice instruction, he becomes angry." He does not take it. <span class="Italic">Payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam:</span> "If you give milk and banana to a snake, you simply increase his poison." One day he will come-(growls). You see? "I have given you milk and you..." "Yes, that is my nature. Yes. You give me milk, and I am prepared to kill you." This is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> We have to kill this civilization of <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. <span class="Italic">Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are actually human being, you have to give them Kṛṣṇa. And those who are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> we have to kill them. This is our business. Kill all the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> and give Kṛṣṇa to the sane man. Yes. That will prove that you are really Kṛṣṇa's. We are not nonviolent. We are violent to the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> [break] ...wal, did you come here before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you like this place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> It's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...here for some time. You'll like it very much. [break] ...you all that in this center very nice foodstuff is supplied, and nobody becomes sick. Everyone complain, "I am sick because I am eating too much," or "no eating." Why? No eating or eating too much should be avoided. Simply you eat what will keep your health nice. That is eating. No eating is also not advised, and overeating is also not. <span class="Italic">Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca. Yuktāhāra-vihārasya [NoI 2]. Yuktāhāra,</span> not <span class="Italic">atyāhāra. Yukta.</span> Where is this Śāstrī? He's sleeping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was in the class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he doesn't sleep at this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...possible for us to challenge the whole world that "You are all fools." Huh? Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Based on the scripture. You can show Vedic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they don't care for Vedic. That is another foolishness. You have to present. You have to prove them fools by practical. And otherwise, "Who cares for your Vedic instruction?" they will say. Why they should... "We have got our own instruction." That is preaching. If you quote simply Vedic literature, they will think, "We can quote many others."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> But they are filled with anxiety and we are not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> They are filled with anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the way of presentation. You have to present in such a way that he will accept that "What you are saying, you are right." That is preaching. [break] ...cepting our books because they are seeing, "Yes, here is practical explanation," not that because it is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> What do they care for <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They never heard of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. And why they should accept <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>? We are not accepting Bible, so why they should accept <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>? That is no argument. You must present the Vedic knowledge in such a way that they will be obliged to accept: "Yes, it is right." [break] ...something, Mr. Agarwal, that "Nobody complains about eating," you will do a great service, I tell you. Everyone will come and say, "Oh, such a nice food." They will come here for eating, if not for anything. [break] You were proposing about our Vṛndāvana. So if this thing is done, that the eatables are very nice, then visitors will come. Otherwise this manager, that manager, this manager will not help you. <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There are a lot of restaurants in America which are very far away from the general mass of people, and because they have very high reputations, people come from miles around there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This tongue is very, what is called? Susceptible? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Voracious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not voracious. They want very palatable things, the tongue. <span class="Italic">Tā'ra madhye jihwā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati,</span> very greedy. So if you supply them <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasādam</span> at the same time to satisfy their greediness, then you conquer. This is the secret.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You conquered a lot of devotees by <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes. Automatically he becomes devotee: "No, we shall become, remain here." This is the secret. Why the woman is liked? Because the woman, if she is trained up to give satisfaction to the tongue, to the belly and the sex, straight line, she becomes favorite immediately. This is woman's business. And people are hankering. The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> especially, they are hankering after these three things: palatable dishes, fill up belly, and sex. That's all. If the woman can do it, she conquers over the husband immediately because these three things they want. Take things very practically. Hm? Am I wrong or right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You are always right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. <span class="Italic">Tā'ra madhye jīhwā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā'ke jetā kaṭhina saṁsāre, kṛṣṇa baṛo doyāmoy, koribāre jihwā jay, swa-prasād.</span> So <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> should be so nice that he'll (be) conquered. He'll not go to the restaurant; they will come to Māyāpura. I have seen in Japan. Who is? You were... Where you were staying, that place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Which place, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, far away from the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Oh, yes, yes. Takal, outside of Tokyo, we had our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there were hotels?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. Yes. One bird restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, bird. They are coming from fifty miles to eat there. So eating is so strong. If you prepare nice foodstuff and the flavor goes to hundred miles away, then they will automatically come. This is practical. Only for satisfaction of the tongue, there were special buses bringing them, and they were coming, full load of bus, to eat that jungle birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Jungle birds. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The birds are available in the city, the fowls and cocks, but they wanted to eat the jungle birds. Just like there are men. They get sex pleasure at home; still, they go to the prostitutes. Very beautiful wife, but he goes to the prostitute. Taste is such bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like Ajāmila. Ajāmila.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He had very good wife, young wife, and he became a victim to a prostitute and lost all brahminical culture. So if you create prostitute in the society, where is the hope of brahminical culture? There is a story that a gentleman... Not gentleman, a rascal. He was rich, and he was going to the prostitute. So the wife inquired that "What is wanting in me that you are going to the prostitute?" You know that story? "No, I go there because she dances, sings." So she learned dancing. So in this way, one after another, drinking, dancing, this, that. Still, he was going. The wife learned everything. Then when she said, "Now I have learned whatever you wanted. Still why you are...?" "No, one thing. I cannot express that." "What is that?" "You do not abuse my father and mother. That you cannot do." These prostitutes, they abuse the father and mother. In Bengal it is known, <span class="Italic">rakta kedara vega.</span>(?) They address like that. Then she said, "All right. Stop. I am no more your wife. I cannot abuse your father and mother. That is not possible. I have learned everything for your satisfaction, but I cannot learn this thing." The prostitute will not only abuse the paramour but his father, mother, family, everything, culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he enjoys it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he enjoys: "Oh, so kindly she is abusing. It is love."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means completely perverted enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] They are being watered regularly, eh? [break] ...the neighbors, they do not like to sell, so don't bother. Let them keep it green. We shall see it. While walking we shall see all green at their expense. (laughter) Don't be eager to purchase. Just see. As soon as we began this digging, immediately he came down one thousand. And if you really purchase, he'll come and give at three thousand dollars. And he was asking six thousand. They came to seek some service. If it is possible, then give them, engage them. They said, "You are giving employment, so many." Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They can carry sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They can carry sand by bullock cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's got a bullock cart and a nice house. He is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If possible, engage him in some permanent work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was a good friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And then also, see... Engage that Ghosh also, who sold us... Kappa Ghosh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They all want to carry sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They all want to carry sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No. Jagad Ali also will take a permanent work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that sand we shall do because our work should go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Kappa Ghosh never sold us any land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He never sold us any land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that land you said, told me, some Ghosh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That was Balai Gosh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But Kappa Gosh is... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...bring these people into, all Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They may go under the banner of Muslim and so many other things, but actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By association. If the devotees are real devotees, then by their association they will become devotees. <span class="Italic">Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.</span> What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ saṅgāt sañjāyate... Dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that verse, Śāstrījī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Second Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>saṅgas teṣūpajāyate<br class="calibre2"/>saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kāmāt krodho 'bhijāyate</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the material side. Similarly, spiritual side also, the same. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga</span> is there, then gradually he becomes a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> [break] ...looking for a job. He worked for two months and then became devotee. He never took even salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce [Cc. Madhya 22.42].</span> This is the process. If one comes in contact with devotee or God, then he is simply satisfied by the service. No return. <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce.</span> [break] ...guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, these workers are coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ghosh wanted to give us land that side for making a path to the Ganges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Sell us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. So we have got a plan beginning from this gate up to the Ganges. If we get land we can do that. [break] Foundation stone in Nellore can be transferred to Madras?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's what I'm going to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Madras is far better place than Nellore. [break] ...if we take charity from such fallen woman, then we have to share his sinful activity. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we should be careful from whom we accept charity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But our Kṛṣṇa can eat even fire. If there is forest fire, Kṛṣṇa can eat. Unless He is able to eat others' sinful reaction, how He says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]? He is capable; otherwise how He can say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> <span class="Italic">Sva-rakṣita rakṣati yo hi garbhe.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Ask the grill men to come and prepare grills for all the windows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Is that... Tamāla Kṛṣṇa's money can be used for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You simply give him account. You will get as much money as you require. [break] ...think that you must be assured that it is going to be finished before the festival. Otherwise don't engage so many men uselessly. Take assurances that it will be finished. Then make so many people engaged. Otherwise there is no need. Only fifty men is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember with the first building what we did is with the contractor, the labor contractor, we held back a little bit of his money on the guaranteed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> These are not contractors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Contractor or no contractor, but you be assured. Otherwise don't engage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He said we can finish all the brick work in two weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't not know what they say, but I want finished within two months. Then engage so many men. Otherwise why you are uselessly...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Six weeks left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if they cannot assure that, then keep only fifty men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We can get everything finished except for the plumbing and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No "except."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So then it is not possible. I can't do plumbing until everything is finished. Then only I can do the plumbing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far plumbing, of course, not very important. That can be done later on. They can use other...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Neighbor's land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is not... But this must be habitable. Otherwise what is the use of engaging so many men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about electricity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Electricity is no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Electricity also can be temporarily, immediately fixed up. That is not difficult. [break] ...saying that "Our work will go on." If you cheat us in this way, then I will not engage you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we have ten years' work to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you must finish everything within that period. Plumbing and electricity we shall see. That is not very important. But it must be habitable. So if he thinks that it is possible, then let him go. Otherwise you engage only fifty men. [break] ...he cannot say, "There was no money." That is not possible. If you pay money, he must give the result. (end)</div>
