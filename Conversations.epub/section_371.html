<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...every <span class="Italic">payasā</span> you should spend for Kṛṣṇa. Not that "Kṛṣṇa is giving money. Let us squander it as much as we like." Then there will be scarcity. [break] What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This is a short cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, all right. [break] <span class="Italic">...pūjyante dhanya yatra sucancitam</span> (?), "Where a rascal is not worshiped, where foodstuff is kept very carefully," and <span class="Italic">dam-patyoḥ kalaha nāsti,</span> "and when there is no fight between husband and wife, or family-wise," <span class="Italic">tatra śrīḥ svayam āgataḥ,</span> "there goddess of fortune is always present." Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the principle given by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, the greatest politician and moralist. <span class="Italic">Mūrkha</span> means who is not pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He's a <span class="Italic">mūrkha</span> or <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Not that ABCD learned. ABCD learned is no use. And another <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says who is learned man. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu:</span> "One who does not think of any illicit sex life." <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat...</span> Every woman-mother. Except his married wife, every woman is mother. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-loṣṭravat</span> "And others' money, just like garbage." Nobody touches. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat,</span> and <span class="Italic">ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu:</span> "And one who sees like himself all other living entities, he's <span class="Italic">paṇḍita,</span> he's learned." Not by MA, Ph.D. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] <span class="Italic">...yaḥ paśyati. Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...nihāram iva bhā...</span> It is called <span class="Italic">nihāra.</span> As long, as soon as the sun becomes strong, immediately, everything finished. Just see. This... What is called fog, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Just like when you came to the West, Prabhupāda, you cleared away the fog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, I tried for that. Whatever is done it is done by Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...keeps intelligent to the sincere servant. Otherwise, everything is done by Kṛṣṇa. So if you, one is sincere to Kṛṣṇa, he will act everything rightly because the direction is... <span class="Italic">Buddhi yogaṁ dadāmi tam.</span> The perfect direction is there. I do not know why people denies to take direction from Kṛṣṇa. He gets perfect direction. But he does not like to take. What is this tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The <span class="Italic">imli,</span> I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Imli.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Not <span class="Italic">imli?</span> They call that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not <span class="Italic">imli. Imli's</span> different. This way, up to that river? [break] <span class="Italic">...vāsudeva-parāyaṇa. Vāsudeva-parāyaṇa,</span> means Kṛṣṇa conscious person, they solve all questions by one thing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Exactly like the sun solves all the problems of this <span class="Italic">nihāra,</span> foss. It is called foss?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Fog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Mist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nihāram iva bhāskara.</span> Let the scientists do it in their scientific way, drive away the fog. Is there any process? Eh? In the ocean, when there is fog like this, they have to stop all the ships and cry, (makes sound like fog horn:) onnnh, onnnh, so that they may not collide. I have seen it when I was coming, going to USA. Where is Mohanānanda? He is here? No. Mohanānanda? Hare Kṛṣṇa. The difference between other camps and our: they call these men from their daily, I mean to say, life, householder's life, for this purpose for a week or so, but they are not dedicated. Here, in our camp, all our people are dedicated to the cause. That is the difference. So they cannot surpass your activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Because you are dedicated, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone should be dedicated, I or you. Does not... That is the success of life. Dedicate your life for Kṛṣṇa. That is the perfection. Even there are some faults, even dedicated life is noble life. Maybe, due to our past habits, we may commit some faulty action, but that dedicated life is sublime. <span class="Italic">Api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This, from this... This is the land that we want to get. It starts from here. And that's our land there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...immediately appreciates Kṛṣṇa's intelligence. <span class="Italic">Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svā-bhāvikī... [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span> It is being done as if automatically, but no, there is brain. That brain, these rascals, they cannot find out. Machine, nature only. What is this nature? Nonsense. So which way we shall go? This way? Up to the river?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Each and every grain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Here's our mango tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Mango.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mango tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, we planted, uh... (end)</div>
