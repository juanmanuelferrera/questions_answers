<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Italic">(kīrtana</span> in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...was sitting previously, which was being worshiped at this place. So he sat down because he was thinking that he was good as standing up, same as standing up. So one Vaiṣṇava priest who was taking care of the place, he threw him out. So in the book they complained that the Vaiṣṇavas are considered to be very narrow-minded (laughter). Now I can understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here. He was kicked out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, the boy threw him out. So they were complaining about this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. How bogus he was. No, when I go to met in Hollywood that, in the beginning that Prabhavananda, the rascal said that "Ramakrishna was formerly Caitanya Mahāprabhu." He began like that. Then I could understand "What a rascal he is, and I have to waste my time." So I did not answer anything. I said, "Thank you very much for your meeting," and I went out. This Ramakrishna rascal's first proposal was that Ramakrishna Thakura was formerly Caitanya. This is beginning. He was so rascal. (pause) (sounds of massage?) This is framework house. If some of the swamis may have said, they say that "Why you call us rascal and so many things?" So you say that "We are not calling you. Kṛṣṇa says. So we are pushing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we have to repeat what Kṛṣṇa has said. That's it. We cannot help it. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious; therefore you must be <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The best thing Kṛṣṇa has to say about them is that they are <span class="Italic">abuddhayaḥ.</span> The best thing Kṛṣṇa says about them is they are unintelligent. <span class="Italic">Avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ manyante mām abuddhayaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg.<i class="calibre3"> </i>7.24]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Abuddhayaḥ,</span> no intelligence. And similarly, those who are demigod-worshipers, they have been described, <span class="Italic">naṣṭa-buddhayaḥ,</span> "lost of intelligence." These are statements in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness; we have to say. How we can avoid this? It may be displeasing to you, but we are not... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> We are not sorry. No, I mean to say the other party. But we have to say it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee (2):</span> No, they all very pleased. They are all very pleased there. I say, when you can get off and Prabhupāda again comes, take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> you can get off on that. They are waiting, but they will not take <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> unless Prabhupāda's... They are about, oh, about two hundred people nowadays. This temple here, all garden full?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they liked, but I spoke very strong thing against Ramakrishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Because you spoke the truth, facts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I challenged that "Any question? Please come." Dr. Kapoor says that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> O.B.L. Kapoor? Vṛndāvana...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana, yes. That "Bhaktivedanta Swami speaks as strongly as Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was speaking." You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Oh, yes. I met so many times. I understand also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Very nice compliment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> He also said that "Śrīla Prabhupāda is only one who has really taken the, his mission seriously."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. Of course, I don't say myself. That will not look good, but there is other... They, all my Godbrothers, realize it. "But he is only representative." Somebody, they frankly admit, and somebody do not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> I met... Some they are starting coming here to see how the things are. (laughs) They all came. Still they are coming. I think... Somebody said that Bon Mahārāja came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Not here. I mean in London. Not here, I never invite anybody, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. London he came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Yes I heard. I don't know. Somebody was telling. And so many swamis, so many, from Vṛndāvana they are coming. Because many, many guests come, Prabhupāda, in the weekend or during the day. They tell me that "Would you like to go? Some swami has come, some..." "Our swami is already here." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> They invite some invitation. They have had a big international religious conference in Millford a few weeks back, and all the professors, universities and big, big shark(?) have got... And I understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> (laughs) <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas,</span> yes. So I understand... Some of the friends said it was a big feast and all that, but there was nothing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They never talk about the Lord. They were simply arguing each other, "I think so." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Big, big professor from the university, from Glasgow, so many professors. Big pamphlet came to me. They all sent to... They sent it to this place here. I don't know from where they get the address or the name all that, and they sent, many, many of these new societies. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep our standard. Then everyone will give assistance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> We got many times, many visitors here. One time that church come here to see how things are. Chinese people came, Englishmen. One of the lady, not very far from here, she came one morning, said "My brother is in the hospital, and he is very sick. I know you are a pious people. Can you pray for him?" And "You pray the Lord. You come here. Lord is here." And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Not very far from here. Said, "We hear the noise in the morning, and we have got these feelings that these are very good thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, this was an English person who came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> English, yes. She is feeling in the heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> I... We can. By your grace, Kṛṣṇa is here, and we have no intention to come from there. I had intention that let the children go back home. And we fight, all this stuff. I say, "All right, we must start to fully educate him." Full education is that he become advanced in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> So I said "We haven't got any education." Under the law of this country, if they have to remain here, they have to go up to sixteen years to the school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, education is good, but the association is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> No, they don't have any asso... They don't go anywhere. They don't eat anywhere. Even so many invitations come, either they go to the library or they go to the temple or this place. They have no friends, nothing else. They don't even take the water anywhere, even to my brother's house. They don't take anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your brother is also here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Yes, he's here. And he was not very good terms last eight years with me. But when I established this temple, by your grace, Prabhupāda, he has also realized it now that this is good. And my difference with him was that "You should give up this nonsense of drinking this, all these things." That was only..., nothing else, about money or anything. I say, "I cannot eat at your place unless you give up these things." I go there, don't eat anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still, he drinks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Still he drinks. That is the fact. He doesn't eat meat, of course, but he says... He has got good business, plenty of money. I am poor materially, but my father, spiritual father, is so rich that I am getting money every day. Materially, I am poor, but I am so richer, you are giving so treasure... You see in our library there each and every of your book downstairs, and more we read, we say, well plenty money is... [break] ...from the temple. Life member comes there, sell the Gujarati magazine. I bought all magazines from Gujarati. Now second issue has not come. The same problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is, have printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> But whatever I brought, it went within two, three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Yaśomatīnandana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> (Hindi) ...that "The next issue is in the press, and I'll soon send." And Gopāla dāsa I also written. Because there are many Gujaratis here, and they are becoming life members... They are helping very much. Anybody comes here, we send out to the Manor. I say, "Here Kṛṣṇa is... Here we are. Here we have got everything by Kṛṣṇa's grace, and all the help should go to this center."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are preparing something of bitter melon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Bitter? You mean the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karelās,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> How much is left?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> No, no, we just starting it. Prabhupāda approved that, starting, starting with two chapters three times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can do one thing. Part by part, you publish in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-darśana</span> so that he can, everyone can see how it is. Then it will be good.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Oh, yes. No, I showed to Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Prabhu when he came here. He also came here. He came one day here, so I showed all these and I read little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gopāla Kṛṣṇa himself is not very expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> No. So I said that "Śrīla Prabhupāda is coming now," so if you get a chance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say that whatever you have written, let it be published in the... So that everyone can see. Then we can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> So I will send to India chapter by chapter, and they can publish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With a letter that "Prabhupāda says like this, that you print in the Hindi edition of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-darśana</span> so that everyone will see, and will judge how it is done nicely."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Should I make this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> I'll send first chapter complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Duplicate it and keep one copy with me here and one copy send off, and they can publish in the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficulty is that in India, in different parts of India different standard. Somebody says, "This standard is good"; somebody says, "This standard is good."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Well, we are not worried about the criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> We are not worried about the criticism, anybody say. What you say we'll take that one line, the guide line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not authority in Hindi, but this Hindi, different parts of India, a different standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Yes, that's true. That is why I had not depend on myself. It going from the four people different, one after another, and they are qualified Sanskrit and Hindi scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Let it be published.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Complete corrections also. It's not going by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can show me some samples which you have completed. Yes, you can show me some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, devotees are asking can you take <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> and go to manor? There's some press coming, but without you they're... Is it all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. All right. I will take some time. I ordered...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Others, they are also waiting. Indians, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them all take. You can also go down. [break] (Prabhupāda moves outside)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> ...and translate into English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Do it. You do. Give him the book. Simply book. Why you are taking the...? Yes. (Indian man speaking in Hindi about "Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness" for several minutes)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (Hindi) Should I read the translation in Hindi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can explain this. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṣīrodakaśāyī:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata<br class="calibre2"/>kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yat taj jñānaṁ mataṁ mama</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Kṛṣṇa has spoken about the <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña. Kṣetrajña</span> means the knower of the body, as He has already explained, that "I know that this is my finger." I never say, "I finger." So this body is <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña,</span> the field of activities, and the soul is the proprietor or worker within the body. That is called <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña.</span> This is already explained. He tried to explain... Because there are many ladies, so he tried to explain in Hindi. So here in the next verse Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi:</span> "I am also <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña.</span> I am also one of the knower of the body." So what is the difference between the one <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña</span> already explained, the soul, and this <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña,</span> Kṛṣṇa? What is the difference between the two? That is explained here. Kṛṣṇa says that "I am also <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña.</span>"<span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata:</span> "But the distinction is that the individual soul is situated in that particular body, but I am situated in every body, all-pervading." Sometimes they commit mistake that <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> and Paramātmā, they are the same, but that is not the fact. Here Kṛṣṇa explains very distinctly that "I am also <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> but I am Paramātmā." That is the distinction between God and ourselves. When Arjuna understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he addressed Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">. Paraṁ brahma.</span> They are anxious to realize Brahman, that I... <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi</span> does not mean that "I am Paraṁ Brahman." "I am individual part and parcel of Brahman." Similarly, <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> Paramātmā; <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> Parameśvara. We should understand this distinction between <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> Paramātmā: Brahman, Parabrahman; <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> Parameśvara. So in the Vedic literature it is said, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">. Īśvara. Īśvara</span> means controller. Every one of us, we are controller, either I control over my family or in my office or in my country. In this way everyone is a controller. I may be a controller. Not may be. In my limited jurisdiction I am also controller. You are also controller. So I may be a little greater controller, you may be a smaller controller and somebody may be greater than me. So in this way, if you study controllers, different types of controllers, you'll find there is junior and senior. The same person is senior controller in the family, but in the office he's a junior controller. The same person is junior and senior at the same time. Somewhere he is junior, somewhere he is senior. In this way, if you study all different types of controller, you'll see there is duality of controls, but when you approach somebody that He's simply controller-He's not controlled by others-that is Kṛṣṇa. This is analytical study of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So they have studied all these Vedic scholars, especially Lord Brahmā. This is the statement of Lord Brahmā. Not only Lord Brahmā, Vyāsadeva, Nārada and recently big, big <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka, Viṣṇu Svāmī, even Śaṅkarācārya and latest, five hundred years ago, Lord Caitanya-everyone has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the supreme controller. And in the dictionary you'll find... What is religion? Religion means to accept a supreme controller. That is religion. So in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> also it is said, <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">. Dharma</span> means the controlling laws given by God. That is called <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> So real <span class="Italic">dharma...</span> From all Vedic scriptures, from the version of all authorities, it is confirmed that <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">:</span> "Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means that we are presenting Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Every religion has conception of God, but no religious system in this world has got any clear conception of God. But in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement it is not actually a so-called religious movement, but it is an educational movement to give information to the human society about God, that "Here is God." You are searching after God, and somebody, in disappointment saying that "God is dead." God is neither dead, nor it is fictitious, but it is factual, and here is this God, Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the verdict of the Vedic literature. There may be many other gods. They are expansions of the original Personality of Godhead. If anyone is interested to study the science of God, you'll find it in the Vedic literature, how Kṛṣṇa expands by His plenary portion in different names of God. It is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span> That Absolute Truth is <span class="Italic">advaita,</span> without any duality; <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> infallible. <span class="Italic">Advaita, acyuta, anādi.</span> Everything has got it's beginning, anything you... That is our material conception because we have got the experience-anything we take, it has got a beginning. But Kṛṣṇa, He is described, <span class="Italic">advaita, acyuta, anādi:</span> "He has no beginning." And in another place it is also said,</div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Kāraṇam is the beginning. So just like my father is the cause of my personality; father, his father is the cause of his personality. In this way you try to find out the cause of the cause. You'll find Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything must be caused by something. Cause and effect. So the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> gives the verdict that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes.</div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">So this institution, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we have started. Now we have opened this center. I am very glad that you are coming here, but study the science of Kṛṣṇa. Don't remain blind. The science of Kṛṣṇa means science of God. The human life is meant for understanding the science of God. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> "This human form of life is meant for inquiring about the Absolute Truth-Brahman." That Brahman, Parabrahman, is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, when Arjuna studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> his conclusion was... He addressed immediately, "Kṛṣṇa," <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">. Bhavān.</span> "Yourself..." So don't waste your time even by a minute. Try to understand the science of Kṛṣṇa. That is the only business. Other business, they are subsidiary. They are not very important business. Why Kṛṣṇa understanding is important business? Because it will give you liberation from this material condition life. We are foolishly thinking we are very independent, we can do whatever we like, but that is not the fact. The fact is we are completely dependent on the laws of material nature. Even if you defy a little bit, immediately you'll be punished. That is the strict laws of nature. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we do not understand. There is no education throughout the whole world how we are being controlled by the material nature and why we are being controlled. Why we are put into this position of being controlled? These questions should be raised. That is human life. Otherwise it is animal life. The cats and dogs, they cannot inquire, "Why I am being controlled?" But they agree to be controlled. But human life there is struggle. They are called struggle for existence. They are trying to overcome the control of material nature by so-called scientific method, but that is not the way. You cannot do that. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like their so-called scientific way. They are trying to go to the moon planet or Mars planet. Why they are trying to go? Because they are controlled. They have got their flying machine. They can to go any planet, but they cannot because they are being controlled. So we should come to our senses that we cannot bring the laws of material nature under our control. We are already under the control of the laws of material nature, and that is our conditional life. Actually, we require freedom from conditional life, but that freedom can be achieved when we surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī<br class="calibre2"/>mama māyā duratyayā<br class="calibre2"/>mām eva ye prapadyante<br class="calibre2"/>māyām etāṁ taranti te<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.14]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">If you actually want to be not to be controlled by the laws of material nature, that you can do. That is possible. And that is possible simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa. So we are presenting this philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not a manufactured thing. We are quoting from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the same thing. We are not presenting something manufactured. There is no need, because things in perfection is already there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> There is no need of manufacturing by fools and rascals. There is no need. Everything is there in perfection. Simply we have to accept it and apply it in practical life. Then our life will be successful. Simply we have to understand it. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is... Then <span class="Italic">jānāti tattvataḥ,</span> anyone who is able to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, then what is the result? The result is <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya: [Bg. </span>4.9] "Such person, after giving up this body, he does not accept another material body." At the present moment we are giving up one material body and accepting another material body. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is our conditional life, but we are kept in such dense darkness of knowledge that we are thinking that "We are free. We can do whatever we like." This is very dangerous civilization-no knowledge of the spiritual life, no knowledge how the soul is transmigrating from one body to another, no knowledge what is the future, no knowledge what is the goal of life. Simply like cats and dogs, you dance, eat, drink, be merry and die, that's all. This is not good life. You must be very serious, especially those who are Indians. They should take it very seriously. Because this Kṛṣṇa culture, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> was spoken in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra in India, and we Indians, we do not take full advantage of this great transcendental knowledge, then you are committing suicide. So my request is, all the Indians who are here in this foreign country, keep your own original culture. Don't forget. Don't be bewildered. Be in your position. Try to under... It is very easy. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not at all difficult to understand, and we have tried to explain as easy as possible, not that we have deviated from the original verse, just like others do it. We do not do that; there is no need. That is another blunder. We keep <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and we still try to explain it. So I am very glad that you are all coming regularly, but take it. At least one day, this Sunday, you devote, seriously studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and discuss amongst you whenever there is any doubt. There cannot be any doubt. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> verses are so plainly explained, and... Just like here is one verse. We are trying to read. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata:</span> "My dear Arjuna..." Arjuna is addressed as Bhārata. Because he belongs to the dynasty of Bharata, sometimes he's addressed as Bhārata. So, very easy, that "I am also one of the souls. There are two souls. One, you are, and another, I am. So what is the difference between you and me?" That you know simply everything, not everything, but to some extent, about your body, but I know everything of everyone's body. That is the difference. I know the pleasure and pains of my body, you know the pleasure and pains of your body, but Kṛṣṇa knows the pleasure and pains of your body and pleasure and pains of my body. That is the difference between Kṛṣṇa and ourself. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> Kṛṣṇa is situated... Kṛṣṇa is not stereotyped in one place. Kṛṣṇa, He is in Goloka Vṛndāvana. <span class="Italic">Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa. I am sitting here; you are sitting here. I am not in my apartment, but Kṛṣṇa, although He is sitting in this temple, He is present everywhere. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this way we have to study Kṛṣṇa very scientifically, and the books are there, and we have tried to explain as far as possible. Take advantage of this institution. Don't waste a moment of your life. Take it very seriously. <span class="Italic">Āyuṣaḥ kṣaṇa eko 'pi na labhyaḥ svarṇa-koṭibhiḥ.</span> Take seriousness... Especially those who are educated, they should take serious consideration of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Try to understand each and every verse of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> especially, and, if possible, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> There are so many books. We have got program to publish at least eighty-four books like this, four hundred pages each. So we have already published fifty-four books. So if you want to understand Kṛṣṇa through science and philosophy, read these books. Otherwise-very easy method-come here; chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. There is no difficulty. Thank you very much.
