<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...take shelter at the lotus feet of Nitāi. <span class="Italic">Nitāi-pāda-kamala, koṭi candra suśītala.</span> Because the shelter is so cool, a thousand times cooler than the moon.... Where is that..., Yaśomatīnandana? He is not here? Yesterday he met Mādhava Mahārāja. So he had some talks. (chuckles) In that talk he mentioned that "Your Guru Mahārāja was previously a businessman, so.... And we are, from our childhood, we are Vaiṣṇava. So therefore he is doing business and getting money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Whew.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Kick him on the face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) No, don't say like that. But the thing is.... Business means.... Business means four things. Yes, we are businessman. I was student of economics. I know how to do business, and the business principle means you require four things: land, labor, capital, organization. So, ordinary man cannot do that. Otherwise, everyone would have done some business and become millionaires. But it requires these four things: land, labor, organization, and capital. So where you have got these? You have neither land, neither capital, neither place. So how you can do business? I am doing business because I have got all these things. I went to America-land. Then I worked-labor. Then I earned some capital, and I have got brain how to do it. (to Lokanātha) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So why you are becoming <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span>? This is <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yeah, I have to dye it today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't become <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> immediately. <span class="Italic">Paramahaṁsa</span> is the last stage of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> First stage is <span class="Italic">kuticaka.</span> Second stage is <span class="Italic">parivrājakācārya.</span> Third stage is.... No, first stage is <span class="Italic">kuticaka.</span> Then second stage is <span class="Italic">bahudaka, bahudaka.</span> And third stage is <span class="Italic">parivrājakācārya,</span> and fourth stage is <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> stage is the topmost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They have got white? Do they wear white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not under any rule and regulation, <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa. Paramahaṁsa</span> means, just like <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas,</span> they are not under any rules and regulation. Similarly, a <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> is also not under any rules and regulation. He can do whatever he likes. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> is not meant for him. <span class="Italic">Avadhūta.</span> He is not in the material world, <span class="Italic">mahābhāva.</span> So that is the last stage of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa. Kuṭicaka</span> means when from family life, <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> and then one takes <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> that is <span class="Italic">kuṭicaka. Kuṭicaka</span> means he does not remain at home but goes outside home, outside the village area and makes a <span class="Italic">kuti,</span> cottage, and lives there. But because he is not accustomed to beg, from his house some foodstuff is sent. Just like you are sending to that Sharma some food? This is <span class="Italic">kuṭicaka.</span> But after some time, when he's little experienced, then he goes from door to door: "Give me a piece of bread." <span class="Italic">Madhukārī. Madhukāra. Madhukāra</span> means the bee, honeybee. What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Bumblebee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bumblebee. He collects little honey here, little honey there, wherever.... And not one place so much honey. So this is called <span class="Italic">bahudaka.</span> Not to collect lump sum, food, from anywhere. To any <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> can go: "Please give me a little piece of bread." So that is not difficult. "All right, take." Because many <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> may come, so it is not burden, little piece. So as soon as it is sufficient piece, that's all. It is called <span class="Italic">bahudaka.</span> Then, when he's further experienced, then preaching country to country, place to place, go on preaching. That is <span class="Italic">parivrājakācārya.</span> And when he has sufficiently preached, then he can sit down anywhere. That is <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> [break] ...system. In every big temple there is <span class="Italic">shenai.</span> All through the year, morning, night, not only temple, rich man's house. And they are so nice player that early in the morning, people, the resident, will rise by hearing the <span class="Italic">shenai.</span> And at night they will go to bed and sleep hearing the <span class="Italic">shenai.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Was that early in morning or late at night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, other time also. But this time especially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They also used to keep cock, hens and the cock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] What is called? Alarm bell. Cocks. "<span class="Italic">Ka-ka-ka:</span> Get up please." "<span class="Italic">Ka-ka-ka.</span>" Nature's alarm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Sometimes they crow, though, at twelve o'clock at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to cheat you because you sleep more. (laughter) Because you sleep more, to cheat you. You do not rise early in the morning; therefore they are engaged sometimes to cheat you. [break] ...found a very nice house in London. Jayatīrtha is going to take the credit of purchasing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, we found a very nice house in London, and you're going to get the credit for purchasing it. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, if Kṛṣṇa desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything Kṛṣṇa does, but one takes credit. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We think that we're the doer, but actually Kṛṣṇa is the doer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's been a feeling that all year their hard work has all become worthwhile simply by coming here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes. Make it more.... Therefore I wanted first of all this house, not the temple, because where they'll stay? They'll come to the temple. Where they will stay? If you get staying place, then you can act your brain and improve. And if you are harassed-no place-then brain will not work. Therefore I wanted first of all the residential place. And they criticize me, "Oh, you did not construct temple first." And a temple of the devotees is first, our temple. Then God. God will come if there are devotees. <span class="Italic">Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyantī mad-bhaktāḥ.</span> Unless there is devotee, where is God? God is not a stone. Any stone is God? Unless there is devotees, there's no God. Therefore, without devotee: the idol, this is idol worship. That is not worship. Therefore they cannot understand what is the form, what is the distinction between form of the Lord and idol. They do not know how to worship in devotion. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are thinking, "It is stone, and God is remaining here, stone. He will never speak," because they are not devotee. If you become devotee.... Just like Sākṣī Gopāla. For devotee He went to give witness, "Yes, I'll walk." That is God. And if you are not devotee, how you can expect the stone statue is walking? You have read that Sākṣī Gopāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Gopāla was saying that "You are asking Me to go to give witness. Do you think a statue can go?" So he is devotee. He said, "Yes, if statue can speak, he can go also." So he had firm faith. So Kṛṣṇa had pledged him, "Yes, I'll go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think you also have that firm faith, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, without firm faith there is no beginning of God worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Niṣṭhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śraddhā śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Do you not read this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā,</span> this faith, means so strong faith that one will know it perfectly well that simply by worshiping Kṛṣṇa, everything is there. That is the beginning of faith. Otherwise there is no faith. And without faith there is no beginning. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā. Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you have got that firm faith, then next stage is to live with, to deal with devotees. Then the faith will increase because by seeing their behavior your faith will be increased. Then <span class="Italic">bhajana kriya.</span> Wherefrom this <span class="Italic">shenai</span> was...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Vaikuṇṭhanātha temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudama:</span> Originally he came from the Vaikuṇṭhanātha temple, Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's staying up in that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> They're in the front.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are expert in Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, when we went to Nellore, remember they were greeting you each time with <span class="Italic">shenai.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadravida:</span> Very expert in South India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can engage a company, three, four men, for all the year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> So they should.... Before <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati</span> they should begin playing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes, in Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the idea behind this <span class="Italic">shenai</span>-playing early in the morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very pleasing to hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Many temples also in South India, they have all the functions in the morning-waking up the Deity, bathing the Deity, dressing the Deity, they have different <span class="Italic">shenai</span> tunes for that. Every temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly here introduce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You should play your flute. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa knows how to play the flute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No flute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He can learn to play the <span class="Italic">shenai,</span> though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">shenai,</span> yes. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a man here that's been here. He knows how to play <span class="Italic">shenai.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm bringing him to Taiwan.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not difficult. Anyone can learn. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> [break] ...ing flute imitate Kṛṣṇa or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no flute. You say simply Kṛṣṇa plays flute and nobody plays?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You said no playing flute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Means in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are coming here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Circumambulating the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...very colorful with all the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> In South India, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> goes out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are taking this bamboo down? This?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> It's already down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Hah, down. Cleared out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is cleared. You men can live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees in distance:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> They have big umbrella overhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they did it. They did it in South India when I was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Nellore. That was wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We can make such arrangement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Ācāryopāsanam.</span> That is in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Ācāryopāsanam.</span> It is not self-aggrandizement. The <span class="Italic">ācāryopāsanā</span> goes to Kṛṣṇa directly. Therefore it is needed. Not that it is a pompous thing. <span class="Italic">Ācāryopāsanā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says. That is the way of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> How does that work, that if somebody has the association of a pure devotee for only a <span class="Italic">lava,</span> one-eleventh of a second, that he attains all perfection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he is so sincere.... Just like dried wood immediately ignites. And if it is moist, it does not. It is the quality of the wood. One takes three hundred years; one in three minutes. That's it. [break] One is dry from the material moist of contamination, he becomes immediately ignited in spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that drying process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drying process is for many, many years one has tried to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, for many, many lives, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When he actually becomes man of knowledge he surrenders unto God. Otherwise he is lost. His drying process may take three minute or three millions years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But that knowledge that Kṛṣṇa is everything comes by Kṛṣṇa's mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's mercy is already there, but if you are not able to take it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadravida:</span> Then you don't even have to hear from a self-realized soul. Simply by seeing him you can become completely purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Both required. The matches must be also all right, and the wood must be also. Then there is fire. If one of them is defective, then, it will not.... But when you go to the fire, you become dry. But willfully we put again water. This nonsense business makes us late. This process is already there, how to become dry. But instead of taking the process, we put water. Then how it will be ignited? The rules and regulations is the drying process. But without following the rules and regulation, if you again become a victimized by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then there is water and again dry it. So this is going on, watering and drying, watering and drying. No staightforward process for drying. That will help. But difficulty is that we dry and again water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, how did Choṭa Haridāsa achieve perfection by killing himself after apparently pouring water on his devotional creeper by talking to a woman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His instance was that even an associate of Caitanya Mahāprabhu can fall down. And if one falls down, his punishment is that, suicide. There is no other punishment. He must commit suicide. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruc.... Otherwise he is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's personal servant. He cannot fall down. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed this instance that "Even one is My personal servant, he can fall down." And if anyone by any cause he falls down, his punishment is he must commit suicide. This is instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very strict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. "You have fallen down? You must commit suicide. No more My association."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that the same as in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> where Kṛṣṇa says, "For one who is honored, dishonor is worse than death"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is another thing. Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally taught this. To be victimized by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is possi.... There is possibility.... Just like Jaya and Vijaya. They were gatekeepers in the Vaikuṇṭha. They also fell down, Hiraṇyakaśipu. So this falldown, there is possibility in any moment because we are very small. We can be captivated by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> at any moment. Therefore we shall be very, very careful. And if you fall down, then punishment is you make suicide. That's all. Then next life we shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But Śrīla Prabhupāda, in <span class="Italic">The Nectar of Devotion</span> it says devotional service is so pure that there's no <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta</span> necessary. Just again engage in your service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is not <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta.</span> This is exemplary punishment. He was not liable to be punished, but they played that "This is the.... This should be done."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He did not kill himself immediately. He waited for a year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was waiting if Caitanya Mahāprabhu would accept him again. But when he saw that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not so lenient, he committed suicide. <span class="Italic">Vajrād api kaṭora.</span> Harder than the thunderbolt and softer than the rose. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But, Prabhupāda, if you were as strict as.... If you were that strict...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not Caitanya Prabhu. I am not.... Why you are comparing me? I am an ordinary man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So in ISKCON, if someone falls down, it means that he should commit suicide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We wouldn't have much of a movement, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're too attached to our bodies anyway, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if he falls down, that is automatically suicide. If he falls down, that means it is suicide. He got the chance. If he falls down, that is suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Spiritual suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual suicide. If one gets the chance of becoming eligible for going back to home, back to Godhead, and if he commits mistake and it is stopped, is it not suicide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You once gave the example, Śrīla Prabhupāda, of taking your plane off the ground and then bringing it back to land again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You once gave the example that you take your plane to a destination, and you have to turn around and come back and start all over again, take off again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vrata. Bhajante mam dṛḍha-vrata.</span> So we should be very strong-minded and continue our devotional service very strongly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gargamuni's doing some transaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gargamuni...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I think he went to see about the electricity. He said that he was going to go early this morning to see about the electricity, why it is always going off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Garga, <span class="Italic">garga</span> means "big jug," and "money," full of money. Big jug full of coins. Formerly they used to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Keep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not.... Cheat the government. There was no income tax, but still they used to keep in big, big jugs all gold coins and put into the..., underneath the ground. Nobody could understand where is the money. Very easy thing.</div>
