<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, as young children we used to have to put our hand over our heart and say a pledge to the flag, in America. And if one didn't say it, they were thrown out of school. They changed that law now. It's not required. It used to be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mental concoction will be changed. <span class="Italic">Manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Their only business is mental concoction: today it is good, tomorrow it is bad. That is mental concoction. If mind likes it, it is good; if mind does not like it, it is bad. No standard. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have hospitals for animals, if your animal gets sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mostly dogs and cats, birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The animal that was making the noise was the man on the porch. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Many people have horses in the neighborhood. They have horse shows, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They spend lots of money on fancy horses, and in this way, one becomes greater than another by showing his horses. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...slam the door. The door is secure or not? [break] ...trying to find out that happiness from this body, that is mistake. That happiness is there in the spirit soul, not this body. Happiness is our right. <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> By nature, we want happiness. Mistaking, where is the happiness. The living being, he is to enjoy happiness. But they are trying to give happiness to the body, which is dead. <span class="Italic">Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> The body is dead from the very beginning, but they are trying to draw happiness from the dead matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Chewing the chewed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and that is not being fulfilled. Therefore planning, sometimes this way, sometimes that way. <span class="Italic">Manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Mental concoction. Real platform they are missing. Sometimes sitting down, sometimes... (laughter) Happiness. When tired up, then come down. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They come out for a quiet sit-down in the countryside, and they bunch together, hundreds at a time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They are coming to watch the fireworks. You see, from here, the fireworks are going to be very high in the sky. They can see it from this point. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...celebration, independence from our point of view?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From our point of view, it doesn't have any meaning. For a conditioned soul to think that he's independent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think they're free from being controlled by the British, for example. Free from being controlled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is some meaning. That's all right. But where is your independence? You are fully under the control of the laws of nature. So where is your independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> There is none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply dog dancing is independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Ultimately, they are declaring their independence of God, Kṛṣṇa. They can do as they like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is that independence? You can declare anything. A crazy man can say anything, but where is your independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In fact, they are bound up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Where is the question of independence? Whatever you do not want, it is being forced upon you. So where is your independence? Nobody wants any miseries. So everyone is miserable condition. Struggle for existence means to get out of miserable condition. So where is the independence? Now there is mist. How you can say you are independent? You cannot drive this mist, this fog. Unless sun rises, it cannot be cleared. So where is your independence? There may be so many accidents. Actually, it so happens. But you do not want. But here is an unfortunate. So where is your independence? It is not under your control. If the sun rises, then it can be dissipated. Otherwise, there is no question. Poor thoughts. What is here, this park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> That's a private community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Perhaps everyone is hopeful that the sun will rise for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, sun is not your father's servant. He may not. It is not under your control. That is the point. You may think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can only be hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Hope against hope. Independence means fully under your control. Whatever you like, you can do. Where is that independence?</div>
<div class="Verse">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni<br class="calibre2"/>guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā<br class="calibre2"/>kartāham iti manyate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.27]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Foolishly thinking that "I am independent." Has anyone anything to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> I was thinking that they are talking of independence, but they cannot even become independent of old age and disease. Their body, they try to control things, but their own body is out of control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One may say that if there's no independence, then where is the question of initiative in the material world, taking initiative?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Initiative? What is that question? Initiative I understand, but do you think that by taking initiative of independence you become independent, like this, by dancing and fireworks, you become independent? This is initiative, dancing like dogs, (sings) "We are independent, we are independent." (laughter) Does it have any meaning? Dance like a dog, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's a big show, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They will say that they can do so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they can do? They cannot do anything. At any moment, you can be kicked out, "Get out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> But they have choice within <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Isn't that a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Choice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Choice what to do in the material world, many different fields. They will say that they can do this or that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many fields, that is also conditioned. That is conditioned, that is not independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One has choice to become a dog or a cat, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is conditioned. Therefore it is called conditioned life. There is no question of independence. That is foolishness. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that they are not independent, completely under the control of laws of material nature, and still they are thinking independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is like a prisoner in the prison house thinking he has some freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That freedom is <span class="Italic">danda jane raja jana nadi secu bhau.</span>(?) Drowning the man in the water and, "Now you have independence, so breathe." (laughter) So he breathes in, "Ah! Ah!" "All right, you are now a little relieved, all right, again. Again become drown." "Oh! Save me, save me, save me, save me." "All right," take out, "now breathe, independently." This is independence. <span class="Italic">Danda jane raj jana nadi secu bhai.</span>(?) The rascal does not know "I am breathing independent, but at any moment I can be drowned again." Very correct example, <span class="Italic">danda jane raja jana nadi secu bhai.</span>(?) No independence. Independence is only there when you fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa. You surrender your all independence to Kṛṣṇa. Then there is. "Kṛṣṇa, I have foolishly acted as independent, so many lives. Now I surrender all my independence at Your lotus feet. If You like, You can kill me; if You like, You can...," that is independence. Otherwise, there is no independence. All foolishness. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> By false egotism, he's thinking that "I am independent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Misusing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Misusing the energy. Yesterday, some two and half million the government has spent, and we also, combined together, we have spent ten million by power, gas, going there and coming. So many cars. Another ten million. So all these twelve million, three, thirteen million dollars spent for nothing. Dancing like dogs, independence, <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> [break] (out of car) Ask him this question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda was saying in the car that yesterday the American people were declaring their independence. So he's asking what is the value to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What is the value of it? They are enjoying their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now dog dancing. What is that song? Dog dancing? I sang that song?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (sings) "We are independent, we are independent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> (laughs) That is the spirit of patriotism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, you can say any name, any style or any trademark. Where is the independence? That is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But Śrīla Prabhupāda blessed yesterday around the Capitol. There were so many people, and they seemed like they liked...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many people, there are so many earthworms also. Ants also, gathered together. Does it mean they are independent? Hare Kṛṣṇa. You know the earthworms? They heap up earth and disappear. So you are, if you take it in that way, that big, big buildings, just like earthworms gathering up earth and then disappears. Actually that is the... Like the worms, we gather together and become a nation and apply all our energy, heaps of buildings, then finished. We go somewhere, you go somewhere. And who knows what he's going to be next life? Everything is going like that, family, community, national. Like the same earthworm, they gather so much huge <span class="Italic">dipi...,</span> what is called <span class="Italic">dipi</span> (?)in English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Some sort of manure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are <span class="Italic">dipi.</span> (?)We are <span class="Italic">dipi.</span> We <span class="Italic">dipi.</span> You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Teepee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, big heaps, mountains, hills?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not hills. Anyway, small or big, they gather together and then goes away, finished by the laws of nature. Washington, he gave you independence, but where he is? What he is doing? Where is that person who gave you independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Would you like to walk this way today, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There is a basic difference between the earthworm and the man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No difference. It is also living entity, you are also living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But difference in the sense that the earthworm is, actually, it is not trying to violate the laws of nature. Just follows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from that, the process of life is the same, biological. These rascals say that there is no soul of the animal, but is it correct biologically?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is biologically wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you see the way physical and atomical constitution of the animal and the man, the same. If you say man has soul, then the animal has also soul. If you deny that man has no soul, then you can also deny. But so far physiological... They, in the biological laboratory, they dissect the frogs to see the similar arrangement. So how you can you say the frog has no soul? Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, on Saturday Svarūpa Dāmodara was talking about the scientific proof of the Absolute Truth from the Kṛṣṇa conscious point of view. When one realizes Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth, does one also see like how the physical world is manifesting itself? Do we understand all physical laws, how chemicals are combining, or...? What do we actually understand when we understand the Absolute Truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Absolute Truth, there is direction. Scientific explanation is... You were showing the picture that everything is being performed under some direction, not whimsically. Therefore there is somebody dictating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> You see the cause of everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> These are the natural falls here, Prabhupāda, not manmade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Not manmade. [break] It is not necessary to take millions of years for life to develop, because within five days an egg is there and life is being manifest. But scientists are saying it took millions of years to come to that stage where in five days it would only take life to become manifest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are waiting millions of years? Accept that millions of years passed, now let us have it in five days. Why you are again asking to wait for millions of years? If it has passed? Rascal. From the sky, Atlantic, wherefrom... Big, big chunks like mountains constantly coming, <span class="Italic">cut-cut-cut-cut-cut-cut.</span> In Canada, big, big chunks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ice, flood, every second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Down the fall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not from Canada, somewhere else, the Atlantic. And it is falling in the Atlantic Ocean. That broke the Titanic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, iceberg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, iceberg. Throughout the whole year, every second coming. [break] ...trees have fallen are grown like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Old trees, Śrīla Prabhupāda, dead ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the fall goes that side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes. There's another place-I'm not exactly sure; I think it's down much further-where there's much bigger falls. This is just a small place. It's not the main falls. We can go there on another walk, I think, if you want to see the big falls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chicken is giving life to the egg within five days, and you are scientist, you have to wait for millions of years. So chicken is better than you. (laughter) Why, rascal, you claim as scientist? Better, a chicken is better than you. Chicken is giving just after sitting on the egg. In five days, there is living entity. You rascal, you have to wait. So why you talk? Better don't talk. It is better not to talk than to talk foolish. Where is the scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If they don't talk, then don't get jobs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Then they'll say plainly that "I'm hungry; give some food. Then I'll not talk nonsense. Give me some food." That's all. Take it. Tell the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If they talk these things, they can get money from the government, millions of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So instead of talking all nonsense, tell freely that "I am hungry, give me some food."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually, that's what happens in principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have finished all their talks. So far as I know, these so-called scientists, they have finished their business. Now they have no other means than to bluff. To get their salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, actually the research is also getting more and more difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, what they'll research? Everything finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their imagination is running out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, the ideas are running out. That's why now they are doing on the biological sciences mainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. There is another nonsense. Why they are checking the flow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> The water is too rough for the boats to travel, so they made this artificial canal so boats could travel without getting wrecked, and they could transport their items of sense gratification in that way. They used to have mules that pulled the boats with ropes alongside here, these pathways, pulled them through the canal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will grow mosquitoes, mosquito plant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mosquitoes. When the devotees came back from India, many got malaria, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So I think we got to do something next year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get a mosquito curtain. That's all. Get a mosquito curtain. In India everywhere there is mosquito. I think in your country also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, yes, many mosquitoes. They are also in Florida, many mosquitoes, when it rains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tropical climate, there is mosquitoes. [break] That is falls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, it's just a ravine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> One of the members of the temple here, Prabhupāda, is a doctor, and he was doing some research into malaria, saying that many of the chemicals that they were using to kill these mosquitoes in India are becoming ineffectual. And now the mosquitoes are bigger and they aren't able to control it, so malaria is going to be a problem during the breeding season this year, much worse problem they've created for themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a place in India, Jabalpura, there is a fall passing, Narmada, and these stones are all marble, first class. Very nice place. I went there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You mentioned in Hawaii how there are planets where instead of having grains of sand on the beach, they have jewels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jewels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Some scientists find it hard to understand the description of different planets wherein there are oceans of milk, because we know that there's oceans of water here, and that water has to be there to create rain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why the rascal carry this idea there? Has he seen everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> No, but he cannot understand how an ocean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how he can understand? He's a fool. How he can understand? [break] ...into the moon planet, what does he understand about water there? There are so many millions and trillions of planets. How he can understand what is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Where did the astronauts go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll go to hell (laughter). To pick up some sand, as if sand is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is <span class="Italic">māyā</span> especially empowering the scientists to come up with nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> It is all coming from Kṛṣṇa, though, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because you want to be fool, Kṛṣṇa makes you a better fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> He's also the greatest cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...to become devotee. And if you want to become rogue, He'll give you all facility to become rogue. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's so kind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we're doing all these studies about science from a Kṛṣṇa conscious point of view, and yet the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> didn't care anything for this; they just simply wanted to love Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not care for anything except Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are all perfect. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Do we accept the way bacteria's reproduce, by fission, splitting in half? I know Kapiladeva instructs there are four different methods-the egg, the lump of flesh, etc. The scientists are saying that bacteria split in half and produce two daughter cells.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bacteria is produced from fermentation. <span class="Italic">Sveda-ja.</span> Just like nasty bedding, from your perspiration, if you don't clean, then bugs will come. <span class="Italic">Sveda-ja.</span> In India, the Europeans they eat meat, and automatically bugs and germs come within their coat and shirt due to bad perspiration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When you say that they're born from perspiration like cockroaches, does that mean that the eggs are laid by the female and then the atmosphere of perspiration enables the eggs to be hatched? Like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, from the perspiration automatically it comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Prabhupāda, we say that everything is situated on desire, and as a person surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> He rewards accordingly. But people don't understand. Just like if there's a mother and father, and the child is not doing well, they try to mold that child's desire properly, the way that they see as proper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He's coming, Kṛṣṇa, personally, "Rascal, give up all these ideas. Surrender to Me." But who is accepting it? He's coming for this purpose; He's leaving His instruction, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>; He's sending His devotee; but who is caring to accept that? He's very much anxious to do good to you. If you don't accept, what can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> In the case of a devotee...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotees, they accept. Therefore they are happy. And they'll be happy. They'll go back to home happy. One who accepts, he becomes happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Well, in the case where a devotee is definitely sincerely following your instructions and applying himself to all these principles that Kṛṣṇa has outlined, then when there's difficulty for him, how is he to understand that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot understand immediately. He must be patient. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān dhairyāt. Dhairya</span> means patience. He cannot, if you have sown some seed, you cannot expect immediately tree and fruits. You must wait. You must nourish the plant, water it. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.152]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> But if there is some difficulty that causes so much trouble in your service...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is impatience. That is impatience. Either he does not do properly his duty, or he is impatient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Impatience means fruitive. Fruitive. He's looking for some results.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediate result, immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> But isn't there a point, Prabhupāda, at which, you know, you can expect that you've been doing the right things, so there should be some relief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything takes time. Suppose a girl is married. So she wants a child. It does not mean today she's married and next day child. It is not possible. Wait. You'll have child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That is faith, Prabhupāda? If the woman has faith in the husband...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith or no faith, if they live husband and wife, there will be child. That's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> That's why they had to build this canal, because it was too rocky for boats. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...potency of <span class="Italic">hari-nāma-kīrtana,</span> everyone will join. We have to be sincerely working, then everything... Kṛṣṇa will. Natural, even child, drunkard, sane man, everyone was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Yes, they were all dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The proof was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> You said last night that actually they all want to dance, but they're artificially checking. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birth, death. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I saw Niagara Falls, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> You have seen? How do you like it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very nice. The water is very clean. Īśāna took me there when I was (at) Buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's the biggest fall in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Biggest fall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have seen in Jabalpura, that is also very big fall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There is one in Africa as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Victoria Falls. I've seen that. It's a mile wide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vancouver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Victoria, Rhodesia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Africa there's a very big fall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's not the biggest one either though. The biggest fall is in Venezuela.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Might be some on some other planets we don't know about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Has there ever been debates on the authenticity of modern science, or is this the first time modern science has been challenged in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India, Vedic civilization never cared for anything which is searched out by imperfect human beings. They never cared for it. Because he knows the man who is searching after, he's imperfect. Whatever he'll do, that is imperfect. Therefore neglect it. That is Vedic civilization. <span class="Italic">Śruti-pramāṇa:</span> whether it is evident from the <span class="Italic">śrutis,</span> from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Otherwise, they reject it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Prabhupāda, if spiritual life and Kṛṣṇa are stronger than <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then how is it that religion was ever overcome to the extent it is now? In Kali-yuga it's so much neglected, whereas in past ages we learn that it wasn't neglected. How is it that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> got such a stronghold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a time, just like young man and old man. Old man is dwindling, young man is growing. It is a question of time. Kali-yuga is bad time. Therefore <span class="Italic">māyā</span> has got chance to flourish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Eight minutes to seven, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If those people in India who are aware of the actual science, though, if they had come out and spoken against material scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> You're the only one though, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, one problem we face with students and scientists, when we present Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy, they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We don't condemn the scientists. We say that "Take credit as much as you can. But why do you defy the existence of God?" That is our protest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> They want to be God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Is Kali-yuga the age when desires become manifest like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, the question is that do people who have such types of low-grade desires take birth in the Kali-yuga. So the question is that, naturally, yes, everyone is taking birth according to their <span class="Italic">karma.</span> But we can change our destiny by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Just like if a sick man is offered medicine, so if he takes medicine, then he can become cured from his disease. Similarly, Kali-yuga means very high temperature, and the medicine is there in the form of the holy name, <span class="Italic">harer nāma</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we have to take advantage. Otherwise everyone in Kali-yuga is condemned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have we not published that "You have created 747. All right, take credit. But you cannot make a mosquito with pilot. Can you?" "No." "So why..., how can you defy the supreme creator?" We are taking it, there is supreme creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That basic point they find it hard to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because they are blind. It is common sense, that you have created the 747. So somebody must have created this, a small insect. This is common sense. You cannot see Him: that is your bad fortune. But somebody has done it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, that's our logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> To be able to be so fooled, that is the greatest wonder, how it's so obvious that there's a creator, but yet one can say there is no creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. That we are protesting, that "You rascal, you stop this nonsense talking." There is son and there is mother; there must be father. This is conclusion. And "I do not see father. I do not see that." But without father, how there can be son? This is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Prabhupāda, one the one hand you say the scientists are rascals, and on the other you say not to condemn them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the rascal means when they say there is no God. Then they are rascals. Here is a scientist-he does not say that there is no God. Anyone who says there is no God, he's a rascal. He may be scientist, philosopher, or anyone. (break-back in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'm a bit puzzled about this, these entities that are born from perspiration, like that. It seems that there's no father and mother, yet like we were just using the argument that there must be a father and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is father and mother. The supreme father is Kṛṣṇa, and mother is nature, ultimately. So perspiration is also another form of nature. Yes. There's always father and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> There's no material father, though? In that case?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material father is not material. Real father is Kṛṣṇa. He may come in so many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The thing is that the scientists may isolate some cockroaches in a box, and they will watch the cockroaches secrete eggs and this or that or whatever-I don't know exactly how the cockroaches...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not, give up cockroach. There are many other living entities, they come from perspiration. Take for..., bugs. Bugs, they come from perspiration. Many, many come by fermentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, but it seems that form of the bug must come from the form of another bug.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So it's very difficult to understand how it comes from perspiration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The form is coming directly. Why from another? The form is, the birth is coming directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From the perspiration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And those who are coming, they will take that form, buglike form, and drink blood. That is all destined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So just like a spirit soul, say, in a human form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit soul, according to his desires, he's gotten that body. But that body is coming from perspiration. That is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So like in our case, the spirit soul takes shelter in the semen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, according to his desire he's given shelter to such and such place, and he comes out with body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And in that case he take shelter in the perspiration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Daiva-netreṇa.</span> That is by superior administration, he has to take shelter and take out the body, come and act. It requires little brain. The dull meat-eaters cannot understand, the drunkards and meat-eaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They do not even know about that kind of birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even in their meat there will be so many germs. What they know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> The common people think that by cooking the meat they kill so many worms and germs in their meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> But studies have shown that certain worms and germs are not killed, and they are ingested into the body and cause diseases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You take the yogurt, even by microscope, you see so many germs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yogurt is made by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even a drop of water there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bacteria. Lactic acid. Bacteria.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I've seen that these cattle that are raised for eating, they are not like dairy cows. Dairy cows are much cleaner. Beef cattle are very dirty animals. They have no clean habits. They are almost like pigs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Still, they should be protected, though. They should be used for plowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if they are not cows, there is no need of protection. When gives milk, that is cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> These animals are created by man actually. History...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it would have been a bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bull also required, because cows alone cannot give milk unless united with bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The philosophy now with the farmers is that if there's a bull born, generally they kill it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the law in England. You cannot keep a bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The only reason they keep a male animal is just for meat. Bullocks, one year old, and then they send them to the slaughterhouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere, in India, they require bulls and... Generally, they are not inclined to kill. So they are engaged in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But otherwise, when Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya,</span> He means the female, the cow, giving milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Actually, in these beef animals, if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Go</span> means species, means both bull and cow, but generally <span class="Italic">go</span> means cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Of the two, the cow is the more important because it gives milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> One thing is these beef cows, the female, they only produce enough milk for a little offspring. They have made it like that. You cannot get enough milk from them. They have little bags, only just for their own offspring. They have made it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manmade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes, a manmade idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How does that fit in with the species of life, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when they combine two different species, artificial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can make, by arrangement, artificial, cross-breeding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But that cannot be counted as one of the 8,400,000 forms. I was thinking last night when we were coming down this road that it's very nice and smooth, but then I thought you were saying the other morning that in the heavenly planets they are made from coral and so many different things. Here we're using tarmac.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The more you go higher planetary system, the standard of living is many, many thousand times better than this. Many, many thousand times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We can't even imagine it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What to speak of the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just suppose here are stones, there are pearls. You cannot imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Lying on the roadside. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Western scientists, philosophers, they are all Dr. Frogs. They simply calculating three feet water, that's all. As soon as you speak to them about Atlantic Ocean, they say, "Oh, it is impossible." Froggish brain. [break] ...word has come, <span class="Italic">kūpa-māṇḍūkya-nyāya,</span> the frog in the well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda, is that example also given in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>? Frog in the well? Sometimes you use all these different examples, and they are all there in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> I was just wondering if this frog in the well was also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You use very graphic examples; they're very perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, my Guru Mahārāja used to use to place so many examples, (laughs) I do not know all of them. No, there is a book, <span class="Italic">Nyāya-śāstra,</span> logic. You'll find all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that the <span class="Italic">Nīti-śāstra</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nīti-śāstra</span> is different. This is <span class="Italic">Nyāya-śāstra.</span></div>
